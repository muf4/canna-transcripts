[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's always awesome to come here
because there's so many plant biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I exist in an environment where
I'm usually talking to people with an MD
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than a PhD degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to give some real
botany about maize anthers, and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see how a new class of small RNAs
called FASI RNAs influence anther
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I want to tell you how to build
an anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in maize, there are three flora
primordia, and these little bumps are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the stamens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these stamens initials basically use
up most of the meristem, and there's cells
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from the L1 layer of the meristem
and from both of the L2 layers of the
[SPEAKER_00]: monocot meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's about 100 cells at the
beginning in each of these stamens
[SPEAKER_00]: initials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really remarkable to me is that
nine days later, at the start of meiosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've built each anther into this four
lobe structure subtended by a filament,
[SPEAKER_00]: which contains the vascular column,
which proceeds up through the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: each anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's now about 50,000 cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pace of cell division in anthers is
cell division about every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is faster than the million cells in
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there's patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from these meristem-derived laters,
within each lobe, we end up with an
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermis from the L1 and four cell types
from this subepidermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endothesium, which is colored green
because it actually has chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle layer of more or less unknown
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tapetal cells, which are nutritive
cells for the archosporial, then pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: mother cells, and myocytes, and later the
microgumetophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have a fast pace of cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first question we really asked
was, where do the cell types, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: get started making an anther?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the old model was that there was a
primary large cell called the hypodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of borrowed from fern
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this giant layer two cell would
divide to make a somatic cell to the
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior and an archosporial, a premiotic
cell to the interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually copied from my
undergraduate botany notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made no sense to me because the next
drawing the teacher made was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we have a ring of soma around that
central reproductive cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't seem very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so rather than using transverse
sections, which everyone had done up to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point, we switched to using confocal
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could make a more robust description
of what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early anther, here's the
incipient four lobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do it by confocal, you can never
find the giant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this one transverse image from the
confocal, probably everyone can pick out a
[SPEAKER_00]: cell that looks bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually do all the volumes,
there is no giant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, what happens is there's continual
division kind of in any plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at a longitudinal view
of a small anther until there's cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: only have L2D neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before that, every L2D cell touched a
presumptive epidermal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this white dot shows you a cell that
is completely surrounded now by L2D cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that event, which you can image in any
view, combined with a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: glutoradoxin called MISCA-1, and I'll tell
you later hypoxia, which is transduced
[SPEAKER_00]: through this glutoradoxin, causes cells
like this to greatly enlarge and become
[SPEAKER_00]: the archipelago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first type of cell that's specified
in an anther lobe is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: premiotic cell, the archosporial cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these cells then secrete a small
protein ligand called MAC-1 that causes
[SPEAKER_00]: the differentiation of the soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't a special hypodermal cell
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sequence of events that results
in specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process takes approximately a day
to make a column of archosporial cells
[SPEAKER_00]: down the length of the anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also solves an old question in
flowering plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hypodermal cell model, all of the
pollen grains from one lobe would have had
[SPEAKER_00]: one progenitor cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in maize, at least, there's 10 to 12 of
these progenitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the anther is growing quickly at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that occurs primarily by anticlinal
divisions that add length and girth to the
[SPEAKER_00]: anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an extremely important job of these
archosporial cells is to secrete MAC-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that causes the L2D neighbor,
the cell that's just subepidermal,
[SPEAKER_00]: to undergo a periclinal division,
setting up the endothesium, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: layer adjacent to the anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the epidermis and a subepidermal
cell called the secondary parietal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cell will later divide periclinally
to make the middle layer in the tapetum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our discoveries, after kind of
figuring out the sequence of events in
[SPEAKER_00]: ontogeny, was that environmental
conditions actually trigger the
[SPEAKER_00]: specification of that archosporial cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its hypoxia is the environmental
trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was not quite a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graduate student involved,
Tim Kelleher, had done a lot of RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, transcriptome analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early days of that,
let's go back to 2010 or so, what you
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up with huge piles of data and no
insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what paid off was, a long,
long time ago, I had worked on hypoxic
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I looked at the transcriptome of
these very immature anthers, I saw all the
[SPEAKER_00]: signature that I had seen in young root
tissue that was exposed to excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used an oxygen electrode that's
contained inside this 26 gauge needle to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the amount of oxygen in the
airspace around the developing tassel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right when this specification event
occurs, the column of air that's inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the whirl of maize leaves out here near
the surface, it's close to ambient,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes down, down, down, because the
young leaves are not photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're living off respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sucking the air, the oxygen out of
this air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so around the tassel, it's down at
1.4% oxygen for about three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's enough to cause the
specification of that column of
[SPEAKER_00]: archosporial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went on to do experimental tests of
that by using tiny needles, or hoses,
[SPEAKER_00]: threaded down the column of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we attached the hoses to either an
oxygen tank or a nitrogen tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could add lots of extra oxygen or
purge it all out with nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: making it super hypoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of a complicated slide,
but the punchline is that if you use
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, that is make it more hypoxic,
you get precocious and extra archosporia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, violating one of the fundamentals
of botany, we could convert epidermal
[SPEAKER_00]: cells to premiotic cells if we applied the
hypoxia severely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen delays the specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at just this graph,
importantly though, here in green is what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So precocious and seemingly extra,
but it tops out at the same point as
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the oxygen treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process is self-regulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up at the same point, even if
you're delayed by adding oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key event here is the archosporial
cell specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act through this MAC1 small molecule
on these subepidermal L2D cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: converting them to primary parietal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cells then undergo the periclinal
division that sets up the two somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this ontogeny was very satisfying
in terms of an explanation, but we had
[SPEAKER_00]: still many, many questions about MAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew from experiments I'm not
showing that it's a secreted protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's processed to a smaller form and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of things we couldn't determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when archosporial cells
secrete this protein, does it act globally
[SPEAKER_00]: or does it act locally?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in plant biology, we're often thinking
of hormones, say in the vasculature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they arrive someplace and they
influence a lot of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep in mind that these
anthrolobes have no meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no organizing center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this small molecule being secreted by a
newly specified cell could be a type of
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing center, a type of organizing
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these questions sort of haunted
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we solved it,
at least in part, was to convert a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen we've worked with called
ustelagomatous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fungal pathogen that's a biotroph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kill or even enter Mase cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it hits a Mase cell, it causes the
plasma membrane of the Mase cell to
[SPEAKER_00]: invaginate so that the fungal hypha is
inside this apoplastic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we engineered ustelago to secrete the
MAC1 protein under a ustelago promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: that acts on the second and third day
after infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was enough time for the fungus to
get sub-epidermally and be in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: those L2D cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the important experiment was to apply
this special strain, which we call a
[SPEAKER_00]: trojan horse, because it's delivering a
secret package, the MAC1 protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the walls, the epoplastic space of the
plant, was to ask what happens in a MAC1
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a schematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a tracing of a confocal
image of what a fertile anthro looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's archosporial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's subepidermal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here in MAC1, there's epidermis
and subepidermal cells and archosporial
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've colored them differently because
there's just one layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here there's two layers because the
periclinal division has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we infect with a control strain
of ustelago that has no cargo other than a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent protein, we can track the
hyphae inside Mase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these arrows point to regions that
have that biotrophic interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's nifty about the biotrophic
interface is it's approximately the same
[SPEAKER_00]: width as the space between a typical
archosporial cell and its putative somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of recreating the distance
that the protein would have to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the trojan horse strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a similar number of biotrophic
interfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could find in the fungi both as
made from the gene and the process
[SPEAKER_00]: secreted form of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important assay was how often
are there additional cells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrated by the L2D cell that then are
where the fungal hyphae have made this
[SPEAKER_00]: intimate association that have undergone
the periclinal division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the control strain, it's really
low, under 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have the trojan horse it's
about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So way more than half of the penetrated
cells that received the MAC1 protein
[SPEAKER_00]: underwent the periclinal division,
but no neighbor cell ever did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means that the MAC1 signal is cell
autonomous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's secreted by an archosporial cell and
it has to act on a recipient cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably there's a receptor and we later
cloned receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a homolog of the rice MSP1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no signaling between these L2D
cells that say, oh, I saw MAC1 so you
[SPEAKER_00]: should do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cell needs to get the signals
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to defining this positive
signal, we also defined a repressive
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's controlled by an epidermal
transcription factor called OCL4 and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a mobile signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll learn more about what the
identity of that might be later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it suppresses extra subepidermal,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: endothelial periclinal divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the OCL4 mutant, instead of having
just one layer of subepidermal endothelial
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, you have two layers in half of the
sphere, you might say, of the lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the outer, like the northern
hemisphere basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the MAC1 mutant, when it's just MAC1,
you have lots and lots of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: archosporial cells because the soma isn't
specified and it basically stops dividing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the central space as the anther grows
just fills with pre-miotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make the double mutant,
the subepidermal cells in the absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever OCL4 does undergo a periclinal
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two controls of this really
important setup of the soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is an activating signal, the MAC1
ligand, and the other is a repressive
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's become a common theme in
developmental biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply the gas and get more of
something, you also need to have breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that you can stop it in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a review slide now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was going to be an exam,
I would hear all the four color pens in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room click, summarizing what we've
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we initiate archosporial specification
by hypoxia, which is naturally imposed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that corn grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it acts through misca one,
a glutoridoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the misca one mutant, no archosporial
cells are specified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, once the AR are there, shown in
purple, they secrete MAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they convert their neighbor L2D cells
one at a time to primary parietal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the job of those PPC cells is to
divide periclinally to make the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: parietal layer and the endotheseum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then OCL4 acts from the epidermis to
prevent these green cells from dividing
[SPEAKER_00]: periclinally again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're up to date now about
mesanthurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out OCL4 has another job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is it controls the production of
21 nucleotide FASI RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These FASI RNAs, the biogenesis factors
are localized in the epidermis exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: where the OCL4 transcription factor
localizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the FASI RNAs are small and they
accumulate throughout the soma of the
[SPEAKER_00]: antler lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be the mobile signal that
suppresses periclinal division.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that for sure, but that's
our working hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before sort of talking more about that
hypothesis, I think I need to tell you a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit what FASI RNAs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we discovered these in 2006,
working with Sundar's lab at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working on rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working on corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lou Bowman came from Clemson
University to do some work in my lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: he was an expert on small RNA and kind of
boom, we had all these small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so mystified by them, we didn't
publish for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, for graduate students,
don't despair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you don't, if you don't
understand something, sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: better to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we waited for a few years and then
we published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that these small RNAs were
mysterious, I know recall that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrington lab and others had by then
found TASI RNAs, transacting small
[SPEAKER_00]: interfering RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they're kind of a forest of
different small interfering RNAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hallmark of each and every one of
those is it had an mRNA target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our problem is the FASI RNAs have no
targets that you can identify in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do not match a messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some other function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to confess now, that's still the
state of the art, although we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: guesses about what they might be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now you'll want to know how to
make one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who are familiar with
the biogenesis of transacting,
[SPEAKER_00]: silencing RNAs, the sort of steps are
really similar, but there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: players.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the 21 nucleotide FASIs in maize,
there's approximately 440 different loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make a long non-coding RNA that
gets capped and polyadenylated just like
[SPEAKER_00]: an mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This molecule is then bound by an
argonaut, an argonaut one, that's carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: a microRNA called 2118.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just discovered, and it's
unpublished and likely to be unpublished
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, that this complex is actually
bound to a ribosome, bound to ribosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say polysomes, and that almost
all of the FAS loci contain short ORFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short ORF ensures loading onto the
ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does act, you might say,
like a messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have yet to find any of the peptide,
predicted peptides though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not sure if they're translated or
they could have a very short half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, on the ribosome, there is cleavage
by the microRNA 2118 right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost simultaneous copying by reverse
transcriptase, RDR6, that makes the second
[SPEAKER_00]: strand of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then DICER4 attaches to this
double-stranded region and precisely chops
[SPEAKER_00]: it, starting at the five prime end,
into 21 nucleotide, double-stranded
[SPEAKER_00]: segments, only one of which is typically
preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these retained small RNAs are bound by
AGO5C, and they constitute the 21
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide FASI RNA population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the 24 nucleotide FASIs have a very
similar ontogeny, but they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different specific microRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a different region of
complementarity than these guys to a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific microRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're copied by RDR6, but then a novel
DICER that's basically monocot-specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene duplication from DICER3 dates
back about 80 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is POA and some closely related
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: DICER5 chops it into 24 nucleotide small
RNAs, and we don't yet know what argonaut
[SPEAKER_00]: binds those small RNAs, and it makes a
large population of 24 nucleotide FASIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a typical precursor generates between
20 and 50 small RNAs each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that we discovered them so
long ago when methods were really crude is
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are unbelievably abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also show very distinct temporal
deployment in anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are anther-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the POA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other plants, they are at least
floral-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be anther-specific,
but people haven't dissected anthers to
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back here at 0.2 millimeter is right
when the archosporial cells are being
[SPEAKER_00]: specified, and 0.4 is when the somatic
cell specification has finished,
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of the cells, the primary
parietal cells, have undergone the
[SPEAKER_00]: periclastic spinal division that sets up
the endothelium and the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: parietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the 21 nucleotide FASA microRNA
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it's made a little bit
before the 0.4 stage, but it peaks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the FAS loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're incredibly abundant at 0.4 from
barely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the proportion of all 21
nucleotide small RNAs, including all the
[SPEAKER_00]: microRNAs that are actually FASy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 0.4, approximately 65% of all 21
nucleotide RNAs are FASy RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proportion declines over time,
but they're retained through mid-meiosis
[SPEAKER_00]: at reasonably abundant levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the 24 nucleotide FAS loci,
there's a tiny bit of transcript
[SPEAKER_00]: production and small RNA production early,
but the big bang, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: of setting up the precursors and the
microRNA that are required starts at 1
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter, which is the transition
between archosporial cells and pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: mother cells, if you're tracking the
germinal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also, as I'll point out in more
detail later, a time when the tapetum
[SPEAKER_00]: re-differentiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then peak abundance of the 24
nucleotide FASy's occurs at 2 millimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is late, prophase one towards the
end, could be the end of meiosis one,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're close to 70% of all the 24
nucleotide small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys were easy to find,
even with crude methods, if you dissected
[SPEAKER_00]: answers at the right stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of them is millions of
copies per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about a huge amount of
small RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also always track other types of small
RNA, those repressors of transposons and
[SPEAKER_00]: TAS3 type small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in addition to temporal
separation of now what are two classes of
[SPEAKER_00]: small RNA, FASy RNAs, there's also spatial
separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already mentioned that the
epidermis and specifically dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: the OCl4 transcription factor,
which is preferentially expressed kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: at the North Pole, sort of a limited arc
here on the outer part of each lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the microRNA 2118
predominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the precursor transcripts,
21 FAS, although they're sort of found
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere, including what we think is
artifactual hybridization to the
[SPEAKER_00]: archosporial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dyser 4, the required cleaving enzyme,
is also pretty widely distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure, the product, the 21
nucleotide FASy's, are widely distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think this and other evidence that I'm
not sharing means that the 21 FAS RNAs are
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think they start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're spreading into the rest of the
soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about the 24 nucleotide FASy's?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at an older answer now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the required microRNA for cleaving the
precursor is highly enriched in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tapetum, as are the 24 nucleotide FAS
loci, as is Dyser 5, the required
[SPEAKER_00]: processing enzyme, as are the 24
nucleotide small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's one report here from
Cornell, from Wojtek's lab, and one from
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan, I think, that has evidence that the
now pollen mother cells, or myocytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: contain 24 nucleotide FASy RNAs,
potentially at a low level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find, unfortunately, that any in
situ probe we put on, especially this
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of anther, sticks to the callous
coat that surrounds the myocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very unsatisfying in terms of
knowing whether it's true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, in a separate study that I'm not
talking about today, a postdoc in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: has purified archosporial cells,
PMC, and myocytes for single RNAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and finds neither the FAS precursors nor
Dyser 5 in those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it remains an open question,
if the FASy RNAs are there, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably imported from the tapetum rather
than made in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, in addition to
spatiotemporal separation, the two classes
[SPEAKER_00]: of FASy RNAs are independently regulated
genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already pointed out that OCl4 is
required to make the 21 nucleotide FASy's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the microRNA level are greatly
reduced, the FASy's are virtually gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost all the precursors are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pattern of 24 nucleotide FASy
biogenesis is basically normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite is true for MISCA1,
which basically never gets started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have a tapetum.
[SPEAKER_00]: MAC1 lacks a tapetum, and MS23 has a very
defective tapetum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all making the 21 nucleotide FASy
RNAs, which are characteristic of very
[SPEAKER_00]: early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're failing to make the 24
nucleotide FASy's.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microRNA 2275 is made in MS23 mutants,
but it's from a different locus,
[SPEAKER_00]: two different loci than is represented
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's activation of alternative loci,
but there's no precursor to process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basically no FASy's produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Amyotic1, which is a mutant that fails
to do a correct meiosis, it does mitosis
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of meiosis in these pollen mother
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has both relatively normal 21 and 24
nucleotide RNAs, suggesting that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not like stimulators of meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it may have crossed your mind
since I'm amazed geneticists, and we tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be kind of narrow minded that maybe
we've found something that's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: may-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seminar at this point used to talk
about POA and how special the grasses
[SPEAKER_00]: were, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of smart students in Mike
Meyer's lab, our collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to check non-grass monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a paper has just come out in Genome
for asparagus, lily, daylily, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: other non-grass monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have reproductive FASy RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also, another person in Blake's lab
found their presence sporadically in
[SPEAKER_00]: different families of dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an expert on lychee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, who would go choose that tree to do
the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out it's easy to get anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, the reproductive FASy's
were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was followed by collaborators who
supplied strawberry, tomato, and a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other dicot anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry to report, the one family where
there's a zip is the Brassicaeae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So erbidopsis is not a model for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some other major families
where they're extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another place where we should
think about these male-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive small RNAs are the pie RNAs
that are found in male intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are absolutely required for
successful sperm production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, just like plants,
there's two size classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is made before meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is made during meiosis, but not in the
germinal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the supporting cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no known functions because they
don't match messenger RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like convergent evolution to
aid male reproduction in the mammals and
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering plants, something I find
very odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is also interesting is we've worked
out the biogenesis mechanisms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: poaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different biogenesis
mechanisms in the non-grass monocots and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dicots and in the mammalian pie
RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although you end up with the same types
of small RNA products superabundant at
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific times in male reproduction,
they're not made in exactly the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now I'd like to talk in more detail
about the 24 nucleotide asses and
[SPEAKER_00]: something about the tapetum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tapetum is, oops, now it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oop, now it's really bad, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good with integrating tiny,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tapetal cell development, we've
demonstrated that it's controlled by a
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade of basic helix loop helix
transcription factors, starting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: master regulator male sterile 23,
which acts actually in the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: parietal cells, and it's important for
achieving the correct periclinal division
[SPEAKER_00]: and steps after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's underappreciated is that
tapetal cells are born and perform a suite
[SPEAKER_00]: of functions and then during meiosis,
they have to re-differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're differentiated before meiosis
to do one set of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they re-differentiate for functions
late in meiosis and add even more
[SPEAKER_00]: functions to support immunophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this cell re-differentiation
seems to require the 24 nucleotide asses
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starting with MS23, it's a master
regulator of the tapetum and also is the
[SPEAKER_00]: master regulator of 24 nucleotide FASI RNA
biogenesis, and it acts in part through
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating these other VHLHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the production of the correct microRNA,
the precursors, the dicer, all depend on
[SPEAKER_00]: MS23.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, among these various players,
many of them are redundant or partially
[SPEAKER_00]: redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four loci encoding microRNA
2275, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of different argonauts,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that was a single copy gene
was dicer V.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to use CRISPR-Cas9 to
mutate this singular gene and find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what would happen to development of the
anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a honking big gene, and we
recovered numerous mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those not working on Mase,
what's really great about Mase is when we
[SPEAKER_00]: do the transformation, it's of a single
cell of an embryo in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that the CRISPR-Cas9 system
acts in that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than 95% of the plants that are
regenerated are bioallelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have mutations in both alleles,
independent mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's easy to recover lots of
different alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've characterized carefully four of
those alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, thank goodness for this, even in the
T0, those first initial plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dicer V plants are male sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean clear male sterility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a tassel looks like that has
anthers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a heterozygote of the dicer V-1
allele with the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a homozygote dicer V-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the stage when lots of anthers
are out on this tassel, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: out in this tassel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dicer V is absolutely required to
produce the 24 nucleotide basi RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you that data in a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all of our early studies,
the mutations in dicer V conferred male
[SPEAKER_00]: sterility under field or greenhouse
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from tapetal re-differentiation
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the tapetal cells are there,
and they've done some measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, but they fail to
re-differentiate as secretory cells during
[SPEAKER_00]: meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the demonstration that the 24
nucleotide phases, which are extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant at 1.5 and even more abundant at
2 millimeters, are almost completely gone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you that there's a couple
of the phasloci that slightly overlap with
[SPEAKER_00]: protein coding genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the severe mutants, basically
what you're seeing is some small RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: production from the protein coding genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 12 nucleotide deletion,
so four amino acids, and it's a very low
[SPEAKER_00]: function allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also important, the dicer V mutation,
as expected, selectively blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of 24 nucleotide phases and
doesn't influence the 21 nucleotide phase
[SPEAKER_00]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't influence other types of 24
nucleotide small RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically only orange is super
depressed or missing, and the other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of small RNA are normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not showing you all the
data for this, but in these mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the phas precursors accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the loci, in this case, about 170 loci
are still copiously transcribed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those mRNA-like molecules accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no processing,
and that's what you'd expect for a
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor product relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so obviously we love to look at
anthers with a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in looking at the dicer V mutant at
key stages, from the somatic specification
[SPEAKER_00]: stage through pollen mother cell and
stages of meiosis, the architecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, the cellular anatomy was
indistinguishable between the dicer V
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant and controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could not find any defect in the
pace or pattern of cell division in the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the cells, in the number of cells,
just seemed the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not experts at meiosis,
but this was done by Han Zhang,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a graduate student in Kelly Daw's
lab, where she did learn how to do all the
[SPEAKER_00]: meiotic staging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, meiosis appeared to be
completely normal in the dicer V mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at a male sterile,
and we're wondering, like, what the heck
[SPEAKER_00]: is wrong with these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they male sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to kind of return to what goes
on in the tapetum from birth into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: its specific jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an anther at about 550 microns,
each lobe has 600 secondary parietal
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you label with EDU, which is a T
analog, it's incorporated into DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later, you use click-it chemistry
to attach a fluorescent label to the EDU
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that have been incorporated into
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the secondary parietal layer is
basically these green dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So approximately half of the secondary
parietal cells will label in a two-hour
[SPEAKER_00]: EDU incubation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not synchronous, but they're,
at this stage, lots of the cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ready to do that very important
periclinal division that makes the tapetum
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you chart that,
you see that the division, at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred we use, is completely symmetric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final volume of the two cell types
and each of their dimensions are
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a periclinal division that's
perfect, is the term used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes two equivalent cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now we've made the tapetal cells
back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their first key job after a period of
rapid proliferation for a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: is they secrete the callase that remodels
the callose that's been secreted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen mother cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pollen mother cells secrete excess
callose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lumpy and weird looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the callase causes it to be a smooth
coat that encases each pollen mother cell
[SPEAKER_00]: in a shell, kind of like an M&M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then during meiosis, the tapetal cells
begin to synthesize the components of the
[SPEAKER_00]: exine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the sporophytic compounds
that end up being placed on pollen as it
[SPEAKER_00]: develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weirdly, the tapetal cells also become
binucleate, which is a feature in almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all angiosperms that has no explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just be polyploid?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they've got to have two nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also remodel the wall that faces
the developing myocytes and subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: microgammetophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wall remodeling is extremely
important for secretion, because at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of meiosis, they begin to secrete
these things that they've been making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that through this super
elaborate plasma membrane that perforates
[SPEAKER_00]: a wall that's now mostly dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they do one last thing for the
anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: About five days later, a few days later,
they die, programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the collapse of the remaining tapetal
wall makes something that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: biological Velcro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each developing microgammetophyte needs
to find a place on this biological Velcro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is found in about 10% of
angiosperms where the microgammetophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: need to attach to the dead tapetal wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like musical chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't find a spot, if you're left
in here, you stop developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an absolute requirement to get
viable pollen that each and every one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these microgammetophytes get to one of
these tapetal landing pads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, or I hope I've convinced
you, that the pedum isn't just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to say it's a nutritive layer kind of
overlooks the sequential jobs that it
[SPEAKER_00]: performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gave us a lot of characters that we
could use to judge what's wrong in those
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicer V mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by transmission EM, here's wild pipe,
we see that the tapetal cells have two
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see nuclei typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really dark staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filled with exine components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the Dicer V mutants are very pale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not making exine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also very clear, this is a
special kind of microscopy analysis called
[SPEAKER_00]: 3D segmentation, where yellow represents
binucleate cells and purple mononucleate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more binucleate cells at
various stages, one and a half for 2.5
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter in wild type than in the
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears that the Dicer V mutant
tapetal cells are failing to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-differentiate in a timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some make it, some make binucleate cells,
which is one of the last steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be accumulating a small amount
of exine, but they're not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're either delayed or arrested
in some aspect of their developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did one more experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always the killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were writing all of this up and we
said, well, you know, we always grow
[SPEAKER_00]: everything under really hot conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's corn after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a low temperature experiment and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the big surprise is that the Dicer V
mutants are restored to partial or even
[SPEAKER_00]: full fertility when grown under cool
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to tell you that we were growing
under what's considered optimal corn yield
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's huge historical data that says you
get maximum corn yield with 28 to 29
[SPEAKER_00]: centigrade days and 22 degree centigrade
nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, these are restrictive conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely require Dicer V to be
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go under cool growing conditions,
Dicer V is dispensable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's mutant pollen from the cool
growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the control pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have self pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's in warm growing conditions,
night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the period of meiosis when we made
sure that the temperature was really high
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can get sterile plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we lower the temperature to 26 or 23,
we get fertility, at least partial
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it turns out that the cool growing
conditions do not restore the 24
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dicer V is not being made under cool
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the ancient duplication
parent gene, Dicer III, which is found in
[SPEAKER_00]: all flowering plants, can't substitute for
Dicer V in making the 24 nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's dispensable are the FASI RNAs,
not just Dicer V.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need FASI RNAs for fertility if
you grow the plants in unusually cool
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a long series of temperature
shift experiments in three day increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very complicated slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange area is the period of meiosis
and we were shifting plants between 21 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 degrees and 28 and then back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that I need to tell you
that a developing maize tassel has about
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days worth of anther development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get a fully fertile tassel where
all of the anthers come out, you need our
[SPEAKER_00]: nine day treatment, six or nine day
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for any given cohort of anthers that
are of a similar stage, you only need
[SPEAKER_00]: three days, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a phenocritical period during
meiosis, during the period when the
[SPEAKER_00]: tapetal cells begin their
re-differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they either need the FASI 24
nucleotide RNAs or they need cool
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what else does cool conditions do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really slows down development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meiosis is now going to take 12 or 13
days instead of six or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also means the tapetal cells have
a lot longer time to do whatever they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do to re-differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's get to the conclusions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we say about whether 21
nucleotide FASI RNAs are required for
[SPEAKER_00]: maize anther development?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we eliminate them genetically,
and now we've eliminated them by mutating
[SPEAKER_00]: microRNA 2118, we fail to get normal
somatic development and this causes meal
[SPEAKER_00]: stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can say it's possible that the
mobile signal under the control of OCL4 is
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact the FASI RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the hypothesis that we're
trying to test now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This green arrow points to the part of
each anther lobe that seems to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important area for the expression of OCL4
for microRNA 2118 and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: biogenesis factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there's no meristem, maybe this
is a kind of signaling center in that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got information from here and it
spreads through the lobe and helps
[SPEAKER_00]: organize the development of the soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the 24 nucleotide RNAs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we eliminate Dicer5 under normal
growing conditions and hence eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 nucleotide FASI RNAs, we get meal
stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems to be not stability from some
defect in meiosis, but from this important
[SPEAKER_00]: tapetal cell re-differentiation which
seems contingent under normal growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions on the presence of the 24
nucleotide FASIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of left with the hypothesis
that in some way 24 nucleotide FASI RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: aid rapid reorganization of tapetal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under normal growing conditions the
tapetal cells need to do things bang,
[SPEAKER_00]: bang, bang over a day, two, maybe three,
and that that is helped by having 24
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide FASI RNAs present.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you slow everything down,
then more or less successfully the tapetal
[SPEAKER_00]: cells can reorganize themselves using a
different pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this leads exactly into my last slide,
which is we have yet to pop the cork on
[SPEAKER_00]: this champagne because of course the most
important thing to figure out is what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the functions, the exact functions of
these small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be acting in some unexpected
way as signals for cell fate and
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there's many, many examples of
individuals micro RNAs acting at critical
[SPEAKER_00]: junctures to guide or program
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you need 440 21 nucleotide loci?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why 170 that make 24 nucleotide FASIs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're signals, they're
individually pretty crummy at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need zillions of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have cytoplasmic or nuclear
roles or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty convinced now they're made in
the cytoplasm, but they're not probably
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted to that compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our sort of current working
model, I've nicknamed the FLAC hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has also been suggested by some
people that work on mammalian pi RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you accept that small RNA metabolism is
critical for cell differentiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: then disrupting it by putting out a huge
number of non-functional small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could disrupt everything about small RNA
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might allow for making a clean
slate, like when a cell needs to change
[SPEAKER_00]: from one state to another, like from a
primary parietal cell to an endothelial
[SPEAKER_00]: and secondary parietal cell, or when the
tapetal cells need to re-differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have them, maybe there's a
workaround, like the decay of the FASI
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs and eventually the regular systems
take over and micro RNAs can do their
[SPEAKER_00]: normal job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I realize that's not a super
satisfying final hypothesis, but it's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working on now with new methods to
knock out not just one or two FAS loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: but dozens, if not hundreds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then it wouldn't be a good
seminar if I didn't acknowledge the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who actually did the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my lab, there's a number of
postdoctoral fellows who have contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus John Fernandez, a bioinformatician,
and then former members of the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Karina Benderlinda developed the
Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various other people worked on aspects of
the talk I gave today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the past five years, and now
continuing for four more, we're generously
[SPEAKER_00]: supported by the NSF in a collaboration
with Blake Meyer's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: His lab is expert on small RNA sequencing
and analysis, so I have to say we do a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the biology, they do all the
sequencing, and together we try to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what's going on in these answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that great talk, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a little short on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's maybe just take two questions,
and if you have more questions afterwards,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can come talk to me afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Jenny, in the DCL5 mutant,
is the tapilla cell really differentiation
[SPEAKER_03]: still defective?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they fertile despite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, they kind of catch up with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the exine is formed on the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the things that you would expect
to come from the tapetum eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, pollen shed, even if it's
only like a six-day period in cool
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, pollen shed will be 10 days later
than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've really extended developmental
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There seem like a lot of parallels between
the pyRNAs and the enamels, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis from clusters, and the fact that
factors needed for biogenesis are leading
[SPEAKER_01]: to male sterility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if in the DCL5 mutant you
have reactivation of mobile elements,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly DNA methylation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on the first, I can say for sure
there appears to be no reactivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true for the Drosophila pies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a subset, about 10% of the
mammalian pie RNAs are associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: some homology to some transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seem not to have that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the DNA methylation front,
we have what I would say is ambiguous data
[SPEAKER_00]: on whole anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a postdoc now is doing laser micro
dissection of tapetal cells, since that
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be where the action is to ask if
the FASI24s can influence the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be technically
challenging, because the binucleate status
[SPEAKER_00]: requires one round of DNA synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not just one nucleus in one
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if there's an old nucleus and a new
one, you might say?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were hemimethylated at the
beginning, maybe you have one cell that
[SPEAKER_00]: retains hemimethylation and one that's
unmethylated, because it's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: unmethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm guessing that this is not going to
be easy to be really definitive on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's her favorite theory, because
classically, 24-nucleotide small RNAs in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are involved in the RNA-directed
DNA methylation pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be something that a lot
more is known about from the non-FASI24
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide class.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think pinning it down here is going
to be tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time when it matters, about 40%,
not quite 40% of all the nuclei in an
[SPEAKER_00]: anther are actually from the tapetum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we have what I would call hint
of success results on whole anthers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not really satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need the purified cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the grad students, please remember
there's lunch in P22.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's thank the speaker again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
