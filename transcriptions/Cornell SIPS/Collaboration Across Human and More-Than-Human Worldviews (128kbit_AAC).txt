[SPEAKER_00]: What an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such exciting discussions,
and I'm humbled to come from here in East
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii Island, very rural communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot about human behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my name is Scott Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a climate adaptation extension
specialist with PyCASC, and I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about human behavior,
and we've talked a little bit about that
[SPEAKER_00]: already in the previous discussions,
you'll see some linkages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought one way to share that is to talk
about my behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the core to my professional path
has always been to be regularly immersed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the natural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal to that has been to develop and
foster genuine connection or meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing that, essentially, I really had
focused on sustenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say that, I mean in remote
locations and deeply connected to the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural world, connecting to our food,
water, shelter basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's heavily linked
ancestrally as well to health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to really center on well-being a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in doing that, I'm going to share
North America and my experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: research and leading outdoor expeditions,
outdoor expeditions there, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transition to where I am now in middle of
the Pacific Ocean and share that
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in a sense of human behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not at all to diminish, to cue into
Sharon's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember acutely when you tear your
ACL.
[SPEAKER_00]: In remote places, you value emergency
rooms and access to them and hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: visits and those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really focusing on well-being that
transcends some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it's more important,
it's just the sense of well-being and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that next as far as connection
and relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Bissau-Combine in the upper left
from the middle of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an individual that I began to learn
very well its stories through
[SPEAKER_00]: dendrochronology and other work that I had
done in this very remote area,
[SPEAKER_00]: treeline, looking into the changes in its
stories or the way it tells its story of
[SPEAKER_00]: change over more than 1,200 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This individual has been alive and it put
me in a place of understanding my place,
[SPEAKER_00]: how small it is and how, for me,
that's where I felt most alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to that connection to nature
and sustenance, I followed it in a human
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior way because it's where I felt
most alive and I'm doing that to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom right, I should say the linkage
from the left to the right is that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best mentors I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Black Lab Mutt, again, linking to
Sharon's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the greatest hunter I've ever known.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom right is my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper right was researching white
pines and the Rockies and then the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: right is in Northwest Wyoming researching
wolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The linkage there, it really was
compelling for me to understand wolves
[SPEAKER_00]: better through my dog, this great friend
of mine, and then vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly in the sense of sustenance of
food and hunting and watching and being,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the winter with wolves,
trained me much more deeply and truly to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect a place, sure, but pragmatically
to find food successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is David Abram wrote a book that was
really powerful in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Spell of the Sensuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was a game changer in literature
of essentially he's saying we are only
[SPEAKER_00]: human in as much as we are connected to
more than human.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if we're not connected to
nature, we're missing our capacity in a
[SPEAKER_00]: psyche sense, the development of our
psyche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going further at that time, this is again,
about 2000s in Northwest Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I was engaging outdoor
education as research in leading short
[SPEAKER_00]: week-long small group expeditions,
but I was also hunting and using my
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical skills with a friend of mine,
a non-blood brother named Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go up into say nine, 10,000 feet
applying our knowledge of ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd start in the low areas, digging
yamper root, going up to a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: berries up elevation in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we transitioned to small game hunting
and deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd stay out there in the sense of not
having refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not packing out anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're preserving the food in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Doug for tea and drinking in the
upper left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is this is bear country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a certain heightened awareness in
Northwest Wyoming when you are doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only was I most alive in these
situations, I saw my own horizons much
[SPEAKER_00]: better in a way of pursuing my
professional development of connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving north in Alaska, again,
the mid-2000s by this point and late
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s, it's the relationships across the
operators in these week-long, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: was two week-long expeditions across
global cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was World Wildlife Funds send their
clientele across all cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would link up in these small groups of
say six to 10 people that we build a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That team was embedded deeply within boat
captains, float planes, and establishing
[SPEAKER_00]: trust there is fundamental because when
things go south and they will,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to be ready and you have to have
open communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean just with the human
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fascinating way to engage human
behavior at more of an extreme as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: furthering North America and latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, the species that I was
used to in Northwest Wyoming were vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different in the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same species, the coastal
grizzly, the coastal brown bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus the grizzlies of Yellowstone,
but they function totally differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm an omnivore and I'm thinking of
sustenance, that's an omnivore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most everything they eat seasonally,
even though it's very different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: interior bears of Alaska or the grizzlies
and Yellowstone, I can eat mostly what
[SPEAKER_00]: they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing connection to reconnect to
in these ways across species in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the human element is where I
found myself most situated in working with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that generationally have been
engaged in these areas was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very rugged cabin of a very
rugged woman connected to places,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody and Lucas from the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Kevin and I, again, with some of
the clothes that we tanned from our
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Peter and Mary, good friends of
mine from Rankin Inlet on Hudson Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Peter in the right doing a drum
dance while Mary is chanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a small structure built of
essentially bearded seal, seal skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to see much more deeply,
not only into generational connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: place and survival, well-being,
et cetera, and adaptation, but they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: to find myself more deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I go further north, again, the bear
ecology totally changes with polar bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vast open expanses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bears, unlike brown bears and black
bears that are gone within nine out of 10
[SPEAKER_00]: times before even though you were in their
area, these bears will come right to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also extremely remote as far as
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need these relationships in place
where you don't have Athabascan interior
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, say in Alaska or across Canada,
all kinds of wood and lots of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's driftwood here, except in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is change is paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the communities change, the more than
human, so do the human and the Dorset
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm missing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dorset culture was one that was used
to heavy ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would hunt and fish from the ice,
hand-lining essentially two ton or one ton
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, marine mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was massive and they were around for
1,500 stable years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the climate shifts around 500 AD,
the medieval warming era, and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: very quick transition to the Tule people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave those upper left ambulance
indicating that throughout that era,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tule being the predecessor of Inuit,
Yupik, Inupiat, and certainly all across
[SPEAKER_00]: coastal communities, but that deep
connection, those are Dorset amulets that
[SPEAKER_00]: are maybe an inch or two hyper accurate
skull structures of polar bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the more stylized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really getting at spiritual realms
and more swimming behaviors and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the Tule take over,
they're using open ocean crafts to harness
[SPEAKER_00]: right whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: These whales are so massive that
stabilizes the seasonality of the Tule
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and from, again, a sustenance
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to quick go through,
there we go, that all those relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I'm in Hawaii in 2010,
I realized very quickly that information
[SPEAKER_00]: data is not knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very quickly, I mean, over that time,
I came to Hawaii understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: information is not knowledge, nor do we
become any more knowledgeable through
[SPEAKER_00]: information accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledgeability rather is situated in
that information within the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: direct perceptual engagements with our
environment, in other words, experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quote from Tim Ingold,
one of the paramount folks in establishing
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental anthropology as a new
discipline currently since basically from
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through that time, if information is not
knowledge, well, what is knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we just talked about that as
situated information through experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how come with all the decades of
applied science and climate science,
[SPEAKER_00]: have we not seen more human behavior
change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, psychologists, cognitive biologists,
and certainly a range of social sciences
[SPEAKER_00]: have said, well, if you want to engage
behavior, engage affect, emotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're getting at is the type one
and two knowledge forms or knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type one is visceral, quick acting,
very impactful, instinct, intuition,
[SPEAKER_00]: emotion, unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thinking about hunting and fishing,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system too is that long-term slower to
react reason, logic, analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not saying one is better than the
other, but it is saying most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research suggests if these two diverge in
one person, the visceral knowledge forms
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to dominate behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that we need them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is not thinking of climate
change as some distant future or vast
[SPEAKER_00]: geography and objectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really shifting social sciences have
made clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about climate change as
deeply personal, deeply local,
[SPEAKER_00]: and deeply present in this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, I had developed with a number of
leaders, co-developed the Manager Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Corps, which is a research program for
graduate students where they get two-year
[SPEAKER_00]: immersions into community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by community is I had worked
hard to find the long-term relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to place in East Hawaii and
Hawaii Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is people who are cultural
practitioners, heritage managers,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural resource managers, policy
professionals who are deeply connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: not only the more than human place,
but also the communities of humans that
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize and engage that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I show these foundational elements of
the Manager Climate Corps program,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, they make sense a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really need to go through them as
you think about the slides I've shared in
[SPEAKER_00]: my path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had 20 grad students go through this
over five cohorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a hugely engaging way to drop
graduate students into long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships through practitioners of
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see in the website that we're
linked, those websites will show you about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Manager Climate Corps in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to shift to the same
foundations of that program that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: going on for the last 10 years and show
those same foundations applied in new
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, into new locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kealakekua on the West Hawaii
Island is known more so globally now as
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those top coral reefs, snorkel
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of those folks engaging in the
reef understand the huge power of that
[SPEAKER_00]: area as far as the Native Hawaiian history
and contemporary culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Hikiau He'au from the late 18th
century in the artist rendition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice there in that He'au or sacred
place, sacred structure has been
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional practice has gone on from then
to the present moment without
[SPEAKER_00]: interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about sustenance,
connection to food, water, shelter,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly within more than human,
what a great place to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community action plan that was
developed was driven by traditional that
[SPEAKER_00]: community itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was embedded into the state parks
top-down more conventional plan to really
[SPEAKER_00]: join those two to have at the same time,
a community driven plan united with a
[SPEAKER_00]: state parks plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first kind of that, sort that has been
established in Hawaii, the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, relationality or kinship
modalities is the only cross-cutting theme
[SPEAKER_00]: of that community action plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to think of it is the goal
here is to root the practices in Hikiau He
[SPEAKER_00]: 'au that again, as far as relationality or
kinship have been handed down for
[SPEAKER_00]: generations and root them much more deeply
in all the surrounding activities,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's tourism experience,
industries, certainly research that has
[SPEAKER_00]: largely been parachuted in and not really
engaging the community, shifting all as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can patiently, slowly to engage heritage
management, to engage natural resource
[SPEAKER_00]: management through those very specific
practices in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new five-year program that's
being developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, we're in our first year with
that, partnering with Cornell for that
[SPEAKER_00]: from UH.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example of a practice in the area,
and of course, Pacific-wide and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: globally, this outrigger canoe paddling is
a powerful way to demonstrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an introduction to outrigger canoe
paddling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been handed down for generations
to obtain sustenance, to survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's fishing, hunting,
adaptation as far as war, transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are basics that have come down
through generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, many spatial scales and temporal
scales are engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're talking about ground swells
impacting the canoe, how to navigate that
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time as windchop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we take that notion of practice to
a broader scale, back to that manager
[SPEAKER_00]: climate core again, those are two-year
research projects that graduate students
[SPEAKER_00]: were driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if each of the islands here are
stages or research projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first five there that are darker,
those could be each a research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're maintaining the relationships as
embodied in the canoe itself, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: navigators within the canoe, that final
island, the sixth island is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: engage, for example, through Kila Kikua
Bay, the community action plan I shared,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep kinship connection, and therein the
capacity for gaining local sustenance,
[SPEAKER_00]: food, water, shelter, but also a way to
adapt that's been intact for centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't consider those tremendous
capacities just in the human condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're missing a lot of what it is to not
only adapt, but actually to find our
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper sense of self, our wellbeing,
and certainly health as far as our ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for your time,
and that's what I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious, and Sharon, hop on when
you're ready for your concluding
[SPEAKER_01]: statements, but I'm just curious,
Scott, you're taking in this relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: and relationality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very organic relationality,
and one that I personally can understand
[SPEAKER_01]: or relate to, but we are entering into
this incredible abstract moment of
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial intelligence, which is still
two degrees of separation from whoever
[SPEAKER_01]: generated the basis for which the AI is
going at, but how are you thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporating or informing that trajectory
in that direction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to sort of integrate this
massive ecosystem thinking, corporeal
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, with these database AI-based
formulas for understanding the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: picture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different ways, and I'm just
curious how you're thinking about how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can...
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to give an example of how I didn't
mention too much of the research I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in and have been for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't focus on that as much as engaging
that research and largely in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's one of the things I'd say
is, you know, I'm talking about remote
[SPEAKER_00]: wilderness experience, sustenance,
and building shelter in that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no less is this applied with local
sustenance in a garden, in a backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: garden or front yard garden, and the more
that we're in it, engaging the senses,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in a sense, as I mentioned with David
Abrams' Spell of the Sensuous,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just as paramount, and particularly
when global supply chains are in question
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're talking about massively
unsustainable connectivity globally in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to carbon budgets, and it's a
natural to maintain those pathways to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect to place more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean, you know, that I know
where this shirt was made from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I tried to make clothing to grow food
or to wild harvest food, and the more that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing that, like David Abrams would
suggest that the more we're capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: finding our own well-being, our own sense
of self, instinctively, that's been handed
[SPEAKER_00]: down for centuries to all cultures,
all people, and that's kind of what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been on the path of, and that's what I
sort of answer with is just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the things going on, none of that
negates the need to connect to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it only emphasizes it in my
brain, my zone, and it doesn't suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that we shouldn't consider these large
technologies, but as Sharon presented,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are costs to a lot of these,
whether it's AI, she mentioned some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think of all the spectrum of
impacts in plus and minus ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically towards sustainability of all
species, not just our own, and the more we
[SPEAKER_00]: consider that, the less we're not centered
on humans, the more I find that we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: become truly human.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
