[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Olena.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the opportunity to tell you
about some of my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to start with a full
disclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very, very basic plant scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do much of applied work,
but I hope that my today's presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: will convince you that basic science can
drive applied research down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the discoveries that we're making in
everyday lab experiments eventually will
[SPEAKER_00]: be translated into something that's useful
to humanity in terms of better crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a plant biologist, I'm interested in a
very simple question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes plants successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is the plants are
sessile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot escape bad environmental
conditions, and they're forced to stay and
[SPEAKER_00]: endure pretty much everything that the
nature throws at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would like to understand at the
molecular level is how plants are capable
[SPEAKER_00]: of adapting to a variety of environmental
factors, both abiotic and biotic nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and produce appropriate responses that
enable plants to coordinate their growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and development with their environment and
basically survive in hostile conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming increasingly clear that
plant hormones play a key role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: signal integration process between
environment and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, my research has been
focused on two plant hormones,
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main goal of my career at this
point is to understand not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual pathways, how oxygen is
produced, perceived, and how plant
[SPEAKER_00]: transduces a signal of oxygen,
same thing for ethylene, but also how the
[SPEAKER_00]: two hormones coordinate their signaling
pathways with one another to enable the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to adapt to various environmental
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this audience, I probably don't need to
emphasize the key role of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's important to probably just notice
that oxygen is involved in everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: from embryogenesis to organ senescence and
abscission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, ethylene is involved in many
different processes, starting with seed
[SPEAKER_00]: germination all the way to fruit ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between ethylene and
oxygen is quite complex, however.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they co-regulate many of the
same processes, it's not fully understood
[SPEAKER_00]: how the two interact with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide shows the phenotypes of the
Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the dark in
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of either hormone ethylene or
its precursor, ACC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be referring to ACC on multiple
occasions in my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, it's a precursor to
ethylene that plant can readily convert
[SPEAKER_00]: into ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a phenotype of a three-day-old,
dark-grown etiolated seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure Jan Hwasing, oh, I remember
that phenotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she used to work on ethylene as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenotype is commonly referred to as
the triple response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's characterized by shortening and
thickening of the hypochotelin root and
[SPEAKER_00]: exaggeration of the apical hook curvature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the way the wild-type plant
behaves in the presence of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classical ethylene mutants, such as IN2
and IN3, that are defective in the signal
[SPEAKER_00]: transducer production pathway,
are unable to perceive, or actually unable
[SPEAKER_00]: to respond to ethylene and show resistance
to this hormone, both in the hypochotles
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the root tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's remarkable, however, that auxin
mutants, such as an auxin transport mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: aux1, auxin response mutant axr1,
are also defective in their response to
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their abnormal response is limited to
root tissues only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypochotles and the apical hooks are
pretty much indistinguishable in their
[SPEAKER_00]: response from wild-type, but the roots are
insensitive to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests that certain levels of auxin
signaling, auxin transport, auxin
[SPEAKER_00]: response, are absolutely necessary for the
plants to be able to fully respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set out to try to understand the
relationships between the ethylene pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: and the auxin pathway, how the two
pathways interact to coordinate or
[SPEAKER_00]: co-ordinately regulate cell growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: By training, I'm a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main approach is classical forward
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already noted to you in the
previous slides that ethylene mutants are
[SPEAKER_00]: defective in their response to ethylene,
both in the hypochotles and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypochotles are just embryonic stems of
Arabidopsis seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they respond normally to auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classical auxin mutants, on the other
hand, in addition to being insensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: auxin, have a root-specific ethylene
defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided that if we were to look for
mutants that are defective in the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between ethylene and auxin or
crosstalk mutants, we should be focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the phenotypes that are intermediate
between those of classical ethylene and
[SPEAKER_00]: classical auxin mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first class of mutants that we
characterized was this class one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We refer to it as WEI mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: WEI stands for weak ethylene insensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these mutants are phenotypically
intermediate between ethylene and auxin
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants in the sense that they do not have
any auxin defects, but have root-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene insensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my postdoctoral work, I actually
focused on the characterization of these
[SPEAKER_00]: WEI mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is long published, so I won't
talk about this topic today, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: state that through the work on the WEI
mutants, we were able to demonstrate that
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene can induce auxin biosynthesis by
upregulating the transcription of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate-limiting enzymes of auxin
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this local boost in auxin production
is what drives inhibition of cell growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to talk about today is
our more recent work on the second class
[SPEAKER_00]: of integration mutants that are
phenotypically quite similar to class one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this UPF mutants do not have anything
to do with auxin biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are UPFs?
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'll tell you that we have done
many different mutant screens and
[SPEAKER_00]: identified multiple alleles of each of the
three UPF genes that fall into three
[SPEAKER_00]: complementation groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them share similar phenotype in
the sense that roots are partially
[SPEAKER_00]: insensitive to ethylene, but the
hypercodals are more or less normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: respond similarly to wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UPFs are part of the so-called nonce
mediated decay pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a surveillance mechanism that detects
mRNAs, transcripts, that contain premature
[SPEAKER_00]: termination codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, have long three prime
UTRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if a cell, with the help
of this NMD machinery, nonce mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: decay machinery, detects a transcript with
a premature termination codon?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two possible outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is translational inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that transcripts get
targeted to P-bodies, which are processing
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies or components.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the components within the
cytoplasm predominantly that store and or
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade abnormal transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another potential outcome, other than
the storage, is transcript degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually induced through either
endoneuclide cleavage or deadenylation and
[SPEAKER_00]: decapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if there is a transcript that
has an early termination codon,
[SPEAKER_00]: this transcript is either going to be
stored nonproductively without being
[SPEAKER_00]: translated or outright degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand the role of UPF genes in
plants, in mRNA surveillance, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: in regulation of translation, we decided
to implement a protocol to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of translation at a global
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just around the time when we were planning
this experiment, a new protocol came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: known as ribosome for printing or Riboseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that technology, I will show you in a
second how exactly it works, allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a glimpse at protein levels,
actually not the exact levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually the levels of translation or
translation efficiency of the genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, pretty much of any gene that is
being transcribed in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it enables us to tell if a transcript
is present in the cell, does it get
[SPEAKER_00]: translated, or is it just being stored
nonproductively?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we performed this experiment both in
wild type and in the UPF mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a mutant that we identified as a component
of this class two of the integration
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did in parallel riboseq or ribosome
for printing and RNAseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you know what RNAseq is about,
but only some of you have heard of the
[SPEAKER_00]: riboseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of the riboseq is actually
very brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if instead of looking at the total
RNAs in the cell, we specifically focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs that are being translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be translated, a transcript gets
bound by the ribosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if we purify only transcripts that
are associated with the ribosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called polysomal RNAs, and we focus on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will take those transcripts,
and we're going to digest these
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts that are bound with the
ribosomes with an RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs is an endonuclease that's going to
chew up all the exposed parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript, whereas small, tiny footprints
that are shielded or protected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribosomes stay undegraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those footprints can then be converted
into sequencing libraries and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do this side by side with the
traditional RNAseq, where you just shear
[SPEAKER_00]: longer transcripts into small fragments
and then ligate adapters and then sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: in parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by doing riboseq and RNAseq in
parallel, we're able to judge how actively
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific gene of interest is being
translated in a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because having an RNA made doesn't
necessarily mean that this RNA is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be necessarily synthesized into or
converted into a protein translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this method, this riboseq method,
allows us to look at the whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, at every single gene that's being
transcribed, in terms of how well it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives us unprecedented level of
precision at a single codon resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first thing we did is we
looked at the full change in the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of ethylene that we see in our RNAseq data
and in our riboseq data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expectation is that the more RNA you
have in the cell, the more protein you
[SPEAKER_00]: will synthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you expect a decent level of
correlation between the full change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript of buttons and the full change
in the footprint of buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually that surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the R squared value was only 0.22,
suggesting only very limited level of
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between RNA data and footprint
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is telling us that there's a lot of
regulation happening at the level after
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcript has been made, at the
post-transcriptional level, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: at the level of translation in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the stringency of our
cutoff, if we look for genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially regulated by ethylene at
the level of translation, we get anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from five genes to several hundred genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how stringent our method is,
we always get the same two genes come up
[SPEAKER_00]: as the most stringently regulated by
ethylene at the level of translation,
[SPEAKER_00]: EBF-1 and EBF-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: A gene known as EBF-1, and I'll tell you
in a second what it does, is not regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: by ethylene at the level of transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at how the reads map in
the RNAseq data, and this is the riboseq
[SPEAKER_00]: data or footprint data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene is not regulated by ethylene
at the level of transcript, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: repressed at the translational level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see fewer reads mapping here than we
see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is EBF-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: For EBF-2, we see actually transcriptional
induction from here to here at the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of RNAseq data, but in the footprint data
or in the riboseq, we actually see the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both cases, the translational
efficiency in ethylene is only about 40%
[SPEAKER_00]: of that in error.
[SPEAKER_00]: This TE stands for translational
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done with comparing riboseq and
RNAseq data, but we can also confirm this
[SPEAKER_00]: finding using alternative method.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, using QRT-PCR, validation of
genes of interest, comparing total versus
[SPEAKER_00]: polysomal RNA abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically for EBF-1 and EBF-2,
we see about 40% to 50% translational
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of those two genes in ethylene
compared to that in error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are EBFs?
[SPEAKER_00]: EBFs, turns out, are critical components
of the ethylene single transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So EBFs, shown here in blue color,
are F-box proteins that target the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional master regulators of
ethylene signaling, IN3 and IL-1,
[SPEAKER_00]: for degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the absence of ethylene, EBFs would
degrade IN3 and IL-1 via 26S proteasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is no IN3 and IL-1 remaining
in the cell, then ethylene responses are
[SPEAKER_00]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of EBFs as negative regulators of
the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will become important later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try to understand which features
within EBF-1, and EBF-2 RNAs are required
[SPEAKER_00]: for this translational regulation by
ethylene, we looked at the structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what stands out is the unusually long
3-prime UTRs in both cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: An average Arabidopsis 3-prime
untranslated region is about 215
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides long or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the length of the 3-prime
UTRs is 640 and 594 nucleotides long,
[SPEAKER_00]: so more than double of the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided to do is focus,
at least at the beginning, on these
[SPEAKER_00]: 3-prime UTRs and see if the 3-prime UTRs
by themselves have any effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: translational regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a very simple idea of just
hooking up the 3-prime UTR of EBF-2,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, to a GFP reporter driven by
the constitutive 35S promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our control, we used nopulin synthase,
or NOS terminator, that people typically
[SPEAKER_00]: use in many of the different types of
transgenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as expected, the classical NOS
terminator construct had no difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: its expression between controlling media
and media supplemented with the ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor ACC, whereas all of the lines
that we generated for the EBF-2 reporter
[SPEAKER_00]: showed dramatic reduction in the
translation efficiency between control
[SPEAKER_00]: media and media supplemented with ACC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you that it's translation
efficiency, but by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence, you don't know if it's RNA
levels or protein levels that are
[SPEAKER_00]: different between air and ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, we needed to look and
convince ourselves it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look by QRTPCR at the level of
RNA, there was no significant difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between how actively a transcript
accumulates in control media or in ACC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw pretty much the same patterns for
the NOS lines and for the 3-prime or EBF-2
[SPEAKER_00]: gene lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see, however, is at the protein
level detected by Western, in the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of ethylene, the GFP protein doesn't
accumulate or accumulate to significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: lower levels than in the control
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that it's not the
transcript abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually protein synthesis that's
being compromised in the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene in the lines that harbor this
3-prime UTR of the EBF-2 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another remarkable finding in our
opinion is the fact that this 3-prime UTR
[SPEAKER_00]: of EBF-2 is absolutely required for the
normal response of plants to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is seen from this experiment
where we are taking genomic construct of
[SPEAKER_00]: EBF-2 and replacing the terminator,
the native EBF-2 terminator, with a
[SPEAKER_00]: classical NOS terminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants become completely
insensitive to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take a native construct that has
normally EBF-2 to 3-prime UTR,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants respond perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: So without knowing much about ethylene,
you can say, oh, maybe the constructs are
[SPEAKER_00]: just being silenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the case, because if you have a
silencing of EBF-2 gene, you would expect
[SPEAKER_00]: a hypersensitive response to ethylene,
not an insensitive response, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a negative regulator of the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then another possibility, well,
maybe this EBF-2 construct that contains
[SPEAKER_00]: NOS terminators may be simply it
accumulates to higher levels than does the
[SPEAKER_00]: native construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, the ethylene-insensitive
plants that have this NOS terminator
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate to lower levels overall than
the lines that have the EBF-2 terminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the RNA levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out that this 3-prime UTR of EBF-2
is driving this translational repression
[SPEAKER_00]: in the presence of ethylene, air ethylene,
air ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the NOS terminator, of course,
cannot do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that the 3-prime UTR
of this gene is required for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene-mediated regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we replace 3-prime of EBF-2 by the NOS
terminator, this ethylene-mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you that it's sufficient,
this 3-prime UTR, that it's required for
[SPEAKER_00]: the ethylene response, and that it's also
required for ethylene-mediated regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the question that we wanted to
address next is to try to shed light
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanistically where in the pathway this
translational regulation takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll walk you through the ethylene pathway
in a couple of slides from now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I want to show you here is we
wanted to try to see where in the pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: this translational regulation works.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, which of the components,
of the known components of the pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: are required for this translational
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the next experiment, I will show
you the experiment that focuses on IN2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: IN3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we introduced this
EBF-2-prime, or 3-prime containing a
[SPEAKER_00]: repression, reporter into two mutant
backgrounds, IN2 and IN3-IL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, IN2 is this component of the
pathway, and IN3-IL1 are the next known
[SPEAKER_00]: component of the pathway in the sequence
of the events in the ethylene signal
[SPEAKER_00]: transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We utilized silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver is an inhibitor of ethylene
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants that are treated with silver
become essentially ethylene-insensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You negate the effect of ethylene because
you block the receptor activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we have to use silver is
because ion mutants, such as IN2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: IN3-IL1, are known to accumulate much
higher levels of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are insensitive to ethylene
are trying to overcompensate by
[SPEAKER_00]: overproducing ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to negate the effects of this
endogenous ethylene, we're using silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see is that in the IN3-IL1
double mutant, either endogenous ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: in the control conditions or exogenous
ethylene in ACC-treated plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: completely diminish the expression of the
GFP reporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not occur in the IN2.
[SPEAKER_00]: IN2 plants maintain their GFP expression
independently of the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is telling us is that IN2 is
required for the translational regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: by ethylene, and IN3 and IL1 are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We confirm this finding using QRT-PCR on
the polysomal versus total RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see that IN3-IL1 behaves in the
same manner as does wild-type plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas IN2 mutants are insensitive to
ethylene and cannot be repressed by
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene at the level of translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this very simple experiment enabled us
to position this translational regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: step of the pathway between IN2 and IN3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to walk you through the
pathway so that you would appreciate what
[SPEAKER_00]: that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the absence of ethylene,
IN2, that is a transmembrane protein that
[SPEAKER_00]: sits in the endoplasmic reticulum,
is inactivated via phosphorylation by
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called rat-like kinase CTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IN2 is inactive sits in the membrane if
there's no ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's ethylene in the environment,
shown here as red dots, ethylene will bind
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ethylene receptors, and the
receptors get shut down by binding of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the absence of active receptors,
CTR is inactive, CTR1 kinase can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylate IN2, and then IN2 gets
reactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And upon IN2 reactivation, a very
interesting phenomenon happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see terminal end of IN2 by an unknown
mechanism gets cleaved off and can travel
[SPEAKER_00]: to the nucleus where it activates
transcription of ethylene-responsive
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So according to this model, the C-termins
of IN2 should be nucleolocalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: not working somewhere in the cytoplasm
where translation is known to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to that point of view in a
minute, but for now what I want to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you, if we want to figure out where
exactly the translation regulation steps
[SPEAKER_00]: take place, we don't really have much room
to wiggle because these are the only two
[SPEAKER_00]: components we know in between,
and we know IN2 is required, IN3 is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, out of not having better option,
what we decided to do is just check if IN2
[SPEAKER_00]: itself can regulate translation of EBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first approach that we took was
using yeast 3 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you have heard of yeast 2 hybrid
that allows you to test binding between
[SPEAKER_00]: two proteins of interest, protein X,
protein Y, and if the two proteins bind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will get reconstitution of a
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, gal 4 activation domain
comes in close proximity of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get activation of a reporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yeast 3 hybrid system is very similar
except that the interaction between the
[SPEAKER_00]: gal 4 activation hybrid, gal 4 activation
domain hybrid, and the DNA binding
[SPEAKER_00]: activation domain hybrid is indirect and
occurs through an RNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because this interaction is indirect,
it allows you to test for the binding or
[SPEAKER_00]: physical interaction between the protein
of interest in this case, IN2,
[SPEAKER_00]: fused to the gal 4 activation domain,
and an RNA of interest, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 3 prime untranslated region of EBF2
that is fused to so-called MS2 binding
[SPEAKER_00]: site, which is a specific element of RNA
that's known to be recognized by so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: MS2-coid protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this hybrid forms, then LexA bound to
the DNA operator in the promoter of a gene
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest enables the reconstitution of
this triple hybrid and activation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, the answer is,
yes, IN2 in the yeast system can bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: the 3 prime UTR of BF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can judge this based on the blue
color or the lag Z activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter, as well as by activation of the
histidine by synthesis gene, and hence,
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of yeast in the media that lacks
supplementation with histidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This binding is sequence-specific,
so we see IN2 binding to the EBF2 3 prime
[SPEAKER_00]: in the direct orientation, but not in the
antisense orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We confirmed the physical interaction
between IN2 protein and EBF2 3 prime RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: via RNA immunoprecipitation experiment,
or RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is we transiently expressed
GFP-tagged IN2 in tobacco epidermis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we co-incubated the lysates with the
in vitro transcribed EBF2 mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that IN2 protein can
interact, whereas a control protein can
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are able to precipitate EBF2 3 prime
with the IN2, but not with a control
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, again, suggesting physical
interaction between the protein of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest and the RNA of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already raised this question before,
but IN2 has been thus described as an
[SPEAKER_00]: ER-localized protein, whose C-terminus in
the presence of ethylene can be cleaved
[SPEAKER_00]: and traveled to the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, all the prior reports have been
showing that IN2, not showing that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: another protoplast cell, but IN2 is
localized predominantly in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to regulate translation,
it needs to be in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something is off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reasoned that maybe for the IN2 to
be visibly localized in the cytoplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to increase the amount of EBF2 as
its target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we utilized a mutant
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a genetic trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This IN5 mutant has been previously
described to accumulate very high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of EBF RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has high levels of RNA, and this RNA
is localized in the cytoplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: then IN2 will be localized in the
cytoplasm as well if it interacts with
[SPEAKER_00]: EBF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, what we see is that in the IN5
background that over-accumulates EBF2
[SPEAKER_00]: mRNA, IN2 is predominantly localized in
the speckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this with the GFP-tugged version
and with the mCherry-tugged version of
[SPEAKER_00]: IN2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, by using marker
co-localization, we were able to show that
[SPEAKER_00]: the speckles correspond to the P bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned early on in my talk that P
bodies are processing bodies where RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: are either stored or degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see based on this, and this is
done in Arabidopsis protoplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we see the same things happening in
tobacco cells by using a transient
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of GFP-tugged IN2 in tobacco
epidermis and co-expressing the three
[SPEAKER_00]: primates of EBF2 in parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see the speckle P body
localization in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that when we have
three prime UTR of EBF2 present in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm, IN2 is retained in the
cytoplasm by the physical association with
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we can see that the transcript
itself, I'm not sure how well it's
[SPEAKER_00]: showing, but the transcript itself is in
speckles that we know are P bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only if the transcript contains the
three prime of EBF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we replace it with a NOS terminator,
we see very uniform localization,
[SPEAKER_00]: no more speckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this speckle P body localization
requires the three prime of EBF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point of my talk, I'm finally
ready to come back to the UPFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, I started out by telling
you about this novel class of integration
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants that just consists of three
different complementation groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned that UPF mutants are
partially insensitive to ethylene in their
[SPEAKER_00]: root tissues, but have more or less normal
response in the hypocotyls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in parallel with doing riboseq and
RNAseq in wild type plants, we carried out
[SPEAKER_00]: the same kind of experiments in UPF2
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first discovery we've made is just by
looking at the RNAseq data, not riboseq,
[SPEAKER_00]: but RNAseq, is that UPF2 mutation had no
effect on the transcriptional response of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene-regulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever was induced by ethylene in
Columbia was still induced in UPF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever was repressed by ethylene in
Columbia was still repressed in UPF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the transcriptional level, this is not
the case at the translational level,
[SPEAKER_00]: however.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember this EBF1 gene that I showed
you earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember, this gene is not
regulated at the level of transcription by
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene, but it's actually repressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you first Columbia
data to remind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repressed at the level of translation in
the presence of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the wild type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the UPF mutants, this translational
regulation is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the translational efficiency,
if anything, is higher in ethylene than it
[SPEAKER_00]: is in air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing holds for UPF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, in Columbia, EBF2 gene
was repressed by ethylene at the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now in the UPF2 mutant, this
translational effect is attenuated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to confirm this finding by
other means using polysomal versus total
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA and doing QRT PCR on the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, UPF mutations do not completely
wipe out the translational regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they attenuate regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see now that the response is
intermediate between that of wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, if you do the same thing with the
reporters, the same exact report as we
[SPEAKER_00]: used before, 35S treatment GFP and hooked
to the 3-prime UTR of EBF2, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see pretty much no more regulation at
the translational level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to mention here, that this
allele of UPF that we're using here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called UPF2-10, is a very, very weak
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we're using hypermorphic
allele as opposed to a null allele,
[SPEAKER_00]: because null mutants are lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seedling lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the experiments, such as riboseq,
you need a huge amount of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a gram of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people working with maize and
other large plants, that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Arabidopsis, to get a gram of
tissue, you need about 1,000 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're working with segregating
populations for a lethal mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really get enough tissue unless
you work with a hypermorphic fertile
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with hypermorphic alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, we expect a relatively weak
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phenotype is indeed weak,
but it's statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So furthermore, I show you the IN2 was
localized in the p-bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we see that UPF1, when it's hooked
with GFP, is also being targeted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: p-bodies, those speckles that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do collocalization studies
between mCherry-tagged IN2 and GFP-tagged
[SPEAKER_00]: UPF, we highlight exactly the same
p-bodies, so the same clusters of
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent within the cell, the same
loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that UPF1 and IN2
are collocalizing within the same cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: within the same structures, which are
p-bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also finally, the same way as we saw
physical interaction between IN2 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 3' of EBF2 RNA, we see the same
interaction between UPF1, this
[SPEAKER_00]: non-stimulated ADK component, and EBF2 3'.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the interaction with UPFs,
but we do not see the interaction between,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this was for UPF1, we do not see the
interaction with the UPF2, we do not see
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with UPF3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, all three proteins are
components of the same complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this complex interacts with the
transcript via UPF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a sequence-specific
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: To summarize what I told you thus far,
is that we've been able to carry out a
[SPEAKER_00]: foragenetic screen and identified a novel
class of mutants that we refer to as UPFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutations in this UPF gene corresponds to
disruptions in the core components of the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-stimulated ADK pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to be able to evaluate the role
of UPFs in mRNA surveillance or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: translational regulation, we implemented
the ribosome footprinting protocol in our
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, and we carried out this experiment
both in wild-type plants and in the UPF
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that I told you about were
this EBF1 and EBF2, the F-box proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: that are regulated by ethylene at the
translational level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also showed you that the specific part
of the EBF2 transcript, its 3' UTR,
[SPEAKER_00]: is both required and sufficient for this
ethylene-mediated translational
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also showed that biologically,
in the intact plant, this EBF2 3' UTR is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential for the normal response of
plants to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also saw that even with the weak
alleles of UPFs that we use in our
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments, we are able to see the
attenuation effect of UPF mutants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: translational regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, UPFs are required for the
translational effect of ethylene on EBF1
[SPEAKER_00]: and EBF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think probably the most drastic
finding was this new function for IN2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was always looked at as an
ER-localized protein whose C-terminus
[SPEAKER_00]: travels through the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we claim that IN2 has a cytoplasmic
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, IN2 can bind to an RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounded outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people said, no, IN2 cannot be an
RNA-binding protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just last year, our data were
corroborated by a high-throughput study
[SPEAKER_00]: where polyadenylated transcripts were
pulled out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the RNA-binding proteins that bind
to a pool of undefined RNAs were profiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IN2 was one of those proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IN2 does bind RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though some people were at the
beginning skeptical, but now even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: untargeted screen, IN2 comes out
suggesting that it's quite abundant in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of its binding to the transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't think that EBF2 is the only
target of IN2.
[SPEAKER_00]: IN2 presumably binds to many other
transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But EBF2 was the easiest to characterize,
given its very drastic phenotypes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene response assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, so we now suggest that there
is a novel branch of ethylene signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not dependent on transcription,
but has to do with translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to put this in a more
graphical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you that IN2 was viewed as being
split in the presence of ethylene and with
[SPEAKER_00]: the C-terminus traveling to the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we think there is a separate
cytoplasmic role of IN2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the nucleus, what IN2 does is it,
by an unknown mechanism, potentiates IN3
[SPEAKER_00]: and IL1, transcriptional master regulators
of ethylene signaling pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: enabling transcriptional activation of the
ethylene response gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those ethylene response gene is
EBF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when EBF2 mRNA is produced,
it travels out of the nucleus into
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm, where IN2 in cooperation with
UPF2 physically interacts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript and, through an unknown
mechanism, can inhibit translation of EBF2
[SPEAKER_00]: mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: From studies in yeast and from studies in
drosophila, we know that UPFs are capable
[SPEAKER_00]: of inhibiting translation by interfering
with the translation initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that what IN2 works as is a
sequence-specific RNA binding protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, through interaction between UPF
and mRNA, and IN2 and mRNA, this
[SPEAKER_00]: translational inhibition is brought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transcripts that are inhibited in
terms of their translation are being
[SPEAKER_00]: stored non-productively in the P-bodies
without being translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not being degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as ethylene signal is
withdrawn, and remember, ethylene is a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant is no longer facing
stress, ethylene is no longer made,
[SPEAKER_00]: so ethylene theoretically is withdrawn,
what happens is that IN2 protein gets
[SPEAKER_00]: degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IN2 comes out of the P-bodies,
gets degraded by the proteasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the absence of IN2,
the EBF2 mRNA can now be actively
[SPEAKER_00]: translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've been accumulating
transcripts without translating them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been able to now achieve high levels
of translation just by rapidly starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: translate the transcripts that have
accumulated in the P-bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those transcripts now, once they're
converted or translated into a protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: EBF2 protein can now travel into the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can degrade IN3 through the
proteasome-mediated pathway, shutting down
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of ethylene-responsive gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our basic model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have a lot of gaps in the
models and a lot of things we just
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're currently testing many of the
aspects of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this audience, instead of telling
you about the approaches we are taking to
[SPEAKER_00]: further test our model, I thought I will
talk about the conservation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism as well as about potential
application of the translational
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question that probably you're
thinking about is, how widespread and how
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved is the translation regulation
mechanism that we uncovered?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do other signaling pathways utilize a
similar translation regulation mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started out my talk by saying that
I'm interested not only in ethylene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So side by side, we're doing this ethylene
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also performed an RNA-seq and riboseq
experiment with the IAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been long known that there's quite a
bit of crosstalk between ethylene and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen at the transcriptional level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we see that not only do these two
hormones communicate with one another at
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of the transcript, they're also
communicating with one another at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overlap is quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to show you is that,
in fact, there's a limited number of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are translationally regulated by
oxygen, suggesting that 50 genes is not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually that little, that oxygen can also
control translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, what are those two
genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those genes is EBF-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you EBF-1 that it's repressed at
the translational level by ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we see even greater translational
inhibition, but by oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Etoxyacetic acid is one of the oxygens
that we use in our experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see about 30% translation efficiency
for EBF-1 in oxygen compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a 40% inhibition, if you remember,
in the case of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some preliminary data
suggesting this IAA-mediated inhibition of
[SPEAKER_00]: EBF-1 translation is IA2-independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would suggest that IAA works through
some unknown RNA-binding protein yet to be
[SPEAKER_00]: identified to regulate translation of
EBF-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't yet know if UPFs are involved,
but we know that IA2 is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of preliminary findings make
our life even more exciting, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us that probably the mechanism
we're working with is not that unique to
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other pathways may be utilizing
similar mechanistic modules to control
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second question that I wanted to
raise is, well, who cares about
[SPEAKER_00]: herbidopsis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do crop species, do other plants,
utilize similar mechanisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the preliminary answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data to support this claim are as
follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using Nicosiana bintamiana,
it's not a crop, but it's a model organism
[SPEAKER_00]: for crops, we can see that the 3-prime ETR
of EBF-2 can be repressed at the
[SPEAKER_00]: translational level in the presence of the
ethylene precursor ECC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take a 3-prime UTR of EBF-2 gene
from a tomato, so we're just subcloning
[SPEAKER_00]: the same part of the gene, but from a
tomato version of EBF-2, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see translational repression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the transient assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we now do the same kind of experiment,
but in stably transformed plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're taking herbidopsis, and we're
putting GFP driven by 35S times with
[SPEAKER_00]: EBF-2, 3-prime UTR, we already know that
in herbidopsis, we see nice translational
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition, but now we're using in
herbidopsis, the tomato version of EBF-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't know if you can see it,
because the basal level expression is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit lower, but believe me,
it's actually also repressed nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're doing the reciprocal
experiment, where we're taking tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and transforming them with a tomato
and herbidopsis construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some preliminary data,
but literally out of press two days ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: that seems to be the case as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 3-prime UTR from whichever species,
tomato or herbidopsis, works to repress
[SPEAKER_00]: translation of, in this case, GFP
reporter, both in tomato and in
[SPEAKER_00]: herbidopsis, and as you saw in the
transient assay, in tobacco as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably what's the most interesting
to this audience is, is there something
[SPEAKER_00]: about our discovery that can be somehow
translated into applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnological applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we take advantage of the specific CIS
elements that we identified and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: the CIS elements the way, for example,
promoters are being used in the various
[SPEAKER_00]: types of biotechnological applications to
control agricultural traits of interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any actual data, but I have
some ideas that we are now writing up into
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA proposal, which we think would allow
us to answer this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the ideas are actually quite
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we make conditional dominant
mutants by mutating the 3-prime UTRs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes of interest that are translated,
that are regulated at the translational
[SPEAKER_00]: level by ethylene?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that genes like EBF2 are
repressed by ethylene at the translational
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if we mutate the sites to
which RNA binding proteins, such as IN2
[SPEAKER_00]: and UPF bind?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to abolish the ethylene
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would this be useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to give you one example of
the potential application with the EBFs
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and tomato fruit ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tomato fruit ripening, tomato evolution
increases at a breaker plus 10 days or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then ethylene eventually, ethylene
evolution or ethylene emission eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: declines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally, at the time when ethylene
production goes up, so does the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tomato EBFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three out of four tomato EBFs are
upregulated at a time when also ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we believe is happening is that
the transcripts go up, but the proteins do
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the same translational mechanism takes
place as an arabidopsis, then this
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of the transcript doesn't
really convert into more protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protein is not being synthesized
because ethylene is still there to inhibit
[SPEAKER_00]: translation of those transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine now that we introduce mutations
in the three prime UTR of tomato EBF2,
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example, that should increase the
translation of EBF2 in the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we increase translation of EBF2,
with EBF2 being a negative regulator of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ethylene signaling pathway,
we expect to see reduced ethylene signal
[SPEAKER_00]: transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with less signaling, we expect to see
delayed fruit ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, at this point, this is just a
hypothesis, but we are going to test this
[SPEAKER_00]: with the lines that we are already
generating in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally learn to transform tomato
because up to now we were basic
[SPEAKER_00]: arabidopsis biologists, and it looks like
the approach is working, but the data is
[SPEAKER_00]: too preliminary to present it in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reciprocal approach would be to
take any gene of interest, a gene that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not normally regulated by ethylene at the
translational level, and convert it into
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene-regulated gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if we take the three prime UTR of
our favorite gene, EBF2, and hook it to
[SPEAKER_00]: any gene of interest and make a mutant
version of this gene, a cisgenic mutant of
[SPEAKER_00]: this allele, as a conditional repressible
mutant that in the presence of ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: would no longer be translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we envision is with genes like
pectate lyase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pectate lyase is a gene encoding an enzyme
required for fruit softening prior work
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that by just knocking down
expression of pectate lyase, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: firmer fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is wild type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is plants with an RNAi construct for
pectate lyase, and the fruits are much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much firmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that ethylene evolution
increases temporary, and in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner or later, ethylene concentrations
or ethylene emission declines,
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought that if we were to replace the
native three prime of pectate lyase with
[SPEAKER_00]: the EBF2 three prime, we should be able to
confer ethylene-mediated regulation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: translation of the pectate lyase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would this be helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when ethylene concentrations are
high, this particular transcript will be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced, but it will not be translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the transcript is not translated,
then you will have very, very firm fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sooner or later, when the ethylene
native or endogenous concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene declines, so will the effect of
the PL of the pectate lyase gene will come
[SPEAKER_00]: up because now the gene will be translated
actively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this stage, it will not be
translated, and at this stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fruits will only become firm when
they're brought to you as a consumer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the supermarket, and the fruits will stay
firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the current goals of
various tomato breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think that my approaches are
naive, but we are trying to test this and
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if by hooking up the three prime
UTR of EBF2 gene to genes like pectate
[SPEAKER_00]: lyase through CRISPR and other approaches,
we are able to achieve the delay in
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to throw a couple additional
ideas as to how we're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, the three prime UTRs and
other cis elements required for
[SPEAKER_00]: translation and regulation can be
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of the cis elements as new
promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, you would take your favorite
promoter, such as E8 fruit ripening
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter, and hook your gene of interest
to this promoter to confer fruit-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we can do is by using the cis
elements from whichever genes we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, such as EBF2, we're able to
confer translational regulation by
[SPEAKER_00]: specific stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say instead of ethylene,
we identified a translational
[SPEAKER_00]: cis-regulatory element induced by drought,
or by salinity, or by heat, or by
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we withhold translation in the
presence of a stress stimulus and then
[SPEAKER_00]: vice versa reactivate translation,
let's say when the drought is relieved by
[SPEAKER_00]: rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you some data from
EBF2 and ethylene, but we hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: similar approaches will be useful in the
case of other stimuli, other stress
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that in the absence of
ethylene, this GFP reporter hooked to EBF2
[SPEAKER_00]: is highly translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the presence of ethylene, translation
is abolished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the mechanism that I described.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you withdraw ethylene, within two
hours, translation is revamped,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get plenty of protein made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that at the time when ethylene
treatment is applied, transcripts are
[SPEAKER_00]: still accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you withdraw ethylene
signal, the transcripts start rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: getting translated, and you can bring up
the level of the protein within two hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine, so now we hook this
three-prime UTR to a gene of interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as a growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this growth regulator will be not
produced for as long as there's a stress
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as the stress is relieved,
you will start making huge amounts of a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific growth regulator protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will be able to recover
growth as soon as, let's say, drought is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, maybe this is very naive,
but we're excited about the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate agricultural traits using these
approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another potential approach is with
this element specific to various stress
[SPEAKER_00]: factors is to use them as molecular
sponges to remove the activity or
[SPEAKER_00]: sequester the activity of various types of
RNA-bionic proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our work with ethylene, what we know
is that the lines that carry the
[SPEAKER_00]: three-prime UTR of EBF2, many of them,
if we increase the expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we select for the lines that are the
most highly expressing, we get ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: insensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not due to silencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because if we silence the gene,
EBF2, we would expect that the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: become hypersensitive to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insensitivity in this case presumably
comes from the fact that this
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpressed construct, those
overexpressed transcripts are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestering RNA-binding proteins such as
IN2 and UPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can sequester the RNA-binding effect
and make them unavailable to bind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: native three-prime UTRs of whichever
genes, hence eliminate the effect and make
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, in this case, ethylene
insensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope to be able to use this
molecular sponge approach for other stress
[SPEAKER_00]: stimuli such as drought, salinity,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm done here, and I'd like to
acknowledge my husband, my collaborator,
[SPEAKER_00]: my best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, we've been working in the
ethylene-oxidant interaction field since
[SPEAKER_00]: my days in graduate school.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work that I described today has been
conceived and processed by us together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had some talented post-docs,
Karen Merchant and Javier Brumoz,
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this project with Karen,
focusing on the ribosic studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Javier Brumoz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Javier Brumoz working on all the
protoplast and yeast data for the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were able to publish this paper a
year and a half ago, and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Miguel Perez Amador, he was a
visiting scientist from Spain in our
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very helpful in optimizing the
ribosome footprinting protocol to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, instead of a two-week procedure,
we are able to do ribosome footprinting in
[SPEAKER_00]: three to four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jongai is our talented technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been helpful in many of the stages
of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tina was an undergrad that helped me,
I was a post-doc at the time, to
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize all the UPF mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can imagine, out of a screen,
you get hundreds of mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do complementation crossing,
to be able to separate them into
[SPEAKER_00]: complementation groups was quite a
challenge, and Tina was very, very helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Serena is our new post-doc that's
continuing the work on translational
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, working predominantly on auxin
and its effect on translational
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nick Ngolia is the person who actually
developed the ribosome footprinting
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had him come out to anti-state and
share some of the tricks for us when we
[SPEAKER_00]: were having trouble implementing the
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was incredibly helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stefan and Ky Nguyen are our
bioinformaticians that helped with the
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of the data we were generating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hongwei Guo, he co-published his story on
EBF-1 and EBF-2 in parallel, side-by-side
[SPEAKER_00]: with us in cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, Brad Binder, I didn't get to
talk to him, talk about his work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was very helpful in the mutant
characterization of the UPFs, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the kinetic studies of the ethylene
response to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last, but not the least,
our funding sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is supported by NSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had some internal funding from
NCSU, and also Karen Merchanty,
[SPEAKER_00]: a talented post-doc in our group,
was supported by a Marie Curie Fellowship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll be happy to take your
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice story, Karen, and the story
there all together.
Yeah.
But do you know, have you tried to chew up
the three-time UTR to see what's the
significance of it without, or how do you
know the problem is being seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't seem to be the sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the secondary structure
that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we have a new region that's
required for the right to binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, in our story, we got to the
specific elements to the three-time UTR,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're right to binding approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is, because we had a list of
genes that are, I think, regulated at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of translation, we looked for the
colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is common within the three-time UTRs
of the genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came up with a domain that is
present multiple times, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the three-time UTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one, but both multiple times,
and we have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hongwei Huo's group, that Paul published
in parallel with us, they did it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the classical dashing approach by removing
parts of the three-time UTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to come up with the same
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you reach elements,
but it's not the sequence itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the secondary structure that's
required.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your model, where you described auxin
and ethylene, we gave you these responses,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you said that it did appear that auxin
is going through I2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible that ethylene is going
through auxin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that ethylene can regulate auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ethylene regulating auxin
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the timing of the
response, I would think the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot completely exclude the
possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you're saying, that I am
working through I2s, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I worked somehow, maybe,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do processes in that one process
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect of ethylene is very rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I doubt that this is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with the transcription,
people see transcriptional changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just within 30 seconds, which I
never really fully believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's theoretically possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not exclude it outright,
but it's unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it independent of the translation?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what you're pointing out to,
it's very possible that rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: staying in the cycle class, maybe I am too
end of the nucleus, and together with the
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer, going through the transfer of I2
and comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that we had to test this idea
is to test this possibility is by using a
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleic-excluded version of I2 and vice
versa, nucleus-only version of I2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've tried to do this experiment,
but unfortunately, all the plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: silenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't achieve the answer because
of the technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you try to keep I2 only in the
nucleus, it's silenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to keep I2 only out of the
nucleus, it's silenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it's very possible that rather
than staying, in the cycle class,
[SPEAKER_00]: I2C turnus migrates in the nucleus first,
binds to the EBF transfer that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: freshly made, and then comes out with the
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, unfortunately, the assumption here
is that the ribosome is bound to a
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that's not always the case
because we see a lot of stalled ribosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stalled columns, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see a ribosome stalling at the
start sites because it takes a while for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to actually, I guess, hold a
translation initiation elongation factor
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to bind to the ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the assumption, again, is that if the
ribosome is bound, it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: translating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some cases, in the cases,
especially when the five prime ETRs,
[SPEAKER_00]: five prime, not three prime, so the
meaning of the transcript contains small,
[SPEAKER_00]: open reading frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we open to see a lot of ribosomes
stuck in the five prime ETRs that never
[SPEAKER_00]: reach into the main genetic work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would suggest that the genetic work
will not be translated because the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribosomes are being retained in the five
prime EORs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that case, through their
localization, depending on where they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're in the five prime versus in the
main EOR, we can speculate that the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are stuck in the EORs may never be
able to reach to the main EOR in the case
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're in the main EOR, they're
already translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, if the ribosome is within
the transcript itself, and we don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: any atypical localization, because in some
cases, ribosomes will be stuck before they
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to resolve and complicate a
secondary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, rather than uniform
distribution of reads, we see certain
[SPEAKER_00]: reads accumulating as a complex part of
the transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the assumption is that every ribosome
that sits on the transcript is translated
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's within the open reading
frame, within the coding region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that majority of it is in the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that even the classical region
of experience, some of the states in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm, it's just not focused enough,
of course, to say all these are p-bots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all of it is in the nucleus,
but it's hard to distinguish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which part of that is ER, and which part
of that is p-bots or a soluble cytoplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't have the exact numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we see a lot of variability,
no matter which system we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some photographs, we see some
photographs where pretty much everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the nucleus, and in some cases,
you have significant proportions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the expectation is most of it is in
the nucleus, because classically,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody realizes it was cytoplasmic protein
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you may have touched on this at
the beginning of your seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you did the riboseq versus the
RNAseq, did you get a sense of what
[SPEAKER_03]: portion of genes are actually involved in
this inhibition at the translational
[SPEAKER_03]: level?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a single time point in response to
ethylene, we see anywhere between five to
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 genes or so depending on the
stringency that we're using in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can clearly say that there's a lot
fewer genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: translation-irregulating than there are
transcription-irregulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in the cases when we see only 50%
difference between translation in air and
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene, the biological role is so
dramatic that by just removing this
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, you lose sensitivity to
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't necessarily expect to have
complete inhibition of translation to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that big physiological effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even minor differences can account for
large biological significant differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true that fewer genes are
translation-irregulating than there are
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription-irregulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you tried other hormones?
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried other hormones, and we've been
doing a time course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the pitfalls of our
approach is that we're only using one time
[SPEAKER_00]: point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we randomly chose a four-hour time
point just because we already had RNAseq
[SPEAKER_00]: data for that same time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the perfect time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll see a lot bigger list of genes
at 10 hours or so, but there's 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our current BGRP funding allows us to
do time course for ethylenopsis in tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: and anoragrapsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're heavily invested in optimizing
the protocols even further to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: process so many samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, it's still quite
liberating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's no other questions,
let's thank all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
