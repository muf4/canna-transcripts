[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I talk about my mom and my dad,
I make sure that my mom gets first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in an ad, she said, I was
mentioned first, and my name was in bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though she's passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's seminar is going to be a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of data, but hopefully an idea
of, because I don't think a lot of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to become apple breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little bit of the fascination that
we find working in this crop and working
[SPEAKER_00]: in any crop from a horticulture breeding
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I am not going to be able to
acknowledge everyone that's been a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does take a village.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've benefited from my predecessors,
Dr. Roger Way and Bob Lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came in 1985, I knew very little
about apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew enough to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they graciously let me be the expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, they welcomed me into
their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that I can be as gracious when
I retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But despite rumors, not happening for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to acknowledge in the front
and the back, because I know I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: forget people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, I've been blessed
to have an amazing research support
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist in Kevin Maloney, and also
David Terry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before Kevin, many colleagues past and
present in horticulture, entomology,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathology, food science,
Boyce Thompson, USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an amazing farm and field crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do our research without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 73 plus acres, 33 acres of
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to take care of all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing students, including some in the
room, and summer scholars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we benefit greatly from Cornell
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's talk, as I said, I'd like to
give a brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to convey the fun in research
and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am blessed because I have one of the
best jobs that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can discover and study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more questions than there are
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this arena especially, you're able to
create something that's never been created
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are seeing fruit for the first time
that no one's tasted, no one's
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's amazing, and other
times it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, you learn a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my PhD in genetics because I worked
for a very renowned plant breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred Huff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me miles of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, see this cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go and I'm going to become a
plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to become a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not going to happen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can know a lot about genetics,
but there's always something that gets in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other fact is apples are
incredibly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not, my apologies to those in the
room, I could not work on wheat or
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need it to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apples are far from uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to share some of that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, apples bring out the fanatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our showcases used to make an
apple map of New York state with apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to have a showcase a week
from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not having that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other artwork is in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a festival where they put apples
on nails and they make these huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had a researcher that came and
visited the repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was fascinated with the apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, I'd like to see other
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took her out to see some of our
architectural mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she fell in love and she did a photo
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now only an LA photo expert can come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, can we bring snow machines
if there's not snow?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure there's going to be snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing this for a colleague that I
hope is in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apples are extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a lot of requests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that they are not enjoying
the cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are lucky to have something that
gets general interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just ticked off half of the
vegetable growers and researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll get used to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into a lot of trouble because
there's not a consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fight over the progenitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know you're in trouble when you
can't even agree on a name for cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's also incredibly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have triploids, tetraploids,
apamex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 25 to 34 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't tapped the surface of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an incompatibility system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means when I want to incorporate a
gene, I have to backcross it to something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plus is that it's clonally
propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I find something, I can fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that I learned and would be
helpful, any of you students, if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take a course on communicating science to
lay audiences, I'd strongly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the best examples of how
many of you have read the Botany of
[SPEAKER_00]: Desire?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That book brought the attention to the
germplasm collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was written in a way that
people, it resonated with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had people come on motorcycle across
country to see the Kazakh forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, don't you think you would
have called ahead to see if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it showed the power of writing
something from a lay perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what we're trying to do in
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very fortunate that the USDA
repository has over 2,000 to 3,000
[SPEAKER_00]: selections that I can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the government pays for them,
which is an example of government funding
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to pay for it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Ganyuan Zhang and Dr. Thomas Chow
are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have a graduate student that is
in the Pathways program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got a PhD with me and Ganyuan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go on to work at the
repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more about him later.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came and started in Apple in 1994,
this was the list of genes that we knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a Google search now on Apple genes,
and you're just blown away, many of which
[SPEAKER_00]: were reported by people like LeLang and
Greg and others that were starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've come an amazingly long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the breakthroughs was the
publishing of the Apple genome from Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 54,000 genes, more than a chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you win the Jeopardy
category for apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really helped us in terms of
discovering new genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then recently, Dr. Fei's lab at BTI
followed and resequenced many things to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the history of Apple and how the
evolution of fruit size happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a chance to read this paper,
I'd strongly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of breeders, especially when
they start out, aren't going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: interspecific hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're going to do a cross and
they want to get a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to go back that far and
work with something that's very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we started doing some
interspecific hybrids to actually to work
[SPEAKER_00]: on Ben Archesky's progeny, we found that a
normal apple seedling just grows like a
[SPEAKER_00]: stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use an interspecific hybrid,
we got 21 laterals, which we don't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also get small laterals also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the greenhouse crew were going by and
they said, talk about hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you could see it, we had trees
that were growing like vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the great potential that we
have if we want to tap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a member of Rosebreed, which is marker
assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an SCRI, similar to Bruce's Vitis
Gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all the three major apple breeding
programs in Minnesota, Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: and New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a grower commented that if a bomb blew
out, there goes apple breeding in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike areas like Japan, where there's
21 apple breeders, we used to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: apple breeding program for every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably wasn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, fortunately, we're all good
friends and we share germplasm and we
[SPEAKER_00]: share the data so that we can get more
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a great impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great advisory panel with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, apples need to
satisfy consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know with consumers,
the most important attributes are
[SPEAKER_00]: crispness, crunch, texture, flavor,
flavor being a little bit less important,
[SPEAKER_00]: juiciness, sugar, and acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they have to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you eat a bad apple,
you remember it as worse than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you eat a good apple,
you remember it as better than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of stuck because you're
saying, hmm, this isn't as good as the
[SPEAKER_00]: last one, or I think I'm switching to
bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make sure that we keep on
having them be consistent, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in Washington, Germany, or here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're identifying markers to help us
with that consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Don said, we're one of the oldest
programs, one of the largest programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've named 66 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We integrate breeding, genetics,
and genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very much multidisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I can't acknowledge half the
people that we've benefited from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cornell Cooperative Extension is key
to getting our information out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do controlled hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great job for graduate
students, right, Ben?
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking out pollen is a lovely thing to do
while you watch TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a lot of pollen out every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get to the blossoms before bees
do, because they're going to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned, and anybody that's heard me
lecture before, I got in trouble because
[SPEAKER_00]: my new husband at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went out, and I had been working in
the field all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you look really tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, I've been emasculating all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, please don't say that in
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that has kids, you know the
diversity that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get to have kids, thousands of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't like a particular mother,
I can make her a father.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can create promiscuity in the
orchard and just go wild with different
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crosses and families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the Triscuit commercial where the
lady says she's not genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we're proponents of
biotechnology, but we also get grief about
[SPEAKER_00]: our new varieties, about Frankenfood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, our apples have been genetically
modified, but they are not genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: modified organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have genes outside of apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give the example of my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick two parents, and you want the
offspring to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want the offspring to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with children, you sometimes get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got double doses of stubbornness of
these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the apple progenies you're looking,
you don't want them to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because apple is so diverse,
that makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then as I said, you find something
promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sad part is sometimes you'll see a
seedling and it has two fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin and I will eat it and go,
oh my god, those were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to wait a year and hope
that it fruits again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you'll find a very promising
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we clonally propagate by budding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a bud from that tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make hundreds of copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fortunate at Geneva to have somebody
that works in the bottom part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the root stock, generofosio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets as excited about the root system
as I do about the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that we need to start
looking at the interaction between stock
[SPEAKER_00]: and scion, because there's so much that
could be learned about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell varieties that we're best known
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cortland is now in heirloom, being over
100 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: McCowen's getting close, Empire and
Johnagold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew we were onto something when we
were asked to go to New York Farm Day in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shawa, my student at the time,
went with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're showing apple samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were competing against fresh
oysters, wine, hors d'oeuvres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, oh, this is going to be a
long night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a staffer came over, and she ate this
apple, and she screamed, get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she starts calling staffers over to
try these apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, OK, well, this is looking
promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was Snapdragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little industry overview, if you don't
know it, we have 674 apple growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're second in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macintosh is still our number one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our growers were finding they
couldn't get access to a lot of the club
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, like Pink Lady, or Jazz,
or Pacific Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that with Snapdragon and Ruby
Frost, we had two apples that were good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we needed an organization to foster
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to give it to one grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were looking for an organization
that didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I thank my industry,
because all these men and women have full
[SPEAKER_00]: time jobs producing apples, packing
apples, studying them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Susan, can you define what you mean by
club?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So club means that it's managed so a
certain number of growers can join.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, it was every grower in New
York had the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spend money in marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is both patented and trademarked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anybody else has to be
sub-licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were clubs that picked and
choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a brother might have, he might be a
member of a club, and his neighboring farm
[SPEAKER_00]: brother was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we needed a new organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to move the varieties forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empire and Johnagle took forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take 40 years before a variety
becomes popular, because a grower is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take the chance on growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be selling a lot of this
variety unless he knows it has a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed dollars for marketing and
promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pat Hooker was the commissioner of ag
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other breeding programs have sold to,
in one state, they sold to a competitor
[SPEAKER_00]: state, a particular fruit variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't go over well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Pat Hooker said, it's going to be a
long walk to the governor's office if you
[SPEAKER_00]: sell this to another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we told the growers we were interested
in doing it, but they had to offer it to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to be equal partners in risk
and rewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the core group that started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a nice day after about two
years of negotiations with IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for commercialization, they committed
to plant 900 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to give grocery stores
enough volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 60% Snapdragon and 40% Ruby
Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going to be in retail stores,
stands in 2013, and in stores 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we wanted stands is that
Honeycrisp was never marketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly is a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was because retail stands,
people got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to have that interface
for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York Snapdragon is a cross of
Honeycrisp by a apple that's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanted is I like Honeycrisp,
but I wanted more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted less of the disorders that it
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first tree in the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told Kevin Maloney, we can't pick
the first tree in the row because our
[SPEAKER_00]: stomachs aren't sour yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and we looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, this is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some growers signed on to grow
Snapdragon without ever having tasted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they saw pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw pictures of the productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had faith in the Geneva program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ruby Frost was actually a study that
I'll show later that a graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to look at the genetics of
vitamin C, increasing vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to create reduced browning
after you cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ruby Frost is a hybrid of Braeburn
by Autumncrisp, which some of you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have tried at Cornell Orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great reaction in consumer tests and is
high in vitamin C and low in browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I got to interact with Deb Perozio's
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our growers had the kids come up with
ideas for varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there were some, if any of you are
still here, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some really good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were so proud to be part of Cornell
because these kids, some of them did it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had merchandising, all set socks,
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was Royal Flush, which may be a great
card hand, but not a great apple name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did a really nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we didn't choose any of the
names, but it was a great experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris Watkins and Joseph and Jackie,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really benefited from Chris Watkins in
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I told Chris, he said, I'm not going
to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, you're not going to hear
the good things that I say about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I once at a meeting said, my apples
are so good, I don't need a post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris literally made me eat my words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's, and Jackie and Frannie when she
was here, we established the best picking
[SPEAKER_00]: dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at storage disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have growers sample because they
wouldn't believe that certain harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: were better than other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Joseph knows how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also learn that you don't stop at
Subway and get a 14 inch sub before apple
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting, because every single one of these
guys that Craig photographed turned green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they know that you have to pace
yourself, but it really, having the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry involved and what the best
harvest date has been really invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you that when you see
your varieties in the grocery store,
[SPEAKER_00]: just nothing better than that,
because some breeders retire before they
[SPEAKER_00]: see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my husband was at the store and I
said, what's the reaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, people are lining up for miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Helene Dillard when she was here,
she went to the ethical market and they
[SPEAKER_00]: only let her buy five snapdragons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, but I know the breeder
didn't help her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a thing of beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to shift a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of you that are working in
horticultural commodities, understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: variation is key and it can't be
emphasized enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, how to phenotype at the
right stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had fights about this with Rosebreed
because they wanted to use a starch iodine
[SPEAKER_00]: of eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing a starch iodine reading,
which shows maturity of eight tells you is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to pick it when a grower
would pick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the right stage,
minimizing variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be variation to the fruit
cluster, the age of the tree, the root
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, the stage of development,
the crop load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like computing garbage in,
garbage out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you can't, I can't
emphasize this point enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like an apple, if you're doing a study
on ethylene and you have a king flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that's developed, so king dominant and
laterals, if you're only picking the king
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, what's happening when you're
plucking that apple off?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating a wound and you're
creating ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also having problems with,
you know, do you choose to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: king or the laterals?
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding that is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never enough, never big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see somebody that looked at five
apples from a tree, that's not going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apples, as I said, are very variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The developmental stage and what's
happening with ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Sushen Gadhir who's an expert
on ethylene and we need to make sure we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what is the stage that we're
looking at and is that the best stage to
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to switch to architecture a
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Miller said, don't let him down in
the seminar and even with columnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's my mandatory columnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So columnar is a dominant gene and weeping
is a dominant gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when you cross them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get, they fight it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get columnar on the top,
weeping on the bottom, you get some
[SPEAKER_00]: weeping, you get everything in between,
and it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you just get to go out there and
see this and say, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alexo said that tree is a tree that
doesn't know what it wants to be when it
[SPEAKER_00]: grows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that plant architecture
branches should go horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a little carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good for pruning, but you can see the
variation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not pruned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wide branch angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an oxymutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately it doesn't fruit,
but you could have apples on spokes of a
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can bet money for people that are
like, that's not an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even feel plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers are like little Arabidopsis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, when I talk about Ben,
we have different isomers of compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these little leaf things are just
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have things that shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Kanung Ju is looking at a lot of this
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a grant working with Chris Dardick
and he's going to be publishing on weeping
[SPEAKER_00]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his group has been a really valuable
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just have stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tree, its sisters are 20 feet
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what makes it have all that growth
condensed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this cross, those are sister
seedlings, the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one is dwarf and one isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of having graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Xiaowa, who we benefited greatly from
Peter's willingness to let us use his
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive equipment and offer mentoring,
was able to look at gibberellin and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we haven't commercialized these
yet, we have developed some lines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really good quality for probably the whole
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we do a lot of mapping and
genetic studies, we have skewed
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because we have things like pale
green lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name is what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or dwarfs that most people don't think
they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die and so they don't know that those
might be linked with genes of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ben Archesky, it's always good to have
a graduate student that's as interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: strange things as you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started looking at columnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a side project on pale green
lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found out that pale green lethal
plants were not able to produce vitamin K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that influences photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the beauty of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had somebody contact me about Arctic
apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I googled them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Parker, so Ben says it's
phyloquinone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I googled Dr. Parker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Parker is an expert on
phyloquinone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, could you run some tests and
see if you can detect this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, he did and is an author on
one of those papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's cool about this is the pale
green lethal is this tiny little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put vitamin K on it,
it starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never quite rescues the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But poor Ben sprayed vitamin K on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, he said, can I stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the blue line was where he
stopped application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, you have the restored
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it starts becoming chlorotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a great proof of concept
between the gene and the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Ben Guterres, I had a picture of him
with a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't hate veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to have a picture of him with
apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he brought in his baby to see me
this past weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have to ask you, what has he told
this baby about his advisor?
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ben is very smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has his Defense Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like bringing a baby in to your
advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's coming this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to steal his thunder about
his work in dihydrochalcolons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given his exit seminar Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can attend, that would be
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll straighten the kid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suburb scholars, what we are able to do
is we have a program at Geneva that for
[SPEAKER_00]: eight weeks, kids come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're juniors or seniors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for eight weeks, they become
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in eight weeks, granted, we all have
other stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do a lit search, do a research
project, and get a poster out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every single one of these kids does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been fortunate to have one every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Caitlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is one of either eight or 11 kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came to the station with a little
suitcase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, don't you have more stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, I want to have eight
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had five kids, a three-year absent,
and triplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's a triplet.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was really lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a wonderful, bright girl,
but loved being at the station.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at ornamental crabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nina knows I started in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my creative side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to replace Mark Brant with
his Ulster area, but these are columnar
[SPEAKER_00]: and different lobing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she was able to look at lobing and
the genetics of that in an eight-week
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last scholar before this year looked at
fruit set and cider apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg, we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of apple is she looked at
fruit set and a malice-fusca cross that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at because of tannin content
for hard cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she gets data that she can publish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nobody's really looked at fruit
set in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Byron Rustak was my last student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeff was also a student in the summer
scholars program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to do phenotyping of a
progeny that Ben had done GBS for and was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to discover a new QTL for the
columnar locus in that eight-week project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to wrap it up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red skin color, red is dominant to yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they don't tell you is,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have a red apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have a green apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a marker for red and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't work for green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been trying to breed a green apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have created the most sicklingly
shade of green that you can ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't come out pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have learned that it's due to a MIB
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing transgenic studies,
not us, but others on overexpression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the color pattern, whether it's
striped or blushed, matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just kind of the wows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these red apples, which, I'm sorry,
I don't know your name, Katie loves,
[SPEAKER_00]: are sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to market them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I predict that people are going to buy
them once and say, well, I was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: school, and then not buy them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said that about rocket apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got bought out for $8 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I better keep my day job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm showing you is, Caitlin went
out and she looked at the progenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, all the leaves are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that can't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a dominant gene for red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look at the laterals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves came out green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the laterals produced red after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a phase change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a bit of the diversity,
where we're looking at beautiful double
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, scab resistant, different forms
and shapes, emphasizing disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at resistance to scab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed to have Herbaldwinkle,
Avescone, Carrocox, a number of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that collaborated on scab rate and plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to miss a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at scab resistance, powdery
mildew, black rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have southern diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to know what your material
is, because we love this novel stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another breeder said, well,
if you want my crazy stuff, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually throw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we're going to get
answers by having some of that crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this I love, because this is one fruit
in a population of an ugly, high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: By a speckled apple, that's good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that, I think the yellow
is an outcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that you get varying
degrees of red in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get ugly again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get pretty amazing line of
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality of these things is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single apple is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not usually happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit size, five genes for fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the jackpot on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't win the lottery, but I can line up
those genes for fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brewer said that he's going to call them
apple nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to laugh all the way to the
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced vitamin C is important for apple
dippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was Andrea's research that shows some
of our advanced selections are amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: high in vitamin C compared to the standard
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do transgenic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say we, I mean, LaLang,
Avaise, Canong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So silencing is teaching us about ethylene
and other stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: LaLang has reduced sorbitol lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's interest in arctic
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I show this especially with Peter
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pro biotechnology what it offers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's amazing what groups do to prey on
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's brilliant to have a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm a baby sucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a baby and Snow White and,
you know, it's not based on science,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does resonate with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so arctic apples are being test
marketed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what the public decides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of different hybrids with
potential for future commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're writing three patents right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with having apples is I wanted
to bring some today, but they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: easily carried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe you one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, acknowledging current and former
students, my technicians, Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has been amazingly generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to garner funding from
different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show this shot, Martin Duff,
and I took it after fall to show that we
[SPEAKER_00]: really are creating some very productive
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody asked me why I engineered
them not to have leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad to answer any questions if
anybody has them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to reach out to my Geneva
crew, because I feel bad that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Geneva, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned from Kevin this fall that
Snapdragon does not drop below in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit a pressure of 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, you have to decide when to
pick it by the starch number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is that a beneficial character,
which improves its post-harvest behavior?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, are we going to see more
selections that are similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of selections that are
performing very well from a storage and
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf life perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions at Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Ithaca's turn.
Don?
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember many years ago, we had a
researcher from Geneva, Phil Forslund,
[SPEAKER_04]: speak about the origins of apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in your early years of apple breeding,
were you able to learn from Phil?
[SPEAKER_04]: And was that helpful to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil's a wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I was not so interested
in going back in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So malice aversi is the progenitor
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls off the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I admit that I kind of put it
aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are very much embracing the use of
interspecific hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil is going to be with Herb Aldwinkle on
a CBS news show on the Kazakh apples and
[SPEAKER_00]: their trip to the center of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Your last slide, incredible yield there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the strength of branches?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've heard hobby apple growers
have said my branches break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the key is you want a branch
angle to be as close as 90 degrees as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the strongest branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeowners tend to have very, you know,
they're not pruning it or training it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll just crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that that branch angle is one of the
characters you would look at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also not dropping the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has its disadvantages because if
fruit don't drop, when we thin them,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the mummies stay on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an avenue for further diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got criticized that my apples are too
firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's not a criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with dentures aren't going to like
it, but just use a knife then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the genotype influence the
performance of the variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize to the crew at Geneva
because I forgot to repeat the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is if the root stock
affects the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are resistances in the root
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make them bear earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It influences branch angle, which I
thought was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also influences on calcium and
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that Llang and Ben and others
are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the root stock holds a lot of
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I really think being able
to study what gets transported and what
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't would be hugely helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed it during your description of the
club model.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm curious what happens when the rest
of the US or the world wants to try some
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruby Frost or Snapdragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does dissemination of those materials
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hannah was asking about how does a club
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about when other people outside of
New York State want access?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one grower asked if he could buy a foot
of land in New York and become a New York
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the ability to sub-license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the future, Cosmic Crisp is
going to come from Washington with
[SPEAKER_00]: millions and millions of boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we will sub-license to other
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for international marketing,
we are going to license to other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: with the caveat that they can't export
into the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that protects our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a grower, a nurseryman from
Belgium, and he said, we went out to
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner and he asked the waitress about
Snapdragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just looked at him like,
you know, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I came all the way from
Belgium to test this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, this is where you get
humbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious about how you approach
selecting based on taste and tartness
versus sweet.
Because people have a wide, there's a wide
desire, like I'm a very tart apple.
Other people like very sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you deal with that in your
selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, how do you deal with
that some, like 70% of the population
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to like a sweet apple where 30%
tends to like the tart apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we deal with that in our breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think consumers, if they're exposed to
something outside of their comfort zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: will embrace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think especially, we're losing a
lot of the kid market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have some robust things
that children would like more than adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm selecting a wide range of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going for middle of the road
because that's a dangerous precedent to
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've been a great audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
