[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about soil earlier,
and we talked about the community soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: community being a type of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you begin to plant the garden,
it illustrates the importance of helping
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're working alongside a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going in to teach people how to
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you're facilitating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're creating a space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're being a resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gardening, yes, but you're also
cultivating a space for a community to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any excuse to get people just interacting
with a common context.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a great thing about
gardening, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a commitment to providing
a portion of the food to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're planting, you're thinking
about the types of foods and how the food
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be used in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you see your approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using gardening to help
communities organize and develop education
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I'm an intense gardener
myself, my grandmother was a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Haiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember my connection to the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always a healing place for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt that the children needed a
healing place because of all the trauma
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're suffering in the city that
are not accounted for, that impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior and also that also impact the
learning ability, the attention span.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided a little pilot project on my
own where I use my own money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought seeds and I bought cups and
little sticks for them to label the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I created lessons around that for them
and how they can be inspired by the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of a seed to survive no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have to go crooked to get the sun,
if they have to go under and reappear to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the water, if they're stepped on,
they'll grow flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's so inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much learning that can really
empower those children if they can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: tenacity of the dandelion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens can be used as metaphors to build
partnerships between youth and adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a garden is a great place to bring
in two generations of people to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: building community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
you
