[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell

[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Frank Rossi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to introduce myself as an urban
grassland ecologist for the purposes of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, the earth is warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, as we've seen and Grant showed,
moving into cities at rapid rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a good thing because then we only
mess up small amounts of area every place
[SPEAKER_00]: we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to mess things up as a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we know is as
we move into these urban environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know my colleague Nina Bassack has
been barking about this for 40 years and
[SPEAKER_00]: hardly anybody's been listening,
but it's very important to have plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: green infrastructures in these systems,
as Yoshi said very well to start us off
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not growing food, but supplying us in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that we have
these green infrastructures there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is people can't be trusted to
take care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mismatch managed nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mow improperly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't steward the water resource
exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enormous amounts of emissions
associated with their use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how to deal with organic
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind their adherence to pest
management principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these improper practices are all
leading to a reduction in ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is fundamentally where
there's no longer a laughing matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: How these landscapes provide and regulate
and support, and in my perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: offer all these cultural services,
the human well-being, the recreation that
[SPEAKER_00]: urban grasslands can provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our research is focusing on diversified
plantings, mixing C3 and C4 plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: lawns in hopes that it can be a little bit
smarter when the water comes and goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is to take the people out,
because in my opinion they can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: trusted, is to automate those landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, as the $6 million man who's
old enough, anybody my age would remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that television show, we have the
technology to do this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of making it work and
systematizing it so that it works on a
[SPEAKER_00]: smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have an array of robotic mowing
technologies and an array of irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture sensing technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to hand the keys of the mowing
over to the robot, which will be much
[SPEAKER_00]: better than a regular person mowing,
and turn the keys of the irrigation system
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the soil moisture sensors after
they're calibrated so that the water can
[SPEAKER_00]: be applied properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in conjunction, what that will then
lead to is sort of like driverless cars,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The roads are going to have to be a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roads will be used more efficiently
and will all be quite a bit safer when
[SPEAKER_00]: humans aren't driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my hope, just like it might be
illegal someday to drive a car,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's illegal to mow your lawn.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
