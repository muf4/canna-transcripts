[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very generous introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the decades, I've been astounded
repeatedly by the discoveries that reveal
[SPEAKER_00]: layers of sophisticated mechanisms that
have evolved to regulate transcription of
[SPEAKER_00]: our genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transcription needs to be orchestrated
at our 20,000 or so mRNA encoding genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also at the tRNAs, the ribosomal RNA
genes, the long non-coding RNAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the divergent transcripts that we now know
are associated with many promoters and
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancers, regulatory enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pattern of transcription is not
static in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But response to a spectrum of signals,
including those developmental signals that
[SPEAKER_00]: take us from a fertilized egg to an adult
or a seed to a plant, signals that occur
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to changes in nutrition or the
environment, and of course, changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur in response to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this regulatory specificity relies very
heavily on a large number of short DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence elements that interact with
hundreds of factors, transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, broken factors, either directly
or indirectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these sequence elements reside
in this region very close to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene begins, transcription starts,
called core promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These elements interact with a set of
general transcription factors that direct
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase to the proper point of
initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there are elements that
reside further upstream and provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical complement for the binding of
other regulatory factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These elements in the factors can
sometimes be in large clusters that can
[SPEAKER_00]: reside large distances from the position
of the gene, sometimes over a million
[SPEAKER_00]: bases away, and still influence the
transcription at the gene target rather
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it was thought initially that these
regulatory factors might affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: recruitment or the activation of
polymerase directly by direct
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more often than not, we now know that
there are co-regulators, often
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-subunit complexes, that the
regulatory factors interact with,
[SPEAKER_00]: be they nearby or at enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These come in several flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those types of co-regulatory
factors are the mediator, which is this
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-some subunit complex that where
different factors can plug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other subunits that then
interact with the polymerase itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are HATs, histone
acetyltransferases, modified chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are remodelers that can push
nucleosomes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of these subunits are part of
co-regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They not only influence polymerase in its
activity, the recruitment of polymerase in
[SPEAKER_00]: its activity, but they can also influence
the chromatin structure, making it a
[SPEAKER_00]: better or worse place for transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there are insulators,
these mysterious, still mysterious
[SPEAKER_00]: components that restrict where enhancers
broadcast their signal to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want genes activated
willy-nilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the insulator helps prevent activation
of improper genes and also, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: helps direct the enhancer to its proper
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to, well, to understand
regulation and how it works
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanistically, we need to know all of
these elements and factors and their
[SPEAKER_00]: interplay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to know what steps in the
transcription cycle of rate limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the slow steps that are
accelerated by regulatory signals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are multiple points in the
transcription cycle, from chromatin
[SPEAKER_00]: opening to the pre-initiation complex
formation, initiation, the motor proximal
[SPEAKER_00]: pausing, release from pausing,
productive elongation, termination,
[SPEAKER_00]: and finally, the recycling of the
polymerase to another round of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are transcription factors
associated with the DNA either nearby or
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancers that can influence this process
and influence any of these steps in
[SPEAKER_00]: principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it seems like the early steps in
transcription are what's primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, over the years, became fascinated,
or some would argue, obsessed with this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon of promoter proximal pausing,
which happened later than what textbooks
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you where regulation should be
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it involves, after polymerase
initiates, we find that polymerase has
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to a few tens of bases, to a pause
site, and can hang out there for some
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A period of time, getting a proper signal,
then the polymerase can be released into
[SPEAKER_00]: productive elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just blow that area up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see it a little more
clearly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is pausing taking place where there
are specific factors involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirteen complexes, NELF and BSIF,
that help stabilize the pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably interactions between the
polymerase and the general transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that brought the polymerase there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably, we think, keep the
polymerase from readily leaving the locus
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping to stabilize the pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there's probably some
component of regulation at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pause sites that are due to the barrier
caused by nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon activation of genes, we have
factors that can bring in a kinase that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a rather famous kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rather a lot of major changes
that take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the most significant changes is
the recruitment of a PTFB kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can phosphorylate these pausing
factors and the polymerase itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing NELF to leave, DSIF to be
transformed to an elongation factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and polymerase now to change its
modification state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can then take on a new entourage of
factors that help it with its movement
[SPEAKER_00]: through these vast distances, through the
genes and chromatin, but also coordinate
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcription with co-transcriptional
RNA processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so shortly after arriving at Cornell
back in the dark ages in 78, I started
[SPEAKER_00]: dreaming about ways of dissecting how
eukaryotic mechanisms work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it would be worth looking in
the natural context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people were doing a strict
biochemical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a biochemistry section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked pure proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to work on dirty whole
cell methodologies and try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought this would complement the
traditional biochemical approaches where
[SPEAKER_00]: people were purifying all the components
involved in transcription and then trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to reconstruct the process in a test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the years, our laboratory has
emphasized an embarrassingly simple
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple-minded approach of simply
taking live cells, observing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: perturbing them, and then re-observing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our reasoning is that we could look at
genes and genomes and transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors and the polymerase, the machine of
transcription itself, and the nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could look at these at the highest
possible resolution, both spatial and
[SPEAKER_00]: temporal, we might be able to learn
something about transcription and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least put some limits on models
that we're considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could perturb this process
either by turning on or pressing genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive specific signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could also make mutants in
transcription factors or do RNAi or drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that inhibit particular components,
RNA aptamers that might interfere with
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecular interactions or use of
degrons to get rid of proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and thereby perturb the process in a very
specific way, and then re-observe as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible after the perturbation to see
what the immediate effect, the first-order
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, of these perturbations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can't always do these assays
immediately after with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: perturbations, but some of them you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outline of the talk today is that
we're going to try and cover the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: shock as a model system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start off an optical
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be easy to take, I think,
for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to have movies and
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Promote proximal pausing is the second
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it's a critical step in
expression of Drosophila in the mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, very broadly a critical step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we'll do a genome-wide
analysis of transcription regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms in Drosophila, but also mouse
and human, and drill down a little bit in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so heat shock response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we picked the Drosophila system as a
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Dave Hogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reasons where the genes are
robustly activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many genes induce 200-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a sloppy biochemist and still
get a decent result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response is rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens within tens of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a synchronous activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can watch things as they happen,
as a function of time, and see as factors
[SPEAKER_00]: get recruited and machinery goes through
the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sets certain limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what those factors might be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principles and underlying mechanisms
are proving to be general, much more
[SPEAKER_00]: general than I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, polythene chromosomes of
flies and certain tissues provide a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: amplified signal and resolution to look at
the chromosomes and look at active
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription as it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heat shock response, we've learned
a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In uninduced cells, you'll see evidence
that this polymerase already present on
[SPEAKER_00]: the uninduced promoter, not on the gene
body, but on the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's work from the Honda lab shows that
there's NELF and DSIF associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilizing that POS polymerase,
the general transcription factors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a GAGA factor that you'll hear
more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a master regulatory protein,
heat shock factor, that doesn't associate
[SPEAKER_00]: very strongly with the uninduced gene or
at its heat shock elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upon heat shock, it trimerizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds very tightly to the activated
genes or enhancers that are nearby the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this recruits the PTFB kinase,
which then allows this POS polymerase now
[SPEAKER_00]: to escape very rapidly, about once every
six seconds, so that the polymerases are
[SPEAKER_00]: stacked on the gene about as tightly as
they can go in response to heat shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just start by going through an
optical observation of how this and how
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was facilitated, as I mentioned,
because of polythene chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the salivary glands, these chromosomes
have undergone 10 rounds of duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have 1,000 chromatids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they remain aligned in an interphase
extended state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take on structure that we can see
here for bands and interbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can know where you are on the
chromosome, what loci and genes are next
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these chromosomes come from these
salivary gland cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you break open the cells and spread
the chromosomes, you now have these dead
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes that you can look at,
which are very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a mitotic chromosome on the same
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see these are really giant,
wonderful structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fascinated by these immensely when I
started working in Drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still am, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a collaboration with Watt Webb's
group, a number of you may remember his
[SPEAKER_00]: great contributions to the optical science
here at Cornell, we had a joint student,
[SPEAKER_00]: J.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yao, who we decided it would be
interesting to take a look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: polythene chromosomes using two-photon
laser scanning microscopy, a technology
[SPEAKER_00]: they had working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on that week, he came back with
these pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So optical sections take in every half
micron sections through a salivary gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see going from one end to the
other, you get this fantastic view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice that you could begin mapping
particular chromosomal sites even in this
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this optical section approach worked
pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could identify specific loci,
which meant that you could, in principle,
[SPEAKER_00]: track the recruitment and dynamics and
interactions of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like GFP tag proteins, that's specific
native loci in real time in living cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the operation can be done with lasers,
this two-photon laser scanning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also get comparable results and
faster with a state of the art spinning
[SPEAKER_00]: disk microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Katie Zobeck and Buckley went down
and collected a lot of data of this sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we use in this is we have two
matched lenses, one at 22 degrees and one
[SPEAKER_00]: at 37, the heat shock temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can then make a variety of
transgenic fly lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a variety of lines that have GFP
and RFP tag transcription factors and
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the various combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, at 22 degrees, you take optical
stacks of the green and the red channels
[SPEAKER_00]: to get two proteins mapped simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can shift the lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the heat capacity of the lens is such
that we know from
[SPEAKER_00]: direct measurements that the salivary
gland increases temperature in about six
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can begin immediately watching the
time course of gene activation caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: this warm lens that activates gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just show you a set of movies
that are synchronized here that have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can watch, heat shock factor,
Paul II, PTFB, kinase, that famous kinase
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned to you, elongation factor,
SPD6, and the topoisomerase one,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of which get recruited upon heat shock
to major heat shock loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to follow a couple of major
heat shock loci, the ones that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: HSB70 genes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let me start this movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to stop it really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the view at 18 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's already a signal that begins
showing up with the master regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: protein heat shock factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not there at the beginning,
or very low at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upon heat shock, it gets recruited,
saturates in about two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Paul II starts coming in,
along with PTFB kinase, and then these
[SPEAKER_00]: other elongation factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just plotted out the results from
many, many nuclei and actually multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: salivary glands showing the standard
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a highly reproducible,
highly synchronized process.
[SPEAKER_00]: HSF saturates by two minutes, followed by
polymerase and PTFB, and then the other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from this kind of analysis,
we know that the activation is of
[SPEAKER_00]: different nuclei and polythene cells is
synchronous.
[SPEAKER_00]: HSF is rapidly recruited to heat shock
loci within 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saturates by two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's followed by this Paul II and
PTFB kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, this shows that transcription
factors are assembled on these heat shock
[SPEAKER_00]: genes rather than heat shock genes being
transported to some factory, as some
[SPEAKER_00]: models profess, that you move genes around
to places that are transcribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we think, at least in these
systems, that you assemble the factory at
[SPEAKER_00]: the site of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in part two here, we're going to
investigate promotoproximal pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start by examining the very
early biochemical evidence for pausing
[SPEAKER_00]: that got me into this and got our lab into
this problem of studying this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional control that was not
appreciated at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first experiments that led us to
the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over four experiments
extremely quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're published a long time ago,
so if you want to read more about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me just give you the essence of
these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a UV chip experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross-linking
immunoprecipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worked by Dave Gilmore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the first of these
cross-linking immunoprecipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It later became chip experiments,
chip seek, and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was a precursor of those kinds of
experiments that then Varshavsky adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It told us we decided to look at RNA
polymerase itself, both before and after
[SPEAKER_00]: heat shock, because we thought that would
be a good way to develop this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before heat shock, polymerase covered the
entire gene, but in the uninduced gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase was also giving a signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing restriction digestion and
probing the DNA that co-precipitates when
[SPEAKER_00]: we, after cross-linking and
immunoprecipitation, were able to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: that polymerase to between minus 12 and
plus 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at high concentrations, we estimated
one polymerase per gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the status of that polymerase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it simply be bound to the promoter?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclear run-on experiments done by Anne
Rugby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showed that you could block new initiation
with high concentrations of salt or a
[SPEAKER_00]: soccer seal, and release this polymerase
into elongation in a nuclear run-on
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make that polymerase move and
incorporate radioactive nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that those polymerases
map to this same region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precisely where they map was done by Eric
Rasmussen, where he fished out these RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: and sized them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we checked in vivo by
completely orthogonal method, using
[SPEAKER_00]: permanganate, potassium permanganate,
which maps single-stranded T's in these
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that there were
hypersensitive T's associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter region, even in non-heat shock
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of this data points to this
polymerase in this model I've shown here,
[SPEAKER_00]: has engaged in transcription, made a short
RNA of 20 to 50 nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's paused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be made to transcribe in the
presence of soccer seal or high salt that
[SPEAKER_00]: removes some of the, we know, extracts
some of the barriers that keep it paused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these targeted studies in the 80s and
90s were kind of ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, in the early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was because the field was focused
on yeast as a model system in
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription, which does not show
pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gone back with some of our
genome-wide methods now and show that
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast does the cyclomyces cerevisiae does
not show pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the mid-2000s, or around 2005,
we were developing for some very
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated, people were developing
sophisticated genome-wide methods for
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: CHIP experiments were being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you could chromatin IP and then
probe these microarrays to cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an experiment in some of those
techniques, as you will see, were replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: by more sophisticated observation
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the early experiments by Bing
Ren done in a human lung fibroblast line,
[SPEAKER_00]: IMR90, showed that a ribosomal protein
gene, that there was polymerases piled up
[SPEAKER_00]: on the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a gene that you theoretically
that we knew is expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these reads in the gene body were
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people were surprised that there
would be so much polymerase piled up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the promoter if you were simply
transcribing this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was reminiscent of the paused
polymerase we saw in Hsp70, except it was
[SPEAKER_00]: centered right at the start site rather
than being displaced downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of other labs were also able
to see this pile up of polymerase on
[SPEAKER_00]: various promoters and various systems in
Drosophila and in other human cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked from Rick Young's lab,
Karen Edelman and Mike Levine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wondered if we could evaluate
whether this polymerase was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-initiation complex that is simply
bound or was it paused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the original papers, it was
interpreted to be a pre-initiation
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wondered if we could contribute to
this process of characterizing these
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerases on promoters genome-wide by
developing a new method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Leighton Core, who was an extremely
talented grad student at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to take on this project of
developing something that we now call
[SPEAKER_00]: GROSSEQ, Global Run-on Sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you isolate nuclei, you have
polymerases on genes, some of them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: pause site, some of them on the gene body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to let those polymerases run
on in the presence of nucleotides,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, a nucleotide that has an
affinity tag like bromo-UTP.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are antibodies to bromo-UTP that you
can use then to fish out what we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: nascent RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these bromo-Us incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you control run on 100 bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then isolate the RNA, base
hydrolyze that down to 100 bases so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can map precisely where the polymerase
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is followed by these affinity
purifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: At each step of the library preparation,
there are three purifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spike-in controls tell us that there's
about nearly a million-fold purification
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nascent RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it provides a very clean source of
mapping where polymerase is precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make a library, and then you
sequence heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was our first look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember this arriving one night,
one afternoon, and it was a disk full of
[SPEAKER_00]: things on a disk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were trying to figure out how to
get a look at what this was telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of the night, fortunately,
we had Josh Waterfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a physicist who could handle this
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the night, we had these
browser shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very, very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the pattern of transcription of
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see genes going left to right are
shown in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right to left are in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this pattern over this 2.5
megabase region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the genes stand out very
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could get a close-up view by
expanding this little region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can take a look at a single gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this in, well, in fibroblast,
the same experiment that Bing Ren did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the same cell line that Bing Ren
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Bing Ren's data showing the
chip-chip results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the Grosseq results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there's a striking
peak of paused polymerase just down the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: One stream from the transcription start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another pause going in the
opposite direction that surprised us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's turned out to be general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polymerase is going the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sum of the two gives us polymerase
that's centered on the transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't look like it was paused in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indeed, it's paused in both
directions, polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a surprising feature of
the architecture of mammalian promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, it's general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see in this metagene analysis,
we're lining up genes left to right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see in the red direction,
we're looking at the transcription of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, on average, very striking pausing
taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gene body levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this upstream antisense
transcription, even if we remove any
[SPEAKER_00]: upstream genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a feature of promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the majority of promoters show pause,
Paul, too, in both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked in Drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a similar pausing going on,
striking paused genes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some genes don't show pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority greater than 70% of genes
show some significant pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Drosophila, there isn't divergent
transcription at promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drosophila is a little smarter than we
are, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they send polymerase in the correct
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end, if you're interested in how flies
are so smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to reiterate what these patterns
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this green is the density of
polymerase, we see that there's a pileup
[SPEAKER_00]: of polymerase at this pause site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we interpret that is that there
are factors that recruit the polymerase
[SPEAKER_00]: with this big arrow showing that
recruitment's efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The release and the productive elongation
is less efficient, this small green arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a pileup of polymerases
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some gene body level that we
can detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a gene is activated,
maybe new factors bind and bring in this
[SPEAKER_00]: PTFE kinase and allow then the increased
escape or release and the productive
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene body level can go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we were curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should add that there are these very
specific inhibitors to this PTFE kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what fraction of the genes are
dependent upon this PTFE kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: this pause and release step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Iris Yonkers, in mouse ES cells,
then decided to add this PTFE kinase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitor and look at how the pattern is
the normal pattern of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if we now block this
with flavor pyridol?
[SPEAKER_00]: How will it change this pattern of
transcription we see here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking just at the reads in the no
flavor pyridol case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pileup of polymerases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these lines represents a
separate gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the pileup of polymerases in
both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And upon flavor pyridol treatment,
if we block the release, we should see the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene body go down, the pausing perhaps go
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, this is what she saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we compare the 50 minutes relative to
no flavor pyridol, the change that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a log 10 scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the gene body goes down
dramatically on all genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as pausing goes up on most genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true for the antisense
orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just an example gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene we wouldn't call as paused
because it's not obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you add flavor pyridol and watch
with time, you can see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcribing polymerase is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they clear in this wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually measure the rate of that
wave movement and get elongation rates for
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 genes at a time by this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can now see that this gene piles up
polymerase at the pause site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, virtually greater than 95% of
genes behave in this way, where they seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to be going through this pause release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step even if the pause isn't detectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a general mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collusions part two is most mammalian
Drosophila genes exhibit promote proximal
[SPEAKER_00]: pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All active genes undergo a pause release
that is dependent on this PTFE kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last section we'll go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hanging in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fasten your seatbelts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to now look at, in that case,
what can we learn from this beyond what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just told you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Fabiana Duarte decided to extend
this and Drosophila looking more broadly
[SPEAKER_00]: at the heat chart response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, we also made use of a
technology that was developed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating grad student who's now a
professor here, Hojoon Kwak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he took Grossseq and made it and
provided base pair resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developed it to a base pair resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So precision run-on sequencing,
or ProSeq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way this works is that we
incorporate, instead of a BromoU,
[SPEAKER_00]: a biotin NTP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that chokes the polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just back off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is the biotin gets
incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that chokes the polymerase,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are only biotin nucleotides
present, you add one biotin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that marks the 3 prime end of where
polymerase was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can put linkers on and
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you sequence from the 3 prime end,
you get the base pair precision where the
[SPEAKER_00]: active site of polymerase is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density of polymerase genome-wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome-wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ProSeq features are very much like
Grossseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just reiterate these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get a distribution of
transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These provide kinetic snapshots that are
not affected by the background of
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: One can measure gene expression by mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to see changes that
happen, you have to wait for those pools
[SPEAKER_00]: to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, you can look directly right
at the gene and see what happens in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute or two by these methods to assess
the changes that are either up or down in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strand-specific assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dynamic range of nearly six
orders of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: ProSeq differs from Grossseq in that it's
base pair resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more robust and easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you have tried Grossseq and
you said, I'll never try this again,
[SPEAKER_00]: try ProSeq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be newer methods coming out
that we're promising will be a half-day
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold me to half-day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what some of former students
are arguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hope was that by using ProSeq,
it's high resolution and sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could provide a very fine-grained
panorama of the changes in transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: across the genome in response to
regulatory signals, allowing insights into
[SPEAKER_00]: the steps in transcription that are
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look at heat shock genes
and heat shock response and watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome as it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took trisophila cells,
cell cultures, did a heat shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then took samples at 30 seconds,
two minutes, five minutes, 10 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 minutes, and then did ProSeq.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replicates, we did replicates,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was work Fabiano Duarte with some
help from Mike Gertin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these good high correlations
between replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then begin looking at the
difference between the zero time point,
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-heat shock, and the various time
points here to see when differences
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that by five minutes,
there are some differences that begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 20 minutes, we have many hundreds of
genes in pink here that are activated,
[SPEAKER_00]: many thousands of genes that are
downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just examples of the kinetics
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this increased transcription
within the course of this 20 minutes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the upregulated gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, with comparable kinetics,
a downregulation of transcription on those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genes that are turned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major heat shock genes that we were
all interested in all show pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that the level of pausing is
generally high on the heat shock activated
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were wondering, what are the factors
that caused that pausing, that set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: pause to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the factors that jumped out at
us was GAGA factor, which we had
[SPEAKER_00]: previously shown was associated with
activated genes, as did Levine lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: Gilmore lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was rich, certainly, on HSB70,
but it was also rich on other paused genes
[SPEAKER_00]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at where GAGA factor is
on the heat shock activated genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do this analysis as to where do we find
a GAGA factor binding site.
[SPEAKER_00]: By GAGA factor chip, signals, that is the
real binding sites, where do they occur
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the transcription site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they occur largely before the first
100 bases upstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that this 70% of the genes
have a GAGA factor associated with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the activated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to go much further out to find
them in the case of repressed or unchanged
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look by just a meta gene analysis,
where the GAGA factor is and how abundant
[SPEAKER_00]: it is in these various classes,
we see on the activated genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's high and just upstream from the
transcription start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 75% of the activated genes seem to have
this GAGA factor bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is this related to GAGA factor's role
in pausing and heat shock activation?
[SPEAKER_00]: To test that more directly, we did one of
these perturbations, where Fabiano did a
[SPEAKER_00]: GAGA factor RNAi, compared it to a control
lacZ, plus and minus heat shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then did proceed in all samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the knockdown does need work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shown by this quantitative Western.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get different classes of genes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two I want to focus on is this red
class, where we look at the GAGA factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lacZ RNAi ratio on the gene body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, where has a GAGA factor knockdown
led to a decrease in gene body
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are genes that show decreased
transcription, but also have GAGA factor
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is a purple class,
where GAGA factor is bound, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, these heat shock activated genes,
don't show any decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about GAGA factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have these two distinct classes,
those that care about GAGA factor for
[SPEAKER_00]: expression and those that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can now look at how is that related
to the pausing that's caused upon GAGA
[SPEAKER_00]: factor knockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take these GAGA factor dependent heat
shock inducible genes, shown in red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that in the GAGA factor RNAi
knockdown, we have a decrease in pausing,
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic decrease in pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at this other class,
the purple class, upon GAGA factor
[SPEAKER_00]: knockdown, there's no change in pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this in browser shots as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the pause polymerase, GAGA factor
knockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lose the pause polymerase control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see gene activation upon heat shock,
but we fail to see that heat shock
[SPEAKER_00]: activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so GAF is needed for activation on
those genes where GAGA factor is also
[SPEAKER_00]: needed for pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this independent class where
GAGA factor is bound, where pausing nor
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription depends on GAGA factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something else must be substituting for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's first deal with how GAGA factor
is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was studies in the past by Karl Wu
that showed that there were associations
[SPEAKER_00]: of GAGA factor with a remodeler,
a nucleosome remodeler, which made some
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that remodel is called NERF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea being that maybe GAGA factor
interacts with NERF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that clears open a promoter,
allowing polymerase to enter at this very
[SPEAKER_00]: early step to create the recruited
polymerase and the pause site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistent with that are recent studies by
Julius Judd, a new student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lab has shown that by ChIP-seq or
a related version of that assay called Cut
[SPEAKER_00]: and Run, we can make map polymerase on
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see where the GAGA factor is
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see then where that NERF tends
to co-localize with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consistent with the model, we find NERF
localizing with GAGA factor in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then tested the effects of a GAGA
factor knockdown genome-wide on
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we clearing nucleosomes with GAGA
factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we knockdown GAGA factor,
we see nucleosomes filling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do that, we can map where
nucleosomes are with this enzyme called
[SPEAKER_00]: micrococonuclease, digests away the DNA
that isn't protected by the nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we now take that DNA and do a
paired-end sequence from each side,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get the position of where every
nucleosome is in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does get a measure of nucleosome
occupancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nucleosomes tend to be depleted at
promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that in two classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A knockdown with just a lacZ, where we see
those that show reduced pausing still have
[SPEAKER_00]: this open promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are unaffected by the GAGA
factor knockdown are also behaving
[SPEAKER_00]: similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we now knockdown GAGA factor,
what happens is nucleosomes fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fill in over the promoter region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GAGA factor seems to be needed to keep
this region free of nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the model, here we have factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this open promoter, GAGA factor,
NERF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open the promoter, allowing polymerase to
create the paused polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon heat shock, we now have the
polymerase firing.
[SPEAKER_00]: HSF1 binds, brings in, we think,
p-def-p kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know p-def-p kinase allows the firing
of polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a full response.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the GAGA factor depletion, we block the
process at an early stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that, nucleosomes can fill in on these
promoters, block formation of paused
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these genes are no longer activatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mentioned that there are promoters
that are GAGA factor independent of
[SPEAKER_00]: pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they show association with a second
factor, M1bp, that had been characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: by Dave Gilmore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, these are dependent on M1bp
for both pausing and heat shock
[SPEAKER_00]: activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two different proteins that
can set up the pause and act, as we think,
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow then the activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why pause, you might ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's all this wasted effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: One reason is, we think, is GAGA factor,
while it helps keep nucleosomes off,
[SPEAKER_00]: a polymerase is a great foot in the door
of chromatin, keeping this region open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, Karen Edelman's lab has found
that the paused polymerase itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you disrupt it, you can see nucleosomes
filling in on many promoters as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping this open may be very critical
in early development, especially in flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where genes are turned on very
rapidly in very specific stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Levine, Mike Levine, has shown very
nicely that this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the genes that prescribe this
early embryonic development show striking
[SPEAKER_00]: pausing and require that pausing for their
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another reason I think we have pausing
is because it gives us two steps which to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this GAGA factor working at
this first step, allowing the recruitment
[SPEAKER_00]: by opening up the chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once polymerase is recruited,
we know it moves very quickly to the pause
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see initiation being rate
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a second factor, heat shock
factor, we postulate then has the ability,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know it has the ability, to bring in P
to Fb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that influences the second step of
pause escape, pause release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it causes the phosphorylation of these
components, and now polymerase can
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us two different factors that
can operate in a synergistic way on an
[SPEAKER_00]: event that has certain advantages to
getting high dynamic range, but also a way
[SPEAKER_00]: of interpreting regulatory signals and
integrating those signals to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific kind of response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's why you might be having
factors working at distinct stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is HSF1 really working at this stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've examined HSF dependent heat
shock activated genes, looking at their
[SPEAKER_00]: response in a controlled knockdown,
lacZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see, before heat shock,
we get this pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after heat shock, this set of genes
shows, on average, this increased
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription, which you'd expect from a
heat shock gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we knock down HSF1, this pausing
is still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see in Drosophila, and we see this
decrease in gene body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we interpret that to mean that HSF1 is
working at the second step of releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the polymerase in the productive
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you block it, you don't have HSF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock it down, you can't do that
second step.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So historically, this has been an area
where a lot of attention has been focused
[SPEAKER_00]: for regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that there are really two major
steps, step of recruitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once recruited, polymerase moves very
quickly to the pause site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is regulated by gaga factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have release of pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regulated by other kinds,
many, many kinds of transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: including heat shock factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this in mouse and human cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just skip this next bit
and go right to the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have only a few minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll skip the very end bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for the guys who are doing the
aptamer technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it takes a full hour.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look now in mouse and human behave
very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene body on heat shock, we look at
this full change on genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see their increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are HSF1-dependent genes that
have HSF1 bound to their promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that in an HSF1 minus minus,
a knockout of this master regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, we don't see this activation of
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene body transcription needs
HSF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look at the pause region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pause region in mammals also goes up,
unlike Drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's independent, though, however,
of HSF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our model is this, that upon heat
shock, we have this increase in release.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HSF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we flood the gene with polymerases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have an increase, somewhat
increase, of pause polymerase formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's HSF1-independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this happens at promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're seeing that there are enhancers
that are also activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not all heat shock-activated genes
have HSF1 bound close to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, they're HSF1-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the HSF must be acting at a distance,
because there's no HSF1 bound near it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that HSF1 is part of enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can find these globally by looking
in non-heat shock and heat shock and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing these sites of transcriptional
activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that enhancers, when they get
activated, it's another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when enhancers get activated,
they show increased divergent
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription, much like we see on
mammalian primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In motors, HSF1 is associated with those
activated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're just looking at the changes in
gene body transcription, gene
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that tend to go up in heat shock
tend to have HSF1 associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, the transcription we see at
enhancers is often associated with HSF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of gray dots here,
which represent cases where we see
[SPEAKER_00]: increased transcription, but no HSF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the model I want to leave you with
here is the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of transcribed genes are
turned down in response to heat shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have just massive repression of
thousands of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's repressed at the step of
pause-release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like activation is influencing
pause-release, the inhibition leaves us
[SPEAKER_00]: with a pause polymerase and the
polymerases that we're transcribing clear
[SPEAKER_00]: and enter a pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those that are primed for activation
in response to heat shock, after heat
[SPEAKER_00]: shock, HSF1 binds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the increased transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think this pool of polymerases
that's coming from these mammalian,
[SPEAKER_00]: often very long genes, lots of polymerase
start filling in and help the induced
[SPEAKER_00]: genes stay active.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see increased transcription upon heat
shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those are HSF1 bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see increased transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are others that show no HSF1
there that also show increased
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lineage-specific factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have factors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't have heat shock factor
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these go up, we think, because of mass
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these polymerases being
contributed from this pool of repressed
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that now are filling by mass action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to test that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to say that we've been
working for 25 years on RNA aptamers,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to develop these as ways of
interfering with macromolecular
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, because most of biology is
driven by large macromolecular contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could get big inhibitors that
could interfere with protein-protein
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions or protein-nucleic acid
interactions, then we'd have the power to
[SPEAKER_00]: really begin testing a lot of our models
much more rigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these aptamers could be very useful as
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select RNA aptamers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can envision you could block one
surface of a protein without destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the potential to act quickly,
disrupt macromolecular interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially have a high success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that the way you get
aptamers is by a process called CLEX,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm not going to have time to go
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, you select the binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then reselect the binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do 8 to 20 cycles of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you burn out a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, you'll get an aptam with
high affinity for a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the past few years, Abdullah Ozer
and our Harold Craighead's group are
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating to improve all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've improved both the RNA library.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a library about 10 to the 16th,
and then 70 mores now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've improved partitioning approaches,
which I really won't go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see now we can scale up to
something like 96 of these at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to start churning these out in
massive ways on targeting transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors and other factors of all sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, barcoding and Illumina
sequencing takes the expense out of
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizing 96 of these at a time if
one wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shown you them 28 at a time in a
single lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing this, we're targeting our major
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Judy G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray has recently had some huge success
with the DSIF aptamer and the analysis by
[SPEAKER_00]: Abdullah Ozer in that we can have an
aptamer that binds very tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where the region where it does
bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can then show in collaboration
with Dave Gilmore that this aptamer
[SPEAKER_00]: interferes with the ability of this DSIF,
this pausing factor to interfere with the
[SPEAKER_00]: binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In polymerase, here we see a band shift
showing the binding of DSIF and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that an aptamer will block that even if
added after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the last slide here I'll
show you is the last data slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we now express these in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a control aptamer shows this
pausing and this gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcription right to left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is left to right in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that this is reproducible
upon aptamer addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a decrease in pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is reproducible in this replica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an even more dramatic change,
loss of the pause site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's reproducible in replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see many genes change, 220.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them show this decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some show shifts or deep increases,
but also shifts in pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As though the pausing is disrupted at one
site and maybe piling up at another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in the early analysis of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say, in conclusion,
that transcription factors can act to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish pause polymerase or release
pause polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaga factor I can first, HSF1 acting
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect this is a general model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most active enhancers are divergently
transcribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The massive heat track down regulation
releases all two that loads on promoters
[SPEAKER_00]: by mass action, feeding both the activated
stress gene and, I think, priming the
[SPEAKER_00]: response to normality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding the promoters open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding the enhancers open by this
polymerase filling at the promoters of
[SPEAKER_00]: both enhancers and gene promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then RNA aptamers, I'm arguing,
I hope, will serve as large drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be general and allow us to interrupt
transcription in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank all people in my
group, and especially the Saints who were
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for this particular work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that the others are sinners,
but they're doing different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I went over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give quick answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there are core promoters for both of
those in both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll find them at both promoters and
enhancers in mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Drosophila, you have more elements that
contribute to orientation on promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so promoters tend to fire the
polymerase in one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The factors that regulate tend to be
between these transcription star sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we think enhancers, both in
mammals and Drosophila, we see enhancers
[SPEAKER_00]: have this pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the enhancer is defined by the
pause to pause region, which has the two
[SPEAKER_00]: core promoters and a cluster of
transcription factor regulatory binding
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that's the basic unit
structure of enhancers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why doesn't yeast do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's found another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all yeasts don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out POMB has something that
resembles this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no knelf in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no knelf in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at plants, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard the talks given from
Jean-Luc's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alberto, I hope some of you have heard
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cassava, there is something that looks
like pausing, just like in POMB,
[SPEAKER_00]: the yeast POMB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saccharomyces doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no knelf in either case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know if it's a real pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know in POMB, our recent studies of
that show that polymerase is moving more
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a maturation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it isn't a strict pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants also have this divergent
transcription ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enhancers, it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen that in cassava and now in
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are places where a lot of the
critical snips are located, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if there are repeated cycles
of stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there adaptation so that the pause and
pause change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I should know this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Ani here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to answer that question?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you didn't hear the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, upon repeated cycles
of heat shock, is there any adaptation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does come back to the non-heat
shock state pretty quickly and pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: completely, except for a few things that
are kind of important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go into more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The apoptosis genes tend to be primed.
[SPEAKER_03]: For hours, basically, the transomal
profile is restored.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some genes retain higher pausing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see also fast release of the
pausal reactivates, pre-heat shock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the simple answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to list that later if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hang outside the door if
people have other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I went over.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
