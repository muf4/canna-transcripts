[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah, so maybe it might be a couple of
you that have heard me talk before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've actually just had a thing for master
gardeners at Cornell on climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the kind of thing I cover now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I'll mention a little later,
I've also done work, as it was mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the New York Botanic Garden in the
Bronx with their climate change program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to mention right here at the
outset, we have a website at Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: called just pretty easy to remember,
just climatechange.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a couple of you that have
been there before.
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, I encourage you to go back again,
because it's just this last week I've
[SPEAKER_02]: released in a totally new and much ramped
up version.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a section there called up at the
top, one of the buttons is tools and
[SPEAKER_02]: resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use the scroll down,
there's a section just for gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a section just on kind of
basics of climate science, which I'll go
[SPEAKER_02]: through a little bit at the beginning
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things like Craig is videotaping this
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will probably be showing up
posted at that website, this presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's things like that to check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of good resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'll be showing some data for New
York and some analyses for New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the New York climate is likely to do,
particularly for our region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it is available at this
particular website for those of you that
[SPEAKER_02]: are interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a statewide, both Columbia and
Cornell University, pretty major project,
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a few people involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's sections on the climate for
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's section just on agriculture,
on ecosystems, on human health,
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be pulling from that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm starting with a couple of
data slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna be a whole lot of this kind
of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I talk climate change,
of course, it's a controversial issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of information out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like this graphic because it puts
things in perspective about how we live on
[SPEAKER_02]: a planet where the climate's always been
changing long before humans were here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then kind of lay over on that what the
human impact is and is projected to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: just the next 100 years or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a very long record.
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes back 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bottom trace there is the
temperatures going up and down on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: For almost half a million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: These big dips would be the ice ages that
you all would be generally familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of little ups and downs
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of what's causing all of this has
been studied for many years by planetary
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists, by meteorologists and climate
scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, one reason we have a fair
amount of confidence in the climate models
[SPEAKER_02]: we use to project future climate is that
we can do what they call hindcasting and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually predict the past if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know what's going on here and
causing some of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the big dips, the ice ages,
really have to do with an astronomical
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Earth's axis actually tilts a little
bit on a 20 to 40,000 year cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about the seasonal changes
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some other cycles that happen
on a 100,000 year basis that form some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these big dips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll see how these,
there's two greenhouse gases, so-called
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse gases that are in our
atmosphere that play a role today as they
[SPEAKER_02]: have in the past in warming our planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Methane, CH4 and CO2 is carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see how they kind of track all of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes those gases are responding
to the temperature change and other times
[SPEAKER_02]: they're driving the temperature change.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, when due to the planetary
astronomical changes, we start coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of a ice age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice these take a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, keep in mind the time scale here,
it takes like 10 to 20,000 years for us to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of an ice age.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last ice age was about 20,000 years
ago and we came out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, as the planet starts to warm
because of the planetary motions and tilt
[SPEAKER_02]: is changing, that tends to melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, permafrost, which holds a lot
of material that when it warms up and
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria start working on it, releases
methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just really feeds forward on itself
and speeds up this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the warming is faster than
the cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, and then as volcanoes erupt or
whatever where they might produce CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: even before there were humans on the
planet, that would tend to cause little
[SPEAKER_02]: ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you notice here 10,000 years ago,
only 10,000 years ago, still very few
[SPEAKER_02]: people on the planet, but that's about
when crop domestication started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, as you can see, we came up out
of a very cold period and reached a
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively stable period called the
Holocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: This certainly was considered by most
anthropologists to be one of the leading
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons why the human population has
skyrocketed since that time, in part due
[SPEAKER_02]: to crop domestication, starting with
gardening and then into farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we reached the stable period.
[SPEAKER_02]: To put some of my next slides into
perspective, notice that over about 10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: years, 15,000 years, as we came out of
that ice age, the temperature went up
[SPEAKER_02]: about 8 to 10 degrees centigrade in that
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're right about here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my next slide, I'm going to show
where we're going in probably the next 100
[SPEAKER_02]: years or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me show you something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the CO2 trace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice for the past half a million years,
the carbon dioxide has been going up and
[SPEAKER_02]: down between about 200 and 280 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my next graph shows just the CO2 thing,
but on a different y-axis scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I have to show what's going to
happen in the future, and it's going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: way up, as you might be expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's that same CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: The x-axis is exactly the same,
going back 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the CO2 going up and down between
200 and 280 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know about the old CO2 because we have
done these ice cores all around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go around the world, and they
actually capture the air bubbles at
[SPEAKER_02]: different depths in the ice, and they
measure the CO2 in those bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we know what the CO2
concentrations were years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know what it is because we have a
huge network around the globe of infrared
[SPEAKER_02]: gas analyzers that measure the CO2 in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just since the Industrial
Revolution, this is what's happened to the
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've gone way off already,
quite a ways off anything we've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the scary part is, with what's
happened so far, the planet has warmed on
[SPEAKER_02]: average almost a degree centigrade,
or about a degree and a half Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the next 100 years,
here's what's projected, based on current
[SPEAKER_02]: fossil fuel emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the magnitude of that CO2 rise,
and also the expected corresponding
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature rise, is the kind of
temperature change that typically with
[SPEAKER_02]: those ice ages we see over 10,000 years,
but now happening in 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what kind of has people
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, this is the so-called,
usually we present climate data on sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: two different scenarios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, not changing much in what we're
doing in terms of fossil fuel use,
[SPEAKER_02]: and greenhouse gases go to the atmosphere,
and one moving towards a different
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what this kind of illustrates,
I think, is even in the best case
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario, we're going to have some
adapting to do to some climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardeners and farmers and basically every
business and every person out there be a
[SPEAKER_02]: little, and every natural species out
there have some adjusting to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we want to do, though, is hopefully
get into a mitigation mode so we don't go
[SPEAKER_02]: way up there, because way up there,
obviously, the harder it gets,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get to a point where it's very
difficult to adapt and very costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is maybe getting down to
something that's a little more familiar to
[SPEAKER_02]: you, the plant hardiness zone maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume many of you are familiar
with this, the kind of things you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: at gardens and centers, a color-coded map
based on how cold it gets, the coldest it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets in the winter in different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, of course, in the north part,
it gets colder, and that's different color
[SPEAKER_02]: code than in the south.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both these maps are designed,
built the exact same way the USDA does
[SPEAKER_02]: them, looking at the last 15 years of
weather station records for the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the same kind of weather stations that
give us our evening news.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do that, you can see that
basically we have this so-called zone
[SPEAKER_02]: creep, no matter where you live,
pretty much in the U.S., you're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer hardiness zone than you were 15,
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the one thing I've done with the
New York Botanic Garden is about six,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven years ago now, we planted a test
garden of all species that were one
[SPEAKER_02]: hardiness zone warmer than where they
were, to look at how those plants did,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're all doing okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I want to mention is,
as these zones change, it's not just what
[SPEAKER_02]: you might...
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's certainly a silver
lining to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be able to grow something in
your garden that your Aunt Rose or
[SPEAKER_02]: something grew south of you, and you
always wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you have to keep in mind that
also many insect pests and weeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, their habitable zone is
dictated by how cold it gets in the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're also moving, and there's lots
of scientific literature now showing,
[SPEAKER_02]: indeed, things are, in the natural
landscape, all kinds of living things are
[SPEAKER_02]: tracking this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing to think about when you
look at this is, while some species are
[SPEAKER_02]: moving with this, they aren't all moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some species are more mobile than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one thing we're concerned about as
ecologists is disruption of important
[SPEAKER_02]: species interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if a prey item of some
particular predator does move with the
[SPEAKER_02]: climate, but the predator can't do that,
then there would be disruption there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a natural enemy of a crop pest does not
track the pest itself, then we might have
[SPEAKER_02]: some disruption there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very concerned about those sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what really sort of gets to me,
because really my training is in plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: soil ecology, as was mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really the living world's already
responding, so forget the weather station
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can really look at,
particularly perennial plants are really
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like, in a way, very complex,
sensitive weather instruments.
[SPEAKER_02]: They integrate, first of all, the winter
temperatures, because they require a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain amount of chilling, some of you
may know, a certain amount of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures in the winter to be
hormonally primed in order to bloom in the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't get that much coolness,
they're never gonna bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other hand, of course,
then as the spring does come, they kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: keep track of the degree days,
we call it, but basically the heat units,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then that's when they bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, myself and a few other colleagues
gathered some historical records going
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the 1960s of these three species,
historical records of first bloom dates,
[SPEAKER_02]: and saw that indeed on average,
all these species are blooming several
[SPEAKER_02]: days earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the peer reviewed literature,
scientific literature is really just chock
[SPEAKER_02]: full of examples of this happening around
the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely something's happening with
our climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already mentioned this kind of,
we do worry about if the plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: blooming earlier, are the pollinators
gonna be there keeping up?
[SPEAKER_02]: And each species kind of responds a little
differently to climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could have some disruption of
species interactions, particularly for
[SPEAKER_02]: highly specialized combinations of
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a concern and something else that
ecologists are tracking.
[SPEAKER_02]: One particular thing for the Northeast is
that our winters are warming more than our
[SPEAKER_02]: annual average temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average annual temperatures are going
up, but the winters are warming more than
[SPEAKER_02]: the summers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a pretty common thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher latitude you go, the more you
see that phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the thing is that when it's
warmer in the winter, there's fewer snow
[SPEAKER_02]: cover days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about snow, it's very
reflective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the radiation sun rays coming
down during the winter, when there's snow
[SPEAKER_02]: on the ground, get reflected right back up
and don't do much heating of the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's no snow there, instead of
there's dark earth, it heats up the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a feeds forward on itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, pretty surprisingly,
over four degrees Fahrenheit warming in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Northeast since the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's based on the average December plus
January plus February temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the different dots represent the
different magnitude of warming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't put too much stock on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of variation between the
weather stations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it makes sense, some of it may
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different ways of how the weather stations
are handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't see anywhere where it's
going the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's getting any cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, it's clearly warming and
pretty dramatically in our winters.
[SPEAKER_02]: That snow cover thing, this is looking a
little bit into the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a map that kind of tries to depict
what the models predict for our future.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red zone shows the Northeast and the
average, based on the historical data,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we have historically at least 30
days of snow cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the white is showing, based on the
higher emission scenario, kind of that
[SPEAKER_02]: worst case scenario, where we would have
at least 30 days of snow cover by the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the century.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, tremendous difference in
snow cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I point out with the deer is this
isn't just a matter for those people who
[SPEAKER_02]: care about skiing and thinking,
I've got to travel a little further to do
[SPEAKER_02]: my skiing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has an impact on all kinds of
things that are really relevant to
[SPEAKER_02]: gardeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, deer, I don't need to talk to
a group of gardeners about deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of the big beneficiaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some winners and losers out there
in terms of climate change, in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the species out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moose are a big loser because they can't
handle heat at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're likely to lose any moose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will probably be very hard to find
moose in New York within a couple decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: But deer benefit tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, the warmer winters,
they like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can stay healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more than that, it's that reduction in
snow cover because they can keep eating
[SPEAKER_02]: for longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more vegetation exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's many more twins being born
and just more bigger deer populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's other reasons why they're
benefiting, but that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets even more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go into what this slide
is depicting, but except to say that one
[SPEAKER_02]: of my graduate students, for example,
looked at what happens to the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, the microbial ecology,
what happens in the soil during the winter
[SPEAKER_02]: and the microbes that are involved in
nitrogen cycling in the winter is affected
[SPEAKER_02]: by snow cover because the snow is actually
an insulating blanket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps the soil actually a little warmer
and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has big impact on all kinds of things.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warmer winters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been called out twice now by the
fruit growers associations in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: state and throughout the Northeast and in
Michigan as well to talk to them about not
[SPEAKER_02]: heat stress in their apple and wine crops,
but why they've got more freeze and frost
[SPEAKER_02]: damage in a warmer world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one example is what most of you
probably felt yourself in your own gardens
[SPEAKER_02]: just a couple of years ago when we had
apples, a true record breaker,
[SPEAKER_02]: four weeks earlier than normal bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a long window of
jeopardy of a frost event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we lost about 50 to 60% of
our apple crop across the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this premature bloom can actually cause
more frost damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few years earlier, we had big damage to
some early Merlot, some young Merlot
[SPEAKER_02]: planting, some wine grape plantings in the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other end of winter, what happened
was a very warm December and the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't harden properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had quote a normal January and
they died from freeze damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was not something I expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first got into this 20, 25 years ago,
but we now are developing a decision tool
[SPEAKER_02]: for growers on adapting to climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to do with frost prediction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of apple growers are actually
thinking about putting in different
[SPEAKER_02]: systems to protect them from frost damage,
misters and different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still kind of sticking to the New York
area and some major trends that we see
[SPEAKER_02]: that are very characteristic of our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of these bars, this goes back to like
the late 1800s, each of these bars
[SPEAKER_02]: actually represents the average for a
whole decade, that whole decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this last bar here is 2000 to
2010, 2001 to 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see a very dramatic increase
in the number of heat stress days,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically the number of days over 90
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also another unusual phenomenon that
we didn't really expect early on was
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in heavy rainfall events,
not necessarily more rain over the whole
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more of the rain that does come coming
down in heavy rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have kind of a heat stress,
but also some short term flooding events
[SPEAKER_02]: that are a challenge for our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty major thing and pretty
widespread across the Northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something we have a pretty high degree
of confidence is here to stay kind of you
[SPEAKER_02]: might say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rainfall is kind of associated with
the fact that we in a warmer world
[SPEAKER_02]: basically more of the planet's water is up
in the air as water vapor, because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer and there's more evaporation and
transpiration going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when there's an upper atmosphere
cooling event to cause rainfall,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's basically more up there to come
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit of a complicated
diagram, but I wanted to show you that
[SPEAKER_02]: despite more frequent heavy rainfall
events, we actually also will have
[SPEAKER_02]: probably more need for irrigation in the
summers in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is simply because it has to
do with the balance between warmer
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures and longer growing seasons
causing crops and natural vegetation and
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in the garden to require more
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The warmer it is, the more transpiration,
the bigger the water needs are,
[SPEAKER_02]: the longer the growing season,
the longer the plants are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of depicted here with the
showing two different climate scenarios
[SPEAKER_02]: and how much warming we might have in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the summer rainfall,
it's predicted not to change much for our
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically you can't see anything there
because there's no change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order not to have more droughts
deaths, we'd have to have enough more
[SPEAKER_02]: rainfall to keep up with the increased
temperatures, if you follow what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are a little better off,
well significantly better off than many
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the world where the rainfall
isn't staying the same at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's going way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a kind of a double whammy,
you know, warmer temperatures,
[SPEAKER_02]: more crop demand, plus you're getting much
less rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to stay about the same in
the summer, but still creates a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more drought stress than we might have
seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those things I just covered were some
things where we have quite a high degree
[SPEAKER_02]: of certainty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, things I think, you know,
when you're considering what to do in your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden, I think you can sort of count on a
lot of evidence for those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to bring up a couple of things
here that are a little less evidence and a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell you about what's
going on, but something just to put on
[SPEAKER_02]: your radar to kind of be watching the news
and see how some of this science gets
[SPEAKER_02]: resolved over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Arctic ice you may have heard on
the news is melting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might think, well, you know,
polar bears or whatever, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's not going to affect my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have found is that the melting
of the Arctic ice is having an effect on
[SPEAKER_02]: the jet stream patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's quite a consensus now among
the climate science community that the
[SPEAKER_02]: melting of the Arctic ice is changing the
jet stream patterns, where there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of controversy of it is exactly how and
why and when.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, still very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a paper in Scientific American,
December 2012, by actually a colleague of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine at Cornell, Chuck Green, goes through
his take on all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually predicts deeper
differences in the tips in the jet stream
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern so that actually if you have a
cold front, it could more freezes in
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida, despite a warmer world,
because of the Arctic melting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And slower moving jet streams,
which means every heat wave or any cold
[SPEAKER_02]: wave that we might get lasts longer
because it's slower moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other climate scientists that
say, no, that's not how the jet streams
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to change in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say something about direct
carbon dioxide effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of interesting to think
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably all know that plants take up
carbon dioxide for photosynthesis to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce sugars to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CO2 is, you know, there's a so-called
CO2 fertilization effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, if you grow plants,
most plants under optimum conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: no heat stress, no climate change,
no insect pests or anything, they'll get a
[SPEAKER_02]: slight to a moderate to even a high boost
in growth for at least a period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: just due to the higher carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget climate change, even if there is no
climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an interesting study done at Duke
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is looking down at a loblolly pine
forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are huge, tall risers of PVC
pipe, as tall as the trees that are
[SPEAKER_02]: perforated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of these rings is at some
different CO2 levels by spewing in CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite an amazing, big science project,
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea was to see how does the CO2 going
to affect the tree growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did spur the tree growth for a
period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it sort of slowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That impact slowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, some of the biggest news out
of this was that in the understory in the
[SPEAKER_02]: high CO2 rings, the poison ivy grew like
gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much so that it really disturbed in a
pretty major way their plans for the
[SPEAKER_02]: study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this actually has now been documented
that basically a lot of our most
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive, fast-growing, viney weeds
benefit the most from high CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different plant species respond very
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while many plant species can get a
little boost, some will get more than
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out our most aggressive invasive
weeds are the big winners in this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, my colleague, Lou Ziska at the USDA
lab has done some work on use of
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicides to control weeds in high CO2
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's just a picture illustration of
one of his experiments looking at CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: levels predicted for near mid to late
century.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Canadian thistle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these were infected with plenty of
Canadian thistle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on this side, sprayed the recommended
rate of glyphosate, Roundup, very common
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, on both sides, sprayed the
recommended rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got very little control on the
high CO2 side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to go to like two to three times
the rate to get the same control,
[SPEAKER_02]: which leads us to a concern of how will
farmers and some gardeners be adapting to
[SPEAKER_02]: this, spraying more herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there can be, we can't
really tie the hands of farmers as they
[SPEAKER_02]: adapt, but we have to be prepared for some
of these kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, all of this, that kind of ends my
climate change stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go now more into impacts and
what we can do in the garden to adapt and
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, little question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you, the details are very
uncertain, but I think we can say with a
[SPEAKER_02]: high degree of certainty that the kind of
climate change we're going and will be
[SPEAKER_02]: undergoing this century is going to really
change the very fabric of the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: landscapes we see out there in various
ways over the next several decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this could have
implications for so-called ecosystem
[SPEAKER_02]: services, everything from by ecosystem
service, I mean, bringing in tourism
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars, for example, the maple beach
birch trees are going to be less suitable
[SPEAKER_02]: for our climate in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show a graphic on that in a moment,
but also water quality, habitat for birds,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, could be disrupted as different
species come and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some, it's not that there's not going
to be any vegetation out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some of the existing species will have
to go and others will be coming in to take
[SPEAKER_02]: their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is showing a study done basically on
modeling how the climate's changing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Northeast and tree specialists knowing how
to model where trees grow, looking at what
[SPEAKER_02]: that might mean for the trees,
major tree species mixes in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_02]: based pretty much on the climate envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this doesn't mean this is really
exactly how the tree species will,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's going to replace who, because it
depends on whether the seed for the
[SPEAKER_02]: replacement trees gets up here and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the current situation,
you see a lot of gold color.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's maple beach birch that basically
says New York is mostly kind of very
[SPEAKER_02]: suitable for maple beach birch in West L
.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a lot of those here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little green here, you see that spruce
fir trees in the Adirondacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some of that in the Catskills too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is looking at the scenario for
the lower emissions and kind of the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: case scenario, how that might change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see even in the kind of best
case scenario, we lose the spruce fir from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Adirondacks, basically from New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, I can't really say they're going
to disappear, but the climate will no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer be suitable for spruce fir.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of them will be hanging on,
they'll be less healthy over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and gradually they will be diminishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gray that's replacing some of this,
this is the higher emissions, basically
[SPEAKER_02]: even lose a lot of our maple beach birch,
is oak hickory pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are oak really going to come up here
and replace the maple beach birch?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's anybody's guess if the seeds
can disperse that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we've got another problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you the deer are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what tree seedlings do deer prefer
most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tree species that's likely to
replace the maples is going to get eaten
[SPEAKER_02]: up by the deer, so that's really not
likely to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to give you one example of how
complicated it is to predict the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we can really say is our natural
landscapes are going to be disassembling
[SPEAKER_02]: and reassembling in new ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can be very pessimistic about this
and get all down in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you might just say, well, nature is
going to be changing and some things might
[SPEAKER_02]: be good, some not so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But natural resource managers,
I'm working with the Nature Conservancy
[SPEAKER_02]: right now on a climate change adaptation
plan for New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't really manage these days for
keeping the exact same species there
[SPEAKER_02]: forever, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to be a little flexible
and actually maybe even facilitate some
[SPEAKER_02]: other species to come in that have the
same function as a species that's no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer suitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really makes it very complicated for
natural resource managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, in the garden, there's this
same sort of thing going on, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the different garden plants you might
prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will be able to adapt to
climate change and some will have to
[SPEAKER_02]: gradually be different species you might
be growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to spend time on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That report I mentioned goes into a lot of
details about what trees are likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit, gain suitable habitat,
which are likely to lose habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of information out there
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, to kind of set the stage for
what I want to talk about as I begin
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapping this up towards the adaptation
piece is that for the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're luckier than some parts of the world
where it's already as hot as you'd ever
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, a warmer growing season and longer
growing season has some potential silver
[SPEAKER_02]: lining.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there could be exploring new species
and new varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, gardeners can really be sort of
at the forefront of exploring some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder for a farmer to do a lot of
experimenting because it's very expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: and involves their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so there's some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some of our favorites we might
have to eventually give up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are going to have certainly
weeds, diseases, and insects like we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't seen before in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think of what it's like south of
here and what gardeners there have to
[SPEAKER_02]: face, that's the kind of thing we'll be
facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have more summer heat
stress than we've seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not as bad as some other places,
but worse than it has been here before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the water management problem
of both some flooding events and also more
[SPEAKER_02]: dry parts of the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing that we can't adapt to as long
as we don't go onto that drastic path.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something to be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an interesting example,
I think, just showing the case for
[SPEAKER_02]: European wine grapes, which are so
important to our Finger Lakes area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just showing you how that affects just
within a single species, Vitis bunifera,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the varieties respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our current New York growing
season in terms of its average
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see this is why we do good
Rieslings in this area and Chardonnays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're right in that zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what our climate's projected to
be by 2050.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really on the fringe of being
able to do good Chardonnays.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we can do those Merlots and
Cabernet Sauvignon that the Napa Valley
[SPEAKER_02]: can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Napa Valley today is right about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Napa Valley's looking at is just
the next 30 years is going off the deep
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the Napa Valley, it's kind of
bad news for the wine grape industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Opportunities for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is kind of illustrative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even for us, by the end of the century,
we really get awfully hot, even for some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the grape varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the world we live in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warmer winters, there's lots of potential
pests that we don't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the winter, they get killed
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes the fleas on our dogs and
garden pests and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just examples of a few that are
all showing up more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a flea beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It carries a big corn disease called
Stuart's Wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a vector for that disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to marginally overwinter here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it overwinters very often,
a particular ear, corn earworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudzu, some of you from the south may be
aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another one like Poison Ivy Gains
from the high CO2, as well as the warming
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, has historically kept Kudzu
south of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's showing up more north.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some modeling work we did of the
Kudzu habitable range changing with time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go from current day or short term to
end of century.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business as usual, kind of higher emission
scenario, worst case scenario,
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dark orange is basically the Kudzu
habitable range coming to get us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is showing Hemlock woolly adelgid,
a big little tiny aphid-like insect that
[SPEAKER_02]: is moving northward with climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being very destructive to Hemlock stands
in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So adapting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, plant selection,
diversifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what a lot of farmers are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a time in the garden
already to start thinking about mixing it
[SPEAKER_02]: up maybe a little bit more to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be something of interest you'd
like to try that requires a slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer temperature, might do better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to hedge your bets just to make
sure you get what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't really know what the
climate's gonna throw at us, the weather's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna throw at us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So experimenting is definitely something
to be doing in terms of plant selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly we can think about earlier
planting dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: More vigilant weed and pest monitoring and
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things with water management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides the idea of irrigation or drainage
or moving your garden to a place that's
[SPEAKER_02]: better drained or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just building healthier soils with more
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives better water holding capacity
to buffer you from drought and better
[SPEAKER_02]: drainage to buffer you from flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So doing that sort of thing that many of
you are probably already doing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: More reason for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then frost and freeze protection for
those perennial plants in those years
[SPEAKER_02]: where we have jeopardy due to a very
uneven winter and early spring
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And commercial growers are doing a lot
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the landscape, this is how we do a lot
of our landscape planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compacting the heck out of soil to lay
cement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the kind of thing,
if we're having more frequent rainfall,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of urban areas are looking at this
as an issue because it creates more
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nina Bassick at Cornell has worked with
this stuff called structural soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is basically a mixture of rocks and
soil that allows you to compact soils for
[SPEAKER_02]: asphalt and cement laying in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But avoid compacting it so much that
plants can't grow underneath that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that you can't have good
drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one way people are beginning to
adapt to climate change at the landscape
[SPEAKER_02]: planning level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, porous asphalt is another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting into kind of the real not so much
coping with the inevitable climate change,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what I've been kind of talking
about so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we deal with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more like being part of the
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so certainly plants take up carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of trees that have a lot
of carbon in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of trees in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of million tons of carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those trees, that carbon, if they all
were chopped down and destroyed,
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposed, or burned, all that carbon
would go back into the atmosphere as CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trees are a big storage pool of carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly keeping the trees we have,
it's an added incentive to keep those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also this idea of planting a
tree, sucking up that CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, plants do take up the carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they do lose some carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as much as they take up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually store more than they give
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bad news is, for the average of
us, it would probably take 20 trees to
[SPEAKER_02]: take up as much CO2 as you emit in a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have to plant 20 trees every year
to keep up with your CO2 emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mayors like to say, we're going to do a
tree planting, and we're going to solve
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do the math, and what it would
take in New York, New York City to solve
[SPEAKER_02]: it with trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to be too facetious,
because actually it's this piece that's
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has a big cooling effect,
plus the shade of trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, people who've done the
number crunching, when you add that in,
[SPEAKER_02]: trees have a pretty substantial benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cooling effect of trees can out,
in terms of urban areas and reducing the
[SPEAKER_02]: use of air conditioners, is where the big
climate change mitigation piece comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trees, I don't want to take away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they do take up some carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they play some benefit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not going to solve the
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that many people are really aware of
how big a problem relevant to climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change that nitrogen fertilizer is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when nitrogen fertilizer,
first of all, if you buy synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen fertilizers, it takes four to six
tons of carbon, or typically emitted into
[SPEAKER_02]: the atmosphere, per ton of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manufactured.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, if you go to the
garden, and you go to the gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: center, and you buy a bag of urea,
you just, you know, up your carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: All nitrogen fertilizers, even if you're
using manures or compost, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in them, as it decomposes and
becomes available for plant roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a sort of a something you can't
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbial activity involved in the
nitrogen cycle releases a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: this gas called nitrous oxide,
which is a third very important greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, on a molecule per molecule basis,
300 times more potent than CO2 in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: its warming potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do the pie chart on,
for example, US agricultural contributions
[SPEAKER_02]: to climate change and global warming,
it's not the CO2 from driving tractors or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the nitrous oxide emissions from
fertilizer that's over the largest
[SPEAKER_02]: fraction of the pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything you can do to be more
efficient and conservative about nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: use is probably the biggest thing,
one of the biggest things you can do in
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are over three million acres of lawn
in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those get a lot of nitrogen
fertilizer, unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of the issue is, you know,
trying to have, you want your lawn to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the first to green up in the spring
instead of letting the soils warm up,
[SPEAKER_02]: let the microbes go to work, that release
some nitrogen naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early applications of nitrogen
fertilizer are, you know, something to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of think about holding back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mature lawns really don't require much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some guidelines, and Frank
Rossier, Cornell 2, has developed some
[SPEAKER_02]: detailed guidelines on how you can be more
efficient in terms of nitrogen management
[SPEAKER_02]: on lawns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using legumes, you know, these are plants
that actually capture nitrogen from the
[SPEAKER_02]: air and then make it available to the soil
and subsequent plants in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So farmers are looking at this instead of
synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm mixing those up in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to show this slide like when I go
to policy briefings in D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: and see how long it takes the audience to
see what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know what you see there,
but I see, you know, nitrogen carbonate
[SPEAKER_02]: energy that's going to waste if we don't
recycle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly, you know, using these kind
of organic sources of nitrogen is a big,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're avoiding that carbon
footprint of buying synthetic nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing is, you know, out in the
garden, every time you're out there
[SPEAKER_02]: tilling the soil, just like we tell
farmers out there with their big tillage
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, plowing and mixing it up,
do ask yourself, why am I doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure you have a good reason for
doing it, because what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: really pumping oxygen into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is speeds up the
microbial breakdown of organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where does that carbon go?
[SPEAKER_02]: But up into the atmosphere as CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're decreasing, you know,
the stability of the organic matter that
[SPEAKER_02]: you already have in your soil and you're
losing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times it starts particularly in
agricultural situations with compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's this need where we need
to till the soil to avoid the compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, as I say, that over aerates the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You burn off that organic matter and then
you have a soil that's less healthy for
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbes are very important in
creating a soil that's well aggregated and
[SPEAKER_02]: has good drainage and you end up with kind
of a vicious circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're out there in the garden
tilling, for example, you can till just
[SPEAKER_02]: where you have to plant the seeds and not
the whole garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really reducing tillage, you've
probably heard about a lot of farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: going to no till or reduced till.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it is to build organic matter
in their soils, but also it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, reducing the CO2 emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So building soil organic matter,
reducing tillage, using cover crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: manures and compost, all of that stores
carbon in the soil that otherwise would be
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the air as CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done your good deed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also increases resilience, as we said
before, to drought and flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of adaptation and mitigation
combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, while I'm sure many of you grow
some of your own food, you also are at
[SPEAKER_02]: Wegmans or Farmers Market or whatever
buying food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, think about, you know,
your choices and how they affect what
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been, there's a big,
you know, major movement happening now
[SPEAKER_02]: around the country and around much of the
developed world for sure of consumers and
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurateurs, chefs wanting to know where
their food's coming from, wanting to know
[SPEAKER_02]: how the farmers are farming and creating a
whole back demand for farmers to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing the right thing in terms of
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, this is my last slide,
I think, just kind of summarizing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: planting trees and other perennials in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that does help to cool the
environment, reducing human energies and
[SPEAKER_02]: also sequesters carbon, you know,
in that woody biomass and that perennial
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass and the roots of those perennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a very good thing to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to say to gardeners,
you know, you can do less in the garden
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're doing your part, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be out there tilling the soil as
much as you used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fertilize your nitrogen,
your lawn as much as you used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mow the lawn as often as you used
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use less fossil fuels, replace it with
renewables, reduce use of disposable
[SPEAKER_02]: plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things are really a big part
of the mitigation things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, thinking about buying
local, growing some of your own,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll stop at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so every year I kind of get asked,
you know, by the news media about what's
[SPEAKER_02]: the weather this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the fall color going to be and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are certain conditions that are
supposed to be, you know, characteristic
[SPEAKER_02]: of good fall color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing is we had, the only answer I
have is that this fall was truly delayed,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is something we see more early-ness
in the spring than we see delay in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more dramatic on the spring side
normally, because we have much warmer
[SPEAKER_02]: winters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year we saw a significant delay
in the fall and a very long, warm fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens as temperatures cool in
the fall is the green color, the
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll in the leaves, begins to
degrade, just breaks down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what actually that does is there's
actually some of those bright colors that
[SPEAKER_02]: we see beneath, like the yellows and the
golds and reds, are actually there much of
[SPEAKER_02]: the time, but they don't really show
themselves because they're so masked by
[SPEAKER_02]: the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened with the warm fall like
we had, the green color was not degrading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as it did degrade, it didn't
allow it didn't degrade as fast and as
[SPEAKER_02]: thoroughly to, you know, allow that good
full color.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had some other conditions that were
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good wet early part of the year,
so that's part of a good fall color.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it was just too long and warm
of a fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't allow that chlorophyll
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: For years we've been, actually before
there was even an issue of climate change,
[SPEAKER_02]: those who monitor pests had developed a
simple winter model that predicted how bad
[SPEAKER_02]: the flea beetles would be, basically based
on how cold they got.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, you know, the models all
show basically most winters now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We show more populations than we used to
have.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the allergen, so Lou Ziska has done
the work on this and published this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the allergenic part is really hard to
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly the, like I said, the weed
growth itself is stimulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that if we were to
generalize plant, what happens is plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: so they're exposed to more CO2,
so they photosynthesize more, they get
[SPEAKER_02]: more sugars in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some plants can't find places to put
that sugar fast enough to keep up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those plants that are really viney and
fast growing, they find, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they keep spreading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing like with an indeterminate
tomato versus a determinant tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeterminate would benefit more from CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these weeds benefit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea of the allergenic thing is
still poorly understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's actually, it's not just that
there's more plant there with more
[SPEAKER_02]: allergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, you know, per unit leaf area,
it's more potent and it's not well
[SPEAKER_00]: understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's harder to predict what's
going to happen this winter than it is
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to happen in the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like, you know, trying to,
like looking, spending one day in the
[SPEAKER_02]: stock market and looking at the ups and
downs all day and trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: what's that going to do to the economy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the economy going to like 10 years
from now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually easier to predict that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stock market would probably be up 10
years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to try to figure out what's going to
be an hour from now is hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this winter, you know, I think I really
don't know the answer because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really study that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like a weather issue and a
meteorology issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Art DeGatano at Cornell is someone who
really tracks it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a way of getting a handle,
at least a rough handle on just what it
[SPEAKER_02]: might be based on what's happening in
other parts of the globe with the jet
[SPEAKER_02]: stream patterns and what's happening with
ocean temperatures that affect when,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, we get these Arctic blasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they can look at something now in
terms of things that might be happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: the North Atlantic or whatever and get
some idea of what kind of winter we're
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have heard the same thing that
we're, you know, we could have a colder
[SPEAKER_02]: winter this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assume it goes back to some of the
meteorologists who've been looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: those trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually are because I think it's
becoming just more variable though and
[SPEAKER_02]: harder for everybody to predict.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's more work going on in the
area of meteorology to try to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: better forecasting systems because every,
it's not so much that we're just seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that basically we're seeing,
you know, climate weirding is what some
[SPEAKER_02]: people say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean just, you know, it's just getting
harder and harder to predict.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of farmers say it's just that one
in 10 years we used to have something we
[SPEAKER_02]: had never seen on the farm before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's one in three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not always that it's hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that it's the coldest winter and now
it's the wettest summer and now it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: driest summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and that's I think partly because
it's not as simple as we once thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there's things like these jet
stream patterns being affected and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think, you know,
it's hard to attribute, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: single weather events and stuff to climate
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, for example, that,
you know, more, you know, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is this real, something we can't
attribute to climate change is more heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: rains that can cause some short-term
flooding, which could be enough to do some
[SPEAKER_02]: root damage, which could slow down plants,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there could have been something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is what happened with kind
of like stunted growth as we, after the
[SPEAKER_02]: rains in late summer and then we saw this
long kind of a fall that was pretty warm
[SPEAKER_02]: and things weren't growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.

Thank you.
