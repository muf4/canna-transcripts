[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I'm talking to audiences
of artists, which is one kind of talk and
[SPEAKER_00]: one kind of audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of what I do is really meant to
be bridging and translating vocabularies
[SPEAKER_00]: between different disciplines and
addressing over-specialization when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have complex problems to address and
complex systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Johannes mentioned, I was a faculty
member for about 15 years at a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different art schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my work as an artist kept moving me
closer and closer to what I could only
[SPEAKER_00]: understand as research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no vocabulary in the art
world for conducting research by making
[SPEAKER_00]: artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I left and became what I've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told as now an independent
scholar, which meant I needed an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization to back me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I invented one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I do is I work with artists to
recognize that their process of making art
[SPEAKER_00]: is a form of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that research that scientists or other
artists or other disciplines may do is
[SPEAKER_00]: also producing art, that they are related
to each other in a really important way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna fly through a bunch of
material as quickly as I can so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a conversation about it,
because I'm particularly interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of questions you may have and
how you may see your own relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: the kinds of learning and the ways of
knowing that artists use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question may be, you're all
asking and I'm often asked, is what is it
[SPEAKER_00]: that artists actually do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone have a quick picture of the
answer about what artists do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is, but that's a
good answer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Observe the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: create an interpretation of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're a step ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already recognizing that the
observation, that's the big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, well, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You make artists make art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they look at the interpretation,
they look at the object that artists are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing as the result of being an
artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be easier to comprehend if I
ask you, what do scientists do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would anyone in this room say,
oh, we make science?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a much better vocabulary,
I think at least, in the sciences for what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that scientists do, because there
are systems, there are methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's basically, science is understood as
a means of learning about the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are structures through which you
stage your learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact is that art actually is the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even scientists also use the similar
vocabulary to artists, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if what you've done is
useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: In science, the thing works.
[SPEAKER_00]: In art, we talk about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artwork works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't necessarily describe why,
because we haven't built up that
[SPEAKER_00]: vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a part of the problem that I'm
trying to address among artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we recognize that something works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see artists and scientists as
essentially cousins, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're related to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're related around this idea that
what we do is we learn about the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce knowledge about the world
around and within us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a super loaded slide with tons
and tons of historical implications that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take a snapshot of and email me
about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of a rough map I drew of
the creation of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, particularly in the West,
where once scientists and artists were the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were natural philosophers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We observed the world around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Enlightenment came.
[SPEAKER_00]: The empirical method came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And scientists became scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no offense, but at the time,
the science wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method was good, but it was still very
crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result of that was that artists became
romantics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at what scientists were doing,
trying to break the world apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand its constituent pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And artists said, what about the
ineffable?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about spirit?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about soul?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about faith, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so art and religion became bound
together in this idea of romance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was romanticism, what I've called
art religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with modernism, art and religion
had its own schism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we see a kind of disciplinary
or sort of knowledge production
[SPEAKER_00]: categorization, specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing is that scientists collect
data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the empirical method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You observe, you experiment, and you
gather data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you synthesize that data and make
sense of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So artists do the same thing, but we don't
have a vocabulary for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in art school, we don't recognize what
kind of knowledge we're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just create the objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what artists produce, this is what
artists are taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are taught to make art.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring it into class, and we critique
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do with the Artists Literacies
Institute is I bring together artists at
[SPEAKER_00]: all stages of their career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do these interdisciplinary workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with artists one on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep asking the same question over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you know it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I ask an artist that, that can be
very challenging for a lot of artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a hunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can sense it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use my intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call these things artists'
literacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll point that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it is a literacy in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an artist's literacy, they are our
senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are our sensitivities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are our ways of knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every artist, I believe, may have
different ways of knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect that our artistic
disciplines, our media, are different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: of learning that we've selected and
reflect the possession of unique
[SPEAKER_00]: literacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unique ways of knowing about the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason it's a literacy is because a
literacy has to go in two directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just read, but you can't write,
you aren't fully literate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can write, but you can't read,
you aren't fully literate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a literacy doesn't necessarily have to
deal with only words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of everyone in the room is almost
an environmental scientist, a scientist of
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know anything about
environmental science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like I come in just not knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how you know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could come to school here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a filmmaker, if I spent a few weeks
here among you with a camera and spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and observed you and talked with
you and watched, I would start to learn a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about environmental science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would learn it the way that I learn,
which is I tell stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make narrative and causative connections
between things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that might surprise you is
that in practice, in doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may actually learn things about
environmental science and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists that you yourselves don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that observer present can be a
really very powerful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new things that we can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because I have what I call a
literacy in narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narrative itself I would define as
perceived causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go and watch a movie,
these different clips of footage are stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: together and they make sense to you
because you perceive causation between
[SPEAKER_00]: those clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mental and cognitive process
that we sit in an editing room and spend
[SPEAKER_00]: months poring over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does cut A make sense with cut B?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think that an audience would
recognize causation between A and B,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's a narrative connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing happens if I'm just sitting
here with a camera and I'm looking around
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making kind of very quick,
rapid, I'm reading, using my literacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading, I'm saying something,
people are responding in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking around and I'm making
narrative connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way of knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't teach that in film school
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perceived causation, and this is a
model project where I was testing this in
[SPEAKER_00]: Uganda, actually trying to understand why
elephant and ivory-bearing animal
[SPEAKER_00]: populations were declining in some places
and rising in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in looking through the lens of
perceived causation, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can tell a story about why certain
systems are working better than other
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, maybe we can understand something
causative about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a real puzzle because across
Africa, certain parts of East Africa were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing elephant populations rise and
certain parts were seeing them fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the same interventions were being
applied in both of those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was something different in one
context as opposed to another one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, maybe if we told a story about
it, we might be able to see something we
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a kind of visualization of what
that cognitive process to a filmmaker
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at a film frame, I don't
actually see these squares, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: squares represent a way of looking for a
filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, within a single image,
there is a ton of material, a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: visual information that I'm able to read,
and I also know that my audience is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my audience, again, sad to say,
is probably mostly illiterate,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly visually illiterate, because we
don't teach visual literacy the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: teach verbal and textual literacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will look at an image and you will
start to make very quick evaluations about
[SPEAKER_00]: people, context, tone, mood, emotion,
because you're human beings, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: see that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can perceive these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the difference between being able
to watch a film and being able to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone in the room can watch a film.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a lot of work and training to
be able to make a film.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is within one film frame,
and there are three categories of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge in that film frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next film, then the next cut
comes along.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three more categories of
knowledge, and they speak to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not only intramural or
intra-frame information, but there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: intra-frame information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it very quickly multiplies,
and a film becomes a really complex site
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowing, cognitive and subconscious
knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, you get to see that
knowledge in the form of a continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: stream of scenes, a film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to wonder what it would look
like if it wasn't all in a line,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we were able to hop around the
media based on things like decisions that
[SPEAKER_00]: got made, behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a map of narrative linkages
between different scenes in a film that
[SPEAKER_00]: conceivably we could follow and learn
different things about the characters in
[SPEAKER_00]: the film, the people who are living these
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is a kind of what we call
coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it in an editing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most filmmakers are not doing it
consciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of just dialogue and discourse
in the editing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You iterate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try it again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show people rough cuts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very, again, kind of scientific
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, yeah, it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't quite work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we only get known for our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it works for a filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started to wonder, well,
what about other forms of art making?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about other creative practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides narrative, what are these other
kinds of literacies that might be out
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually just the other day
actually at this Hans Haak show at the New
[SPEAKER_00]: Museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really interesting artist in
the sense that he's been doing these kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of investigations in things like these
natural phenomena for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mound of dirt in early earthwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if I put a pile of dirt and a
bunch of grass seed in an art gallery?
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also a detective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 1960s, he uncovered an enormous
real estate scheme in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Guggenheim wouldn't exhibit
it because he said, this isn't art,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is police work, real estate work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Hans Haak is being displayed in the
New Museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the outcomes of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's being consumed as entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, because of the
structures of the art world.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can only recognize the finished
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is that Hans Haak learned things
nobody else knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no mechanism for him as an
artist to bring that learning to the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could bring it to a journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could bring it to scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those connections didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine you might look at something like
grass grows, and all kinds of ideas come
[SPEAKER_00]: to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the content of the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of grass is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have literacies that Hans Haak didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is just trying something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's this investigator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, what are the kinds of
data that are being crunched when an
[SPEAKER_00]: artist is producing their work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of what we make as just art,
there's also something important,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our process.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get to that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm calling these primary text and
producer texts because if I call them
[SPEAKER_00]: texts, texts can be coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texts can be analyzed and interpreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So artists produce art.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a much bigger way, we spend most of
our time in our process, sketching,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, making memos, making notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we end up with lots and lots of texts
that tend to go unanalyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artists are taught to hide that stuff
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put that in the gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something else that art produces,
of course, is its effect on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a much bigger way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people will watch a film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are happening in the
sensibilities and in the hearts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who experience that film.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Johannes mentioned, I also work as an
impact producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a made up job that people
invented about 10 years ago, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: around social issue documentaries,
which is how do you make a film and then
[SPEAKER_00]: contextualize it so that it can create
social change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the framework of impact
partly because it's a little colonial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that I'm a fast moving object and
I can impact another community or society
[SPEAKER_00]: with my artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But impact producer is the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are companies that do this for
films.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take your film.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contextualize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They survey their audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do social science around how people
perceive the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they try and build agendas and
engagement campaigns, sometimes to create
[SPEAKER_00]: policy change and address legislators,
sometimes to create community change or
[SPEAKER_00]: educational programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that the film is no
longer the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact now is the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make an artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an effect on audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether we like it to or not,
those audiences then have an effect on our
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to listen to people at my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to listen to people who have
talked about my previous work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to inform the process and
create this cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: My previous art is also going to inform my
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: My process is also going to then touch on
the audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the churn of the artistic
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The art itself is a very small part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm interested in is what kind of
data exists in these effect bubbles in
[SPEAKER_00]: this process bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we code that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we see the knowledge that's
being produced there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all kinds of artists, there are
these kinds of texts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I call a knowledge engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: An artist is basically a driver of a
knowledge engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the artists can't all by themselves
capture all that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's much too much in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who have recognized that their literacy in
being able to embody and verbatim perform
[SPEAKER_00]: real living people are a knowledge engine
for audiences to identify implicit biases
[SPEAKER_00]: in how their political preferences are
actually shaped in a spectacle
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lindsey Graham, when embodied by a
female actor, people perceive this person
[SPEAKER_00]: very differently and recognize that their
political preferences are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: all their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have deep, structural implicit biases
that are affecting those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsey Graham gets away with things that
this actor cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Audiences respond very different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the same group of actors,
we're now doing this for the democratic
[SPEAKER_00]: primaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: By body, gender, and race swapping all the
democratic candidates, we're testing
[SPEAKER_00]: people and their own perceptions of their
political preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are really, really surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is, as I said, we go in not
knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we aren't there to tell people who to
vote for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do find out is that people
don't actually know why they prefer the
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their preferences are being shaped by a
lot of factors that they're not conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this does is it allows us to
get them to see and think more critically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is really important in
terms of resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a democracy that is driven by
spectacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, our choices are not really
our own if we are not critical and
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious of the spectacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with a sculptor who is
interested in studying social dynamics as
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a choreographer looking for
methods and the qualitative data in what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call applied choreography.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does her familiarity with body,
kinetics, and the movement of an organism
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do with?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's both a choreographer and a
demographer for the city of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she also studies the movement of
populations, the changes of community,
[SPEAKER_00]: changes of neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is build a
bridge between those two ways of knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these experiences,
performances, choreography,
[SPEAKER_00]: choreographies, sculptures, any artwork,
any photograph, any film can be coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can code those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can code all of the producer texts
that are made in the meantime as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, there's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they might be data types that we don't
recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, data is not knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not enough just to gather the
data, but we also have to synthesize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowledge exists only within a
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data can exist outside of the world all on
its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a conscience or consciousness to
recognize knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was wondering, do artists just go
out and gather information without
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing that it's information,
and then skip ahead to synthesizing into
[SPEAKER_00]: artworks?
[SPEAKER_00]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know to what extent is
synthesis within science not acknowledging
[SPEAKER_00]: certain kinds of data types, not
acknowledging or recognizing even the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of kinds of knowing, either
within the scientists themselves or within
[SPEAKER_00]: the systems that they're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like we need each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So artists, when they get around
scientists, get really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recognize all these opportunities for
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh my god, I could make something
out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could make a project out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you guys are doing is really
interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand it, but I want to
synthesize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the artistic drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas think about Hans Hock or any of
these other projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You as scientists might look at it and be
like, oh my god, there's so much data in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should draw some of that data out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should draw some of that information
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there is a symbiosis there
that we are kind of lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a prominent and really pertinent
example of this right now in addressing
[SPEAKER_00]: the most pressing issue of our time,
how can research and intervention through
[SPEAKER_00]: artist's literacies be a meaningful
component of our response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists have presented all the evidence
necessary to demonstrate that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, there's no movement or very
little movement, or it's just painfully,
[SPEAKER_00]: painfully slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't necessarily a question of
resources, of where the carbon is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of what the temperature is, but it's a
question of relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is our relationship to the earth,
to the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are human beings' relationships to
one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get rid of us if it needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have to do is we have to recognize
our relationship to the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that can really
empower us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really empower artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of artists that I talk to around
this issue feel disempowered because they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like it's a scientific issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists I talk to feel disempowered
because they're like, look, we put the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow, our relationship to the
information, to the knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: just doesn't seem to actually create any
traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I feel like this is where this
is not one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to supplement and complement one
another's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the talk where
artists, audiences of artists,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather, start to ask me about
instrumentalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artists don't want to be instrumentalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's OK to be instrumentalized
because we can be tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, artists have this sense left
over from that previous map of our
[SPEAKER_00]: romantic past that we're a little bit
outside of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we're a little bit like,
maybe we're special.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's ineffable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that we do can't be touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they're innately human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are important ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everything that we do,
I don't think can be quantified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we instrumentalizing or are we
identifying new value in the poetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ineffable, in the effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an important thing to
maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinds of instrumentalization that you may
see in art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are not necessarily
negative things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these do compartmentalize art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem to steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how familiar you are with the
stem to steam movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's looking at the stem emphasis in
especially American high schools and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, well, you're leaving out something
really important there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crisis, I would say, in stem to steam
is that nobody actually knows what the A
[SPEAKER_00]: for art is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is actually supposed to be doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's science, technology, engineering,
and math with A jammed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often what artists get pigeonholed
into doing is this third thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: data visualization and communications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys gather the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, can you make us a nice
chart or design our website for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only economic value artists
feel like they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the product of our process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activism is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a compartmentalization of what
artists are actually capable of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason artists have gotten to the
point of activism is because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we come to learn those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Human-centered design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the contemporary art
market, which is maybe not fully familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but a super insidious problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the wealth farm for the world's
richest people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only two things that actually
generate wealth, generate money from
[SPEAKER_00]: nothingness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is contemporary art and real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contemporary art is just money from thin
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it drives economies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And artists are caught in this trap of
making work, striving to get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: gallery, striving to gain a reputation,
striving to become a brand, striving to be
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're being collected by,
frankly, the people who are creating some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most significant problems in the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expanding on these instrumentalizations
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these has to be pushed beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's done by coming back and
recognizing that the value that artists
[SPEAKER_00]: bring is not necessarily in the artwork,
but it is in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in our way of learning, in our way
of knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to figure out how we can value
the process of art making the same way we
[SPEAKER_00]: value the process of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: As scientists, if you just tell me that
you're going to spend the next three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, five, or 10 years conducting
research, nobody has a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do that as an artist, well,
that's not economically sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know what research looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as artists, we have work to do to
educate ourselves about what art is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What art-based research looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we integrate it with other
forms of research so that other
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers can recognize what we do and
see the value in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I want to hear from you,
take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can skip back to any slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, let me have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that some scientists don't
understand the ways of understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you give us some examples of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about artists versus
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my understanding of art is that it
is leaping ahead to synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have a lot of vocabulary
for data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of vocabulary for
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, I did a lot of work with USAID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done a lot of work with
organizations that rely on scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: data, but haven't synthesized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what this means.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's particularly a big data
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a trend away from that,
which I'm hopeful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sense of, is it enough to just
show us a map or a giant set of data
[SPEAKER_00]: points without synthesizing, well,
what is the meaning of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that often is when scientists and art
do come back to artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me synthesize this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me visualize it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me understand it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that we can
definitely do and then complement each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about how one of your
works had to do with finding a narrative
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's happening with elephant
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you come to any sort of conclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we actually only, we did about a
three-day survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super quick because I was sent
there for, and this is how artists often
[SPEAKER_00]: get a wedge in, a foothold in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sent there to make a film for USAID
about something else in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, can I have three extra days
and model this mode of research for a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that you guys don't have a
solution for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they connected me to the African
Wildlife Foundation and said, sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can figure out why Uganda is seeing
rising elephant populations, the elephant
[SPEAKER_00]: population in Uganda has skyrocketed since
the Civil War there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, in Tanzania, it is continuing
to plummet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still poaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, the interventions, like the
government interventions and the community
[SPEAKER_00]: interventions, are kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's happening in Uganda that's
not happening in Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't get to do a comparative study
in Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a kind of preliminary study on a
few days of just talking with rangers,
[SPEAKER_00]: observing them, following them through
their work processes, and then coding the
[SPEAKER_00]: footage, evaluating the footage on a
narrative lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I didn't know what they didn't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just gave them a report back and
said, the things that's amazing about
[SPEAKER_00]: these rangers is that they're really
patriotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from all over Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they join the, the Uganda
Wildlife Authority, that's like joining
[SPEAKER_00]: the military in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they describe their patriotism,
defending their natural resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting their country's identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of like, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the UWA and the AWF, no, not AWF,
based in the US, not the Wildlife
[SPEAKER_00]: Patriotic Society, but the other
organization that we were working for,
[SPEAKER_00]: had never heard of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know, they didn't realize
patriotism was important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Uganda, right, I mean, people are
coming from their villages and from their
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, and there is, you know,
there's a lot of this kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fractured national identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were uniting around Uganda's
natural resources, its wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly they realized, oh,
this is a way we can recruit rangers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the biggest things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need more rangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need more people who are out
there protecting the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recruitment is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, we should recruit on
patriotism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do it for Uganda, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we recruit soldiers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you see it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's so much kind of
militarism in America and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: patriotism that unites us as a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uganda has found that they can unite
themselves as a country around defending
[SPEAKER_00]: their wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work actually for the Elephantism
Project at the Labrador.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I do is I make
videos of the week to, like, increase
[SPEAKER_01]: public outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there some tips or anything that you
could, like, give to those who want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, increase their visual literacy?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the terms of me, it's not necessarily
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, like, when we have videos of
elephants, we're like, oh, these match.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is the same behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like, which is a little easier when
you understand those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like, for people, I know that you
said, like, there's differences unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing it is the best way to do it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it is the best way to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You develop literacy by trying to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you develop visual literacy by trying
to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that key question I would keep coming
back to is what do you know and how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at an image, when you
look at a moving image, ask yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what do I know about this image?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where did that knowledge come
from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I, you know, just skip quickly
to a slide like this, right, you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a slide like that and be like,
all right, it's three people sitting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row, but what do I know about it,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's an authority figure,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recognize age difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recognize some sort of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an institutional context.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell that by the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at people's facial expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, here's how I know what's happening
in this scene, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the story that's unfolding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you basically split this up
into categories of knowledge, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I know how to make an image that
can tell the story I want to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the biggest kind of failure in
visual literacy that you would see when
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a film is like, well, that didn't
make any sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the audience interpreted it one
way and the filmmakers intended it
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just a background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, using the wrong image,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the wrong shot, using the wrong
angle, and recognizing, as you would,
[SPEAKER_00]: that every single detail matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the camera angle?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: How clear is the sound?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are components in our
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal relationship between artists and
scientists is what we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adjacency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just there's a school of
science and there's a school of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often do you see each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you just sit next to each
other and just kind of cross-pollinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly, those artists and those scientists
have to be armed with an openness when you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at an artwork to say, hey,
this is full of data, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an artist would be like, there is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the adjacency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should be artist studios right
there, and they should be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a playground in a sandbox of
where artist studios are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just play and test and experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can walk in and be like,
hey, what are you up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we don't need to
instrumentalize artists and have them
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded as residents and do science.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're not going to be good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could just be there, and you can
see in our work what you see, and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see in your work what we see, and we can
work together going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every studio is renaming itself a lab now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because exactly for this reason,
I think, a lab has a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a technological overtone
to a lab that isn't in a studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as artists start to adopt
technologies, their studios become labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of places for experimentation,
play, testing, and observation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need a science test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it exist, and what would it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know, and how do you know it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that science, I'm going to
totally put my foot in my mouth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding of science is that it's a
much more structured way of learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are steps in the process,
and there is peer review, and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual recognition of what's good science
and what's bad science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always work, and I think
sometimes it comes down to the tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it comes down to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that where science literacy
would be valuable, is understanding also
[SPEAKER_00]: the human presence in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, everyone in this room is full of
implicit biases and structural prejudices
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not necessarily bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just present.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white man, born and raised in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a loaded thing to be, and there is
a lot in there that as you work through it
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow through it and recognize those
biases, you're like, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made a free choice in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't really free of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for scientists, that's a huge
challenge because you're trying to create
[SPEAKER_00]: this objective view of the world and just
see it for its data points, but it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to see data points outside of our own
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily buy into objectivity
so much as what I call multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: subjectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need multiple truths to inform a common
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's related.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question that I keep coming back to
of what do you know and how do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it, is philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is epistemology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also not a philosopher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you who got there first or
the history of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes more from this recognition that
so much of what we're trying to do as
[SPEAKER_00]: people is based on a faith in objectivity,
a belief that there is something happening
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is something happening
outside of ourselves, but how do we access
[SPEAKER_00]: it from within ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the interesting place that
artists actually can play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Art, certainly in the West, has been
looking inward the last few hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become very reflective and very
inward looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the romantic reaction to
science looking outward and analyzing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and breaking it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, to our conversation this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can come back together in some
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge to that is specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is so complex that you can't also
be artists, full-blown artists at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too late for me to become a
full-blown scientist because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding of it is that we should
have a philosopher in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have an artist in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have scientists in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have to then train ourselves into
an openness that our specialties have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, trained us away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned this desirability of
adjacencies or being near each other and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also the idea of the studio becoming
a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about that idea of shared facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm thinking of the things that we do,
we visualize, as scientists, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: special techniques of looking at some
microscopes, macroscopes, different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeing things at scales that aren't
natural for us to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have ways of presenting some
visualization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we all create stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all ask stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think of negotiating that inquiry,
what is the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to make stuff, like when we
shared ability to use the same whatever 3D
[SPEAKER_01]: printer or laser cutter or whatever it is
that you're making stuff out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it beyond adjacency into shared toolkit
so that actually you're working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same media, with the same images?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be beyond just sitting next to
each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the implications of the narrative
research, the film-based research that I
[SPEAKER_00]: came upon almost right away was that the
tools are insufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the tools that I use for filmmaking
are made for making films that I put out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the world as linear pieces of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's non-linear media like
algorithmic editors that you can put on
[SPEAKER_00]: the web, but they're all product-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about making a product and
publishing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I started thinking about
is we need new tools for filmmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started to imagine every artist is
going to come up against this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they reframe their practice as not
art-making but as knowledge production,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to need new tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists, you may already have those
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I know I need technologists to help me
build those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the technologists are serving a
market and the market tells them that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need Adobe Premiere to cut a feature film.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a thing that makes this map for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be able to code things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff is actually based on
social scientists tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of coding is a social science
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are social science pieces of
software that let me code text and
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see in that the beginning of coming
into a science lab and being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I could use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artists are all about repurposing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could repurpose some of the tools that
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe if we're adjacent to each other,
we recognize that you need tools that
[SPEAKER_00]: artists have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need hybrid tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a third component that is
to be determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we created these interdisciplinary,
really collaborative open spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the first things that will
emerge from them are an entirely new
[SPEAKER_00]: family of tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is more about the data you are
collecting from being an artist in another
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I come from Europe and there is
already a lot of programs going on for
[SPEAKER_01]: residencies, grants, putting collaboration
sheets between artists and scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all now Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm part of different programs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is more for me is like,
I'm not part of what you call the art
[SPEAKER_01]: market at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like this in between residencies
and there is a lot of art centers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: on this kind of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the question is more about the
things you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in between all the knowledge you
get from the different kinds of sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get this in your way that is
very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is useful for other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have the net, as you say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, but we can't share this,
which is not the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the time you are sharing everyday
life with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really my question now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So artist residencies, especially in the
United States, are problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get a year-long artist residency
right now, like in New York City,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are public artists in residencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the most progressive program
in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can spend a year in any city
agency as an artist in residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get like $5,000 and a cubicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a scientist in residence,
if I'm a demographer in the demographics
[SPEAKER_00]: office, or if I'm a social scientist,
you're gonna get a salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of it is that, so on the one hand
it's like artists have, we've been kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tamed into accepting that as okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is because we aren't
really sure what our value is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm gonna go in there and every
artist, so I work specifically with
[SPEAKER_00]: artists in residence so that, so I'm their
impact producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the coding on their audience texts,
on their process texts, on their producer
[SPEAKER_00]: texts, and on their artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like draw the data out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the artist is like, oh wow,
I never knew all this was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to shape it to that
agency or that organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they wanna report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants a deliverable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the deliverable of an artist's
residency tends to be like decorations on
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall, like feel good events,
and positive PR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a big evil bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an artist in residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that artist in residence was
producing data, was producing knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether in the form of reports or
artworks, standalone artworks on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own, knowledge in an audience,
experience with the public, that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: economically valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That artists could do that full time and
they could do it for a salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would change our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If artists were not in a state of economic
desperation, where we are all best friends
[SPEAKER_00]: until we have to stab each other in the
back to get the gallery show and then
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody likes you anymore, but now you're
collected by an oil tycoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reality artists face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where art schools are pointing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's like career services.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a gallery show?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you enter the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of what do you do at a residency
to prove your worth and to transform that
[SPEAKER_00]: agency or that organization, wherever that
residency is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of the problem that is with
scientists, that we have been trained in
[SPEAKER_01]: years to get the papers out, to have a
place in the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that's been in touch for a
while over with us is the structure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we live in.
So it's sort of a force of mind issue that
maybe you could register yourself in and
start a thread where scientists can answer
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to claim I know it
because I don't firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think ultimately capitalism is
going to insist that we have deliverables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for scientists, it's a career with
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For artists, it's a career in a gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that unifies us is that all
we want to do is learn and build a body of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that we can pass on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need an economy that values that for
both of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

Thank you.
