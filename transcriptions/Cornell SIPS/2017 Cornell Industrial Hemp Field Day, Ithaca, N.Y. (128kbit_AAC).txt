[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Don Vians.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a professor in plant breeding and
genetics in the School of Integrative
[SPEAKER_10]: Plant Sciences here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've put together a program for our
first hemp field day ever, where
[SPEAKER_10]: fortunately we have some nice looking hemp
for you to be able to see.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I noticed everybody was kind of
roaming around looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll have opportunity to do that a
little bit later on as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have a lineup of some of us here
from Cornell who are working with hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have quite a few people,
and the number of people who are growing,
[SPEAKER_10]: who are interested in working on different
aspects of hemp in terms of research and
[SPEAKER_10]: extension.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also have Chris Logue, who I'm not
sure he's here yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: But oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's from the Department of Agriculture
and Markets, who is going to be talking a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit later on about the potential
uses, the marketing of hemp, and also some
[SPEAKER_10]: of the regulatory issues that growers need
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed that looking at the list of all
of you who have signed up or enrolled
[SPEAKER_10]: online for this field day, that there's a
wide variety of backgrounds that you come
[SPEAKER_10]: from and interests that you have about
hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I would like to do is to keep this
informal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly there are half a dozen or so of
us who are going to be giving talks.
[SPEAKER_10]: But to keep it informal such that as you
have questions or even comments or want to
[SPEAKER_10]: get into discussion about anything,
just barge in at any time to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be more fun if this was more
of a two-way discussion or a multiple way
[SPEAKER_10]: discussion than if it's just us up here
lecturing to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have Assemblywoman Donna Lopardo,
who is somewhere close by, but I don't
[SPEAKER_10]: think she's here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There she is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's just waving her hand there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to recognize her because she is
the one who initiated all of the
[SPEAKER_10]: discussions about industrial hemp and the
potential uses here in New York State and
[SPEAKER_10]: the subsequent legislation and essentially
paved the way for us to be able to,
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, without her, we wouldn't be having
this field day right now essentially.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's give her a round of applause for
what she's done.
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly any time that you want to
contribute to the discussion, feel free to
[SPEAKER_10]: jump right on in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, we'll keep this very informal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I'd like to do is to start out by
just telling you how we got into this
[SPEAKER_10]: research here at Cornell University in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it started last year with the
Department of Agriculture and Markets,
[SPEAKER_10]: who made some funding available to us to
start out by evaluating varieties of
[SPEAKER_10]: industrial hemp that come from Canada and
Europe by and large and to see which ones
[SPEAKER_10]: will perform the best under our conditions
in New York State until we have time to
[SPEAKER_10]: actually do some breeding specifically for
New York State conditions.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what this set of trials is all
about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, there are a couple of people who
will explain more about this a little
[SPEAKER_10]: while from now, so I won't try to steal
their thunder.
[SPEAKER_10]: But by the time we went through all the
regulatory approval process that had to be
[SPEAKER_10]: done in tandem, we couldn't do it all at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't until late August of last year
that we were able to actually purchase
[SPEAKER_10]: some seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously that's too late to get some
good experiments going.
[SPEAKER_10]: But my research crew planned out some
small trials only about a mile in that
[SPEAKER_10]: direction from here at the first of
September last year, not to really get
[SPEAKER_10]: good data on harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, by the time that froze sometime in
November, it was only about six or eight
[SPEAKER_10]: inches tall.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least it gave us a chance to see
how well we could establish some
[SPEAKER_10]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually tried out two different
planters and got some good data.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a little experience behind us
before doing the real trials this summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see behind me that it was very
successful in establishing a good trial
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what last year was all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I'd like to do is to turn this
over to Dr. Chris Smart to describe more
[SPEAKER_10]: of what the research plans are for us here
at Cornell and not only what we're doing
[SPEAKER_10]: now, but what we plan to do in the future
and what's happening in terms of
[SPEAKER_10]: production around the state in regards to
research.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris is a professor in the section of
plant pathology and plant microbiology in
[SPEAKER_10]: the School of Integrated Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's the one who's coordinating all
that we're doing here with Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_10]: in our college.
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, she's also a director.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're interim director,
but essentially you're a director.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today is the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So she is a director of the School of
Integrated Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, thank you, Don, and welcome,
everyone, to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is a really remarkable hemp
trial.
[SPEAKER_27]: Don and his crew have done a great job.
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of the research that we're doing
here, we now at Cornell, well,
[SPEAKER_27]: let me give you a bit of a history.
[SPEAKER_27]: Last year in 2016, there were 15 or 16
states across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_27]: that had industrial hemp research projects
this year.
[SPEAKER_27]: And Don's group was one of them.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was really fantastic that he was.
[SPEAKER_27]: This year, there's 31 states.
[SPEAKER_27]: So industrial hemp is booming,
and we have a lot of folks to collaborate
[SPEAKER_27]: with across the country.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's really nice that the state has
enabled us to jump in and really get on
[SPEAKER_27]: the wave of industrial hemp that's
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of what we're doing, we now have
11 scientists at Cornell that they and
[SPEAKER_27]: folks in their labs have projects on
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_27]: Last year this time, we had one.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the state has definitely got us
enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_27]: We also have 10 educators from Cornell
Cooperative Extension across the state
[SPEAKER_27]: that are involved in bringing information
to growers about how to grow hemp and what
[SPEAKER_27]: can we do this year in terms of hemp and
where are we looking to the future.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of some of the research that
we'll be doing, there is a research
[SPEAKER_27]: project, actually, that is run through
Cornell, but it's actually a state-funded
[SPEAKER_27]: project.
[SPEAKER_27]: This year, there are 29 farms that are
involved in the research project.
[SPEAKER_27]: These are farms that are all growing the
same variety of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_27]: That variety is Anka.
[SPEAKER_27]: The reason we chose Anka was not some
amazing scientific literature-driven
[SPEAKER_27]: reason.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's really the seed that we could get a
hold of at the time we decided to do this
[SPEAKER_27]: large-scale project.
[SPEAKER_27]: But it is a dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_27]: Variety of hemp.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it'll be interesting to see how it does
on these 29 different farms.
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of the research, we know what the
history of the land that Anka is being
[SPEAKER_27]: grown on.
[SPEAKER_27]: We know we have soil tests and we'll have
weather data.
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll have yield data.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll know really how this variety
does.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have farms from Lake Erie all the way
down to Long Island.
[SPEAKER_27]: Growers are amazingly entrepreneurial.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have growers that are growing for fiber
and for seed.
[SPEAKER_27]: We also have growers that are growing
plants in the greenhouse and transplanting
[SPEAKER_27]: them out to extract the medicinal
compounds, the non-hallucinogenic,
[SPEAKER_27]: non-THC medicinal compounds, and they'll
be selling those.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we have growers that are actually
harvesting two to three-week-old plants
[SPEAKER_27]: and using them for baby greens in salads
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I've been amazingly impressed,
again, continually, by the growers in the
[SPEAKER_27]: state of New York.
[SPEAKER_27]: How entrepreneurial you folks are and all
the different uses and creative ways that
[SPEAKER_27]: you can find to thrive in this farming
environment.
[SPEAKER_27]: It has been a tough year.
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_27]: My background is in plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_27]: I study diseases of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you're a vegetable grower,
you know it's been a tough year.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's been hard to get in because of all
the rain.
[SPEAKER_27]: But our growers have gotten the hemp in.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's gotten in late.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll be enthusiastic to see what we
learn at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of other research projects,
Larry Smart, who's a plant breeder in the
[SPEAKER_27]: School of Integrative Plant Science as
well, he and Don Vions are going to be
[SPEAKER_27]: establishing a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things that we learned this
year, Don's group knew last year,
[SPEAKER_27]: is that because of the permitting issues
that Chris Logue will talk about,
[SPEAKER_27]: moving seed across state or country lines
can be extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so it would be really great to
establish a seed production industry here
[SPEAKER_27]: in New York so that New York growers can
buy seed produced in New York,
[SPEAKER_27]: alleviating some of the permitting issues.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that will be coming online.
[SPEAKER_27]: But just starting a breeding program from
scratch takes time.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we're also working with local seed
companies to try to find ways to import
[SPEAKER_27]: the seed more smoothly than what happened
this year.
[SPEAKER_27]: Additionally, in that program,
we will be establishing a THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_27]: CBDs are the non-halucinogenic compounds,
medicinal compounds, produced by hemp.
[SPEAKER_27]: A testing facility that hopefully a year
from now both researchers and growers will
[SPEAKER_27]: be able to use to determine what varieties
have higher levels of those medicinal
[SPEAKER_27]: compounds when grown here in New York.
[SPEAKER_27]: So those compounds do change depending on
the environment, depending on water
[SPEAKER_27]: content, and depending on heat.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's going to be an important aspect
of our program.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a plant pathologist that's going
to be studying plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have an entomologist that's looking at
insects.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a system scientist who's looking
at how hemp fits into a rotational system.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have also I, along with a
microbiologist, are looking at the
[SPEAKER_27]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_27]: You've heard that, you know, what's in
your gut and on your skin helps make you
[SPEAKER_27]: who you are, healthy and things like that.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we're actually going to be looking
at the microbiome of hemp.
[SPEAKER_27]: To see what kind of microbes grow on hemp
and how that might impact some of the
[SPEAKER_27]: products that we get out of it.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's some of the research that we're
going to be doing at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're really excited actually just to
be involved with the growers and to learn
[SPEAKER_27]: from you guys, you know, what your needs
are, but also what you're learning on your
[SPEAKER_27]: farms and how we can bring that back and
feed those questions and those solutions
[SPEAKER_27]: into our research program.
[SPEAKER_27]: I also want to say that we do have
another, a field day in Geneva on Tuesday,
[SPEAKER_27]: August 15th.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the Geneva plots, we have, Cornell has
a campus in Geneva, it's about an hour
[SPEAKER_27]: north of here.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have four trials here that Dawn's
group will talk about today.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have two identical trials to these four
in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_27]: And those trials don't look quite like
this.
[SPEAKER_27]: So when we're in Geneva, we'll actually be
talking about some of the struggles that
[SPEAKER_27]: you might have if you're planting a hemp
crop.
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_27]: As I've heard, you know, some of the
researchers are like, wow, if I knew it
[SPEAKER_27]: was going to look like this, you know,
I'd grow it in a heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_27]: But what happens when a field gets drowned
out?
[SPEAKER_27]: What do things look like?
[SPEAKER_27]: What disease and insect purchase do you
have and things like that?
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll have some of the extension folks
there and we'll talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_27]: issues that you could have if you're
growing a hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_27]: And with that, I think I would turn it
over to, is it your folks?
[SPEAKER_27]: Back to Dawn.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of you who have stood up close to the
hemp here may have noticed that these
[SPEAKER_10]: green varieties here that are in bloom,
there's a lot of bees in there,
[SPEAKER_10]: bumblebees and honeybees and so forth.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really doing a lot of pollinating
and a lot of hemp for the pollen source.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also was thinking as I came out this
morning and I was looking not straight in
[SPEAKER_10]: this way, but from the other direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: This stand is so thick that you could
easily use this for, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: like to have corn mazes and stuff like
that, the pathways.
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe once the regulations allow for
that to happen, we could have hemp mazes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens in the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, we're going to have a couple of
people from our research program talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about the actual trials that are going on
here to evaluate varieties for our
[SPEAKER_10]: conditions here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to introduce two people to
come up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie Crawford, who I really have to
acknowledge has done a lot of work to make
[SPEAKER_10]: the logistics of all of these things that
we're doing with hemp happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's been very instrumental to pulling
off a lot of things there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jamie is a research support specialist
on the Forge Breeding Project,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is the project that I lead,
but of course now we're into hemp research
[SPEAKER_10]: as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And along with her is Amelia Yaffe,
who is actually completing an internship
[SPEAKER_10]: with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's actually from SUNY at Cobo Scale and
has to do an internship in order to
[SPEAKER_10]: complete her degree requirements there at
Cobo Scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: So she became interested in industrial
hemp, and we took her on as an intern to
[SPEAKER_10]: work with the hemp project this summer and
has done a lot of really nice things
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to turn it over to the two of
them.
[SPEAKER_30]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_30]: I have a bunch of things to tell you,
and I knew I'd forget, so you have
[SPEAKER_30]: actually a handout for what I'm going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_30]: It's called 2017 Industrial Hemp Trials.
[SPEAKER_30]: So the very first table on that sheet
shows you our different locations for our
[SPEAKER_30]: trials and the planting dates.
[SPEAKER_30]: So the trial you see behind me right here,
this one was planted June 9th.
[SPEAKER_30]: And you can see it's done very,
very well.
[SPEAKER_30]: The one directly behind me, this is our
grain and dual-purpose variety trial.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then we also had four entries that are
exclusive fiber varieties.
[SPEAKER_30]: And so those are the next block down.
[SPEAKER_30]: So those of you interested in fiber should
go and check those out as well.
[SPEAKER_30]: So you can see we've planted, well,
Chris had mentioned how far behind the
[SPEAKER_30]: trials were in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_30]: They were planted later.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we planted a second trial on this exact
same soil type the day after we planted
[SPEAKER_30]: the first Geneva trial.
[SPEAKER_30]: And that is what's down at the far end.
[SPEAKER_30]: So you could be able to see a little bit
of a difference.
[SPEAKER_30]: A difference three weeks can make.
[SPEAKER_30]: The varieties are still photo period
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_30]: So you can see that even though they are
much shorter, they're still starting to
[SPEAKER_30]: flower at about the same time.
[SPEAKER_30]: Within the last two weeks, luckily we've
had two people from different Canadian
[SPEAKER_30]: seed companies come and visit us.
[SPEAKER_30]: And they've said that even though it's
planted later, it will still be harvested.
[SPEAKER_30]: So since there's a three-week difference
in planting, there'll probably be a week
[SPEAKER_30]: and a half difference in harvesting time.
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's not the full three-week difference
for the harvest.
[SPEAKER_30]: So you can see our other trials on here.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we have one other trial here in Ithaca
that was planted on what I would call a
[SPEAKER_30]: challenging soil.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we planted a trial on it last year.
[SPEAKER_30]: And what we planted was a grain drill.
[SPEAKER_30]: So it was planted about a one-inch seeding
depth.
[SPEAKER_30]: It just didn't come up at all.
[SPEAKER_30]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we planted it this year with a forage
seeder aiming for about a half-inch
[SPEAKER_30]: seeding depth.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then bad luck, right?
[SPEAKER_30]: About two days after we planted it,
we got a rain and then two nights in the
[SPEAKER_30]: 40s.
[SPEAKER_30]: And so the emergence in that field is not
what you see here.
[SPEAKER_30]: It's sort of an understatement.
[SPEAKER_30]: In the trial right behind me, we're
averaging between 10 and 18 seedlings per
[SPEAKER_30]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_30]: And on that other trial I was just talking
about, we were averaging between four and
[SPEAKER_30]: seven seedlings per square foot.
[SPEAKER_30]: So it was a big difference, a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then we have the two trials planted in
Geneva, one of them on a moderate
[SPEAKER_30]: well-drained soil, and on a somewhat
poorly-drained soil.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we know we have those in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then our last trial is on a gravel.
[SPEAKER_30]: It's the only one that had a lot of rocks.
[SPEAKER_30]: So our last trial was planted in an
organic system in Freeville.
[SPEAKER_30]: And so that was rotating out of red
clover.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then we planted hemp into it.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we're really looking forward to what we
see in that one.
[SPEAKER_30]: So the plots behind me, each one is well,
this is sort of the joke.
[SPEAKER_30]: One of the students pointed it out to me
after I was printed out there.
[SPEAKER_30]: So our plots are four feet by 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_30]: So everyone can make a 420 joke there.
[SPEAKER_30]: You have to have one at a hemp meeting,
right?
[SPEAKER_30]: And then each entry is replicated four
times throughout each trial.
[SPEAKER_30]: Like I said, we were aiming with our grain
drill for about three-quarters of an inch
[SPEAKER_30]: for seeding depth in all of our trials,
except for the East Ithaca one,
[SPEAKER_30]: where we aim for half an inch.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then if you want to look at the back,
you can see a list of the varieties that
[SPEAKER_30]: we have in the trials.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we've got 13 varieties that are listed
as grain or dual-purpose.
[SPEAKER_30]: So the ones you see on the signs here,
the four fiber entries, which you can see
[SPEAKER_30]: down there.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then there's also some contact
information for the seed companies that we
[SPEAKER_30]: got these varieties from.
[SPEAKER_30]: So for future trials, we do hope to get
more entries.
[SPEAKER_30]: We want to be able to show for the farmers
of New York State the full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_30]: what's available to them.
[SPEAKER_30]: So there's a couple other seed companies
in Canada that ran out of seed this year.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we're hoping to get some of their
entries from Parkland for next year.
[SPEAKER_30]: So next, Amelia is going to talk to you a
little bit about some of the notes that
[SPEAKER_30]: we've taken.
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_30]: That would not be commercially available
to farmers right now.
[SPEAKER_30]: Like, the purpose of these trials right
now is to see what farmers can purchase
[SPEAKER_30]: and plant in their fields right now.
[SPEAKER_30]: So like, yeah, I'm trying to talk to you
about the variety trials that we have.
[SPEAKER_30]: That's part of a future breeding program,
right?
[SPEAKER_30]: So the whole idea, we would, of course,
you know, native hemp varieties are of
[SPEAKER_30]: interest in breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_30]: But for the trials, like, this is what a
farmer can get seed of and plant next
[SPEAKER_30]: spring.
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's what we need to show.
[SPEAKER_30]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_30]: Before I pass?
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think it will ever get quite this
tall.
[SPEAKER_30]: They were... I can answer that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Once it starts the photo period change,
it stops its growth upward, produces
[SPEAKER_19]: flower or seed.
[SPEAKER_30]: The gentleman who came last week,
he is the one who markets Anka.
[SPEAKER_30]: So Ruben Stone, he was saying that they
have areas where they've planted Anka
[SPEAKER_30]: beginning of May, and that's like 15 feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_30]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, right there, there are a few riders
that are photo-period insensitive.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that one up in Canada,
that's what was called the source of the
[SPEAKER_10]: math, was photo-period insensitive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what Larry's part actually
wants to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that's stay neutral yet,
but that would be one of the first goals
[SPEAKER_02]: of the breeding program here.
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, so I'll bring in Amelia, and she's
going to talk about some of the notes that
[SPEAKER_30]: we've taken on the trials so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, so I'm the research intern,
and with the help of some of our student
[SPEAKER_02]: employees, I've been collecting data on
our trials on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these data include notes on
heights, stand, and flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, all of our varieties are
in bloom now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fiber may just be beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fiber varieties have been much slower
to begin, and something I've noticed is
[SPEAKER_02]: there's vast differences between our
monaceous and dioecious varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: and for those of you who don't know,
dioecious varieties are the ones that have
[SPEAKER_02]: male and female plants that are separate,
and monaceous plants produce male and
[SPEAKER_02]: female parts on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our dioecious varieties began to
bloom sooner, and they did so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorously at first, and then their growth
sort of slowed down, whereas the monaceous
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties have continued to grow a lot
more at a much more steady and linear
[SPEAKER_02]: rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plan on combining our grain and
dual-purpose varieties in the fall when
[SPEAKER_02]: about 70% of the seeds are mature,
so we're expecting to do that probably
[SPEAKER_02]: September, October, and our fiber trial
will be harvested when 20% flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all we have for now.
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a note in one of your handouts
that monaceous are only used for breeding.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not generally put in the field.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just curious why.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because you said a comment that said
monaceous cultivars are generally only
[SPEAKER_20]: grown by plant breeders, is that that
they're just not as advanced, or is that
[SPEAKER_20]: they produce less seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that that's true,
because a lot of people prefer monaceous
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties because they won't lose 40% of
their crop due to that male plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: Will you be using the seed from these in
future plantings?
[SPEAKER_18]: What about cross-pollination between any
of them?
[SPEAKER_30]: No.
[SPEAKER_30]: No, we plant certified seed in our trials,
and so we won't be saving any seed.
[SPEAKER_30]: We will test the quality of these seeds
for different oil production, but when it
[SPEAKER_30]: comes to planting again, we're going back
to the certified seed bags.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me just point out that it is in fact
illegal to save the seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_27]: It has to do with Federal DEA permitting.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not an intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is.
[SPEAKER_27]: There are some varieties that you will
sign an MTA with, but it's also illegal.
[SPEAKER_27]: At least our permit does not allow us to
hold the seeds.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you have a license to do that,
then it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_27]: The question was, can you clone the
plants?
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you put them into tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's absolutely something that we're
going to be doing here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, the director of our tissue
culture facility is here today.
[SPEAKER_27]: But you have to have the appropriate
licensing, from the company who sold you
[SPEAKER_27]: the seed, and you also have to have the
appropriate permits so that Matthew
[SPEAKER_27]: doesn't get thrown in jail.
[SPEAKER_27]: We like you, but we like you, Matthew.
[SPEAKER_21]: Will breeding efforts focus on varieties
or strategies that won't necessarily incur
[SPEAKER_21]: as many licensing issues or material
transfer agreements for farmers?
[SPEAKER_02]: That will not occur?
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, eventually, ideally people
will be able to save seeds.
[SPEAKER_21]: And won't be breeding from varieties that
might previously have such restrictions on
[SPEAKER_21]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't quite hear the whole question
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Something about breeding what?
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, some of these varieties,
I have licensing agreements that you can't
[SPEAKER_21]: repeatedly save seed.
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that legally towards the companies that
own the variety on top of better
[SPEAKER_21]: regulation?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That happens with most crop species,
even with alfalfa that you see the plots
[SPEAKER_10]: behind you there that we work with on our
project as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially the private companies will go
through what's called plant variety
[SPEAKER_10]: protection.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some will actually patent their varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's a legal process.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that makes sure that you or I cannot
pirate their seed and call it our own
[SPEAKER_10]: variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: They put all the expense into the research
and development of that variety and
[SPEAKER_10]: producing the seed and so forth.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to protect it so that they can
get some payback so that it continues with
[SPEAKER_10]: their efforts there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just part of the legal
protection system.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not part of the drug enforcement
agency or anything like that, but it's
[SPEAKER_10]: just part of the system to make sure that
companies are protecting their own
[SPEAKER_10]: interests and so forth.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm just wondering if you then breed
off of varieties that have those
[SPEAKER_21]: protections, do those just continue
forward?
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we do that, we need to go to that
company and ask if they would allow us to
[SPEAKER_10]: do that and sign an agreement.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, we'd have to pay them a
royalty on any varieties that we develop
[SPEAKER_10]: from their materials.
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually there's a royalty basis per pound
of seed, you know, so many cents per pound
[SPEAKER_10]: of seed that we have to pay back to them.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple of patent attorney over
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple of different issues going
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: You may actually be able to patent a gene
sequence.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't patent the whole genome,
but you might be able to patent the
[SPEAKER_13]: sequence that gives it a particular
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_13]: In that case, any of us wouldn't be able
to grow a hemp plant with that particular
[SPEAKER_13]: gene sequence in it because then we would
be violating their patent.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you enter into a license agreement
with one of these companies, then there's
[SPEAKER_13]: potentially additional restrictions on top
of whether or not you can actually breed
[SPEAKER_13]: with their plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Technically, you know, by the patent law
itself, if you breed with their plant and
[SPEAKER_13]: then produce something without that
patented gene sequence, you might
[SPEAKER_13]: technically be okay by the patent laws,
but by the license agreement, you might
[SPEAKER_13]: not be okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions about anything related
to that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any plans to test auto flowers
for oil?
[SPEAKER_09]: Auto flower?
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't thought about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I haven't, but that might be an
interesting thing to do.
[SPEAKER_30]: So for the seed cost, it's probably $2.50
to $3 a pound for the seed.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then you pay for all of the testing
that they have to do through APHIS to get
[SPEAKER_30]: it imported to the United States.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then the shipping is expensive on top
of that.
[SPEAKER_30]: And then, I don't know, what did we work
it out to, Chris?
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you remember, like, it was?
[SPEAKER_27]: $50, roughly $50 an acre.
[SPEAKER_30]: He had roughly $50 an acre for the seed
cost.
[SPEAKER_30]: That was for ANCA.
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, that was also when we bought it in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we bought 51,000 pounds of it and got
it at about $50.
[SPEAKER_30]: So it would be about $50 per acre.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many pounds per acre?
[SPEAKER_09]: 30.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, so the question was, how many pounds
per acre?
[SPEAKER_27]: And we were planning at 30 pounds per
acre, which was about the $50 range.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition to testing for the oil quality
and the fiber content, will you take a
[SPEAKER_17]: look at the pharmaceutical value of this
crop, even though I know it's not intended
[SPEAKER_17]: for that purpose?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we're very interested in doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we would like to do is that,
I mean, SUNY Binghamton has a
[SPEAKER_10]: pharmaceutical school now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we talked to them about a year ago
about interest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they're working with some other
people now, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we would like to get some people
interested in looking at that.
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the question was, I think, if I heard
it right, I think the question was,
[SPEAKER_27]: are we going to be looking at other
non-THC medicinal compounds?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: So this year, again, we're getting that up
and running.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll just do it as a one-shot deal.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have at Cornell our BRC BioResource
Center.
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll be gearing up for that.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll test for THC.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then for the cannabinoids panel.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then next year, the idea is that we'd
have more time to plan a more rigorous
[SPEAKER_27]: scientific study.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we would probably do different
timings.
[SPEAKER_27]: But at least for this year, we'll get
information from the 17 varieties,
[SPEAKER_27]: at least a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll do that for each of our six
locations that has the varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for clarifying that, Chris.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because yeah, we're not doing everything
this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our initial year.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the future, we would like to do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don, same question I asked you before
about harvesting equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to sort of throw it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys have, what are you guys doing
for combines or making adjustments to your
[SPEAKER_08]: combines?
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's any specialty equipment you
guys are looking into, or if anyone has.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I think that's a general question
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ed and I were talking about that before we
started here, about harvest equipment that
[SPEAKER_10]: you use.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would probably be different for the
fiber varieties versus the grain and dual
[SPEAKER_10]: purpose varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've heard, I've read that people
have used the combine for the grain and
[SPEAKER_10]: dual purpose types.
[SPEAKER_10]: But sometimes there can be some problems
with all that stock material wrapping
[SPEAKER_10]: around the components of the combine.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody have any experience with that or
thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_31]: I know a farmer in Vermont that actually
left a remainder of the hemp field because
[SPEAKER_31]: it took about two or three days just to
combine four acres.
[SPEAKER_31]: And they had to repeatedly stop and unwind
the combine and re-sharpen the blades and
[SPEAKER_31]: whatnot because the fiber was just too
much for their John Deere combine.
[SPEAKER_31]: So that could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_31]: And I know that's a common issue
throughout the hemp industry right now,
[SPEAKER_31]: is the harvesting of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so that's something where some
agricultural engineers could come in handy
[SPEAKER_10]: to work out that system.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is, I mean, obviously there's a
lot of fiber in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even in the grain types, there's a lot of
fiber.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, otherwise this tall material
wouldn't stand up like it would.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're just catching up with the
rest of the world here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there machines in other countries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_25]: My company is associated with some
partners from the University of Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we've been doing this in China.
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been doing this in China for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_25]: But essentially, you could buy a piece of
machinery that actually separates all of
[SPEAKER_25]: it.
[SPEAKER_25]: Seeds, oil, any part of the stack.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions before we go on to the
next speaker?
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm curious what you'll be doing next year
or any research on the systems work,
[SPEAKER_29]: what follows hemp well, how to deal with
all the fiber in the field for next year?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, Chris can help me answer
that because she and Larry Smart have been
[SPEAKER_10]: thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, one of the things that we want to
do, too, right now we just have these
[SPEAKER_10]: variety trials just on Cornell land.
[SPEAKER_10]: We would like to spread that out some
throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, right now several producers are
just growing on ANCA.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we would like to get some variety
trials more widespread so we can get a
[SPEAKER_10]: better idea of the best varieties for New
York state conditions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just on our experimental farmland.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Chris, I don't know if you want to
contribute more to that.
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you guys all hear me?
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yeah, in terms of on-farm or
rotational strategies, there's a
[SPEAKER_27]: scientist, Matt Ryan, who's in the soil
and crop science section of SIPS.
[SPEAKER_27]: And he's going to be looking at
integrating hemp into his system study.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then in addition to that, I think,
you know, one of the things that we can do
[SPEAKER_27]: fairly easily is right now we're looking
at what is hemp following at the 29 farms.
[SPEAKER_27]: And there are some interesting things
because there were some growers that,
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, sprayed and were ready to prep
for soybean.
[SPEAKER_27]: But they couldn't get their soybean in
because of the rain.
[SPEAKER_27]: And now they're putting hemp in.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll be able to tell, you know,
do the herbicides that were put on to prep
[SPEAKER_27]: for soybean, are they an issue for hemp?
[SPEAKER_27]: So in some ways, the 29 farms are helping
us with that.
[SPEAKER_27]: The other thing that will be helped with
is that we can go back to them next year
[SPEAKER_27]: and see if they're having issues.
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, what are they following and are
they having issues?
[SPEAKER_27]: So we can follow that for a while.
[SPEAKER_27]: So right now, we are developing our
systems approach, but we can use the 29
[SPEAKER_27]: farms sort of as a real-life, you know,
scientific study to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_27]: And any of you, you know, once you guys
start growing hemp and, you know,
[SPEAKER_27]: anything that you found has affected the
hemp, either that you did before the hemp
[SPEAKER_27]: goes in the ground or after it's coming
off going in the next year.
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, that's all really valuable
information that, you know, we hope to
[SPEAKER_27]: learn from you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions before we move on?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_30]: I was curious to know if you watered this
or if you just relied on rain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we've had plenty of rain.
[SPEAKER_10]: You did irrigate it once to start with,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_30]: We had one dry spell in June.
[SPEAKER_30]: And at that time, we weren't sure the DEA
was going to allow us to plant in all of
[SPEAKER_30]: our locations.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we were like, we need this to survive.
[SPEAKER_30]: So we did irrigate it for, I don't know,
just a couple hours, one morning at the
[SPEAKER_30]: very early seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_30]: But none of the other trials were
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_30]: We just were just like, we need this to
survive.
[SPEAKER_30]: What happens if it cooks?
[SPEAKER_30]: And so there was an act of desperation
here just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_30]: And it turns out it probably would have
been fine.
[SPEAKER_30]: But none of the other trials have been
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, it's been an unusual year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year was so dry and this year is so
wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you put the two years together,
it averages out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's not the way the plants act.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't work on averages.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, with all the rain that we've
had this season, each week we wonder,
[SPEAKER_10]: well, is the fall is going to turn off and
then it's going to turn dry the rest of
[SPEAKER_10]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you just never know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it just keeps on going.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, we got this planted late,
later maybe several weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe a month later than what we really
wanted to plant it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yet it's growing very tall.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, we've had plenty of
moisture to keep it going this season.
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any faculty positions opening
up at Cornell or anyone know for cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of people are kind of taking
on this as a new plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what about people who specialize in
hemp and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to turn that over to Chris.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not aware of any new faculty
positions right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_27]: We do have new faculty positions.
[SPEAKER_27]: But the ones that we have right now are
not hemp related.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shouldn't they be?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, so I think actually, to answer that
question quite seriously, I think that
[SPEAKER_27]: hiring a faculty member for a 30 or 40
year stent or a 20, 30 year stent,
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, is a serious endeavor.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that we don't know yet how
well hemp is going to do in New York.
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, this is really the first time that
it's been out.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, you know, I think we need to give
it a season or two to figure out how we
[SPEAKER_27]: plug that in to our research portfolio and
footprint across the state, you know,
[SPEAKER_27]: to make sure that, you know, we still have
folks that are working with our vegetable
[SPEAKER_27]: growers and our field crops growers,
you know, just to make sure we're very
[SPEAKER_27]: well-rounded.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, I think the people that are on
hemp are, you know, we're all in.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I feel like, you know, we're covering
it quite well.
[SPEAKER_27]: And in the future, if it continues to
expand, then we would certainly look into
[SPEAKER_27]: that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have the advantage that Chris
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: That there are 11 of us on the faculty
working on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're all coming from our different
areas of specializations put together as a
[SPEAKER_10]: package where we're cooperating together
to, you know, to look at the complete
[SPEAKER_10]: package.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's not just breeding or genetics,
but it's all different areas of research
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're working on here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really what it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's going to take the work
because it's not just one area of
[SPEAKER_10]: specialization that we need to be focusing
on, but we need to look at all aspects of
[SPEAKER_10]: production and so forth.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm curious, is there thought about
building communities in terms of worker
[SPEAKER_06]: cooperatives and such so that the
extraction devices and the processing
[SPEAKER_06]: devices can be brought back to the farm
farming communities?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where all the money is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's one thing to grow the
plant, but to make the action in the farm
[SPEAKER_06]: and to process into, you know,
the 500 different uses, that's where
[SPEAKER_06]: really the money is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if there's thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I'm not totally sure what your
question is about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bringing the equipment back to the farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for instance, in North Carolina,
there's a big movement about building
[SPEAKER_06]: worker cooperatives where they will buy
the extraction equipment so that that
[SPEAKER_06]: money stays on the farm, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing this in marijuana on the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmers don't make any money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all in the processing and building
the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm curious as to whether Lonell or
New York State is thoughtful in thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: about building those sort of
marketability.
[SPEAKER_27]: No,
[SPEAKER_23]: and I don't have an answer to that right
now.
[SPEAKER_23]: I am familiar with what's going on in
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know that any thoughts been given
to that yet.
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say, too, it's just too new yet so
far.
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I know Chris, where's Chris?
[SPEAKER_23]: He's going to be talking about talking
about processors towards the end of it,
[SPEAKER_23]: but I don't have an answer right now to
that.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a great question, though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me move on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have more opportunities for
questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not done yet this morning,
but let me move on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I introduce the next speaker,
though, I might mention some of you may
[SPEAKER_10]: have noticed or maybe you didn't notice
the tall fence that's around our
[SPEAKER_10]: experimental farm here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that fence is there because we have a
lot of deer problems around here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you see some forage species
behind you, alfalfa and so forth.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we didn't have some way to control the
deer, we wouldn't be able to collect the
[SPEAKER_10]: data for our research purposes that we
need to collect.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, people have asked me if deer are a
problem on hemp, and I really don't know
[SPEAKER_10]: the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't had experience with it yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have any of you heard anything about
whether deer will bother hemp at all?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_31]: In Vermont, I was told that the seedlings,
the deer really liked, but as the hemp
[SPEAKER_31]: grew tall and more fibrous, the deer just
liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Too much fiber in there.
[SPEAKER_31]: So, it might depend on the cultivar,
really.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if we didn't have this fence here,
they would be eating our alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_09]: but leaving the hemp alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know if it's mainly on young
growth?
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, he was growing for CBD, but he
didn't say at what point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm growing for CBD in Oregon,
and we've had no problem with deer at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have multiple, like four different
farms gone right now, different areas.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we've been very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_14]: None of them have passed that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did everybody hear that?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, he said in Oregon, they haven't had
any problems at all with deer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me introduce the next speaker.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, anytime you have more and more
acreage of any kind of a crop species,
[SPEAKER_10]: and right now, we don't have that,
a lot of acreage, but it's growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But whenever you have that, it's going to
be susceptible to various disease and
[SPEAKER_10]: insect problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Dr. Gary Burstrom, he's the chair of
the department, or of the section of plant
[SPEAKER_10]: pathology and plant microbiology within
the School of Integrative Plant Science,
[SPEAKER_10]: and he does a lot of research and
extension activities on diseases of field
[SPEAKER_10]: crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Elson Shields, our entomologist,
was going to be here, but he's,
[SPEAKER_10]: some things came up, and he's not able to
be here today, but he did tell me about a
[SPEAKER_10]: few insect problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, Gary, if you've seen any insects in
your, okay, I'll let you talk about
[SPEAKER_10]: diseases first.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I will confess that I'm a student of
hemp diseases at this point, and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn everything I can, along,
I suspect, with a lot of you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as Don said, I've worked in field
crops for a number of years, and we are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking forward to getting a better handle
and inventory on what some of the pest
[SPEAKER_03]: problems are on industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've also spent some time talking to
some colleagues in some other parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: country, and some of these recent visitors
from Canada about some of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: they've encountered.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, by and large, we're going to use
these variety plots in Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_03]: Geneva, and other places, and these
distributed farms across New York State to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to inventory all of the pest issues
that we find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And typical for a new crop like this,
a lot of these pathogens tend to be rather
[SPEAKER_03]: specific in the crop species that they
attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we could reasonably expect,
as we expand the acreage and intensity of
[SPEAKER_03]: the crop, we may not see a lot of these
pest problems now, but we can anticipate
[SPEAKER_03]: that they would increase the more that we
grow the crop intensively on a particular
[SPEAKER_03]: farm or more extensively.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think most of you are aware there
are no pesticides of any class used on the
[SPEAKER_03]: crop at this point, and that includes
fungicides, and that also includes seed
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment fungicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Alan Taylor is going to talk a little
bit later on the program about some seed
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things we would be concerned
about is what protection we need to get
[SPEAKER_03]: these seedlings out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing we have noticed in a number
of the locations, at fairly low incidence,
[SPEAKER_03]: not really causing an economic problem,
but we could see, even in this fairly dry
[SPEAKER_03]: season, we have seen a number of the water
mold pathogens attacking the seed and
[SPEAKER_03]: seedlings that under less favorable
conditions for sowing the crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: we could anticipate more problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the vast majority of field crops
and vegetables, except for strictly
[SPEAKER_03]: organic production, there's often a seed
applied fungicide or water mold active
[SPEAKER_03]: material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's something that we would be
looking at in the future as a possible
[SPEAKER_03]: means of controlling some of these
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also seen a fairly small incidence
of some wilting and crown and root
[SPEAKER_03]: symptoms at low incidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could share a whole long list of
Latin names with you of the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms that we're finding there,
but at this point, we're just taking an
[SPEAKER_03]: inventory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of this goes back to what Chris
was talking about, the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of fungi and bacteria and
other things that are just normally
[SPEAKER_03]: present.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to find some of these things
doesn't necessarily mean that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: causing some kind of a plague on
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, part of the research going forward
will be taking some of these organisms,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to inoculate them onto healthy
plants and seeing if they do cause
[SPEAKER_03]: disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And down the road, I mean, I'm very
excited about this breeding program
[SPEAKER_03]: that'll be going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look at some of the principal plant
pathogens that we find associated with the
[SPEAKER_03]: crop and maybe doing, or someone in the
future will be doing some purposeful
[SPEAKER_03]: screening of some of these varieties with
some of these potential pathogen problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been mentioned a couple of times
about cropping rotations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a plant pathologist, that's a
center focus for me, is not only can the
[SPEAKER_03]: organism survive in the soil, or
potentially come in with the seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in many cases, some of these organisms
will survive on the debris that's left
[SPEAKER_03]: behind in the field, and that'd be the
bridge from one growing season to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming back, what I said about the
specificity of many of these crop
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for instance, if we were planting this
crop after a grain crop, like corn or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, or a small grain,
there'd be very, very few organisms that
[SPEAKER_03]: would interact and cause problems on those
two crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: The closer they are related, so we could
expect some dicot plants to be a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more closely related to the hemp than some
of our monocots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be looking over time to
see if there's any carryover of some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that does concern me long term and has
been a problem in Canada and some other
[SPEAKER_03]: places is white mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fungal problem that is already
quite rampant in our legume crops and some
[SPEAKER_03]: of our other broadleaf vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in soybean production, probably our
biggest disease problem right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: sclerotinia, white mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very broad host-rage fungus,
and it survives the survival structures of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fungus called sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will survive in the soil for a number
of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so certainly white mold is something
we'll be looking at in the hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly in rotation, that would
include vegetable beans, dry beans,
[SPEAKER_03]: soybean, highly susceptible crops to white
mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rotations are very important in this
sense as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to talk at you a lot here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to make you aware that we're very
interested in learning more, first about
[SPEAKER_03]: what the diseases and potential disease
problems might be, and obviously the long
[SPEAKER_03]: term interest is how to manage those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will mention two people from my program,
Kevin Myers in the back here and Jamie
[SPEAKER_03]: Cummings will be working in our lab to do
a lot of the diagnosis of potential
[SPEAKER_03]: disease problems and work with this new
crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would be appreciative of anybody
seeing anything in their fields and
[SPEAKER_03]: letting us know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be glad to diagnose problems in our
laboratory, get out in your fields and
[SPEAKER_03]: look.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please keep us informed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let us know how we can be of help to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another thing, just to quickly say that
one of the main advantages against
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases is just the vigorous rapid growth
of this crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things I've learned
from talking to colleagues in other
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we see some leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we see some of this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the crop basically outgrows them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is an advantage with this crop,
that it's timely planted inappropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the main advantages of
this crop.
And that's one of the main advantages of
this crop.
And that's one of the main advantages of
this crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, we're not weed scientists
in our program, but Kevin has been taking
[SPEAKER_03]: some notes in the various plots about weed
density.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a great take home message here is a
tremendous correlation between the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: density in these plots and what the
original stand was from the success and
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence of those plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best defense against weeds,
especially in the absence of any
[SPEAKER_03]: herbicides to use, is just to have a good
crop establishment, have a good initial
[SPEAKER_03]: stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very often, this will be sufficient to
outcompete the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a pretty good strategy if you can do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions or comments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some observations others have made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, please.
[SPEAKER_18]: What is the closest normal plant in New
York that family relationship to hemp?
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say hops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hops would be the closest.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you then say that whatever attacks
hops, diseases, or pests is similarly
[SPEAKER_03]: probably going to... Only as a very
general statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even within a plant family, there's
tremendous specificity in these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some things that would be the
best candidates that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the things that attack through
the soil, the water molds, Fusaria,
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhysoctonia, some of these things tend to
have a fairly wide host range.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the leaf spotting type organisms
are really rather specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think things like the downy mildews,
Chris, would be pretty separate from the
[SPEAKER_03]: hops and the hemp in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more a pathogen is specialized,
the less we worry about that for related
[SPEAKER_03]: crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely that's something we'd be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some candidate things we'd
be looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still come back to white mold being
the biggest concern that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a very broad host range.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weeds as well as cultivated crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody observe anything on your farms at
this point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, keep us in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can help.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, David.
[SPEAKER_05]: In regard to some of the pests,
Farm Viability is funding Jen Gilbert
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenkins at Morrisville with some plots
this summer specifically to look at insect
[SPEAKER_05]: pests.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that she's doing much with
diseases, but certainly with insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: She might have some good information to
share as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Becker has been interacting with
her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have had a few things arrive at
either Chris's lab or mine in connection
[SPEAKER_03]: with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we would absolutely love to plug
in with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get all the learning we can out of
these plots that are established.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also provided funding for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's planning to do a statewide trial
next summer on fertilization in hemp and
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 different farms around the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we provided some funding for her to buy
the seed already for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don, would you like to say a few things
about what insects that...
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so again, Elson Shields has been
working on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in our entomology department.
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, he was not able to make
it here after all.
[SPEAKER_10]: But he did send me a list of a few insects
that he's observed in the hemp around the
[SPEAKER_10]: state so far.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them is a ligus bug.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's maybe a quarter inch big bug there
that eats the growing tips of the plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: but also the reproductive parts,
the floral parts of the plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: which obviously could be very critical on
the grain type.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the dual purpose types there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one of the things that he's
keeping a watch on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another insect, which is actually
prevalent on a lot of species,
[SPEAKER_10]: is potato leafhopper.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have problems with that on our
alfalfa if we don't spray an insecticide
[SPEAKER_10]: or use a resistant variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently, he's been seeing it on
industrial hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: A third one that he mentioned is thrips.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very, very small insect.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that can get into the floral parts.
[SPEAKER_10]: They eat pollen and so forth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the things, Elson didn't
mention it, but some of the things that
[SPEAKER_10]: I've read is that people are suspecting
that some of the major insect problems on
[SPEAKER_10]: corn could actually be a problem on hemp
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the validity of that or
whether people are speculating at this
[SPEAKER_10]: point.
[SPEAKER_10]: But things like corn armyworm and some
others there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is critical that entomologists be
looking, just like Gary does with the
[SPEAKER_10]: diseases there, that we have entomologists
looking at insect problems so that we know
[SPEAKER_10]: what challenges that we have.
[SPEAKER_10]: In front of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have questions about insects,
I probably can't answer them, but you can
[SPEAKER_10]: ask.
[SPEAKER_29]: I would think that the insect pressure
would build over time once there's more
[SPEAKER_29]: crop available.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same for diseases and insects.
[SPEAKER_10]: As the acreage increases across the state,
certainly there's potential for more
[SPEAKER_10]: problems to be there as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions or comments?
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so I'm going to turn this over then to
Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Taylor, one of the problems that we've
already been confronted with, there's one
[SPEAKER_10]: of these varieties in here, which I think
is this short one, is it Jamie,
[SPEAKER_10]: that had low germination?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these was anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it down there?
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the varieties was from seed
that was a year older than the rest of
[SPEAKER_10]: them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the germination rate was really low.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even though Jamie compensated with
that to have the same number of pure live
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds per square foot, so that we're
comparing apples and apples and not apples
[SPEAKER_10]: and oranges, still the stand density was
not as great as some of the other
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the seed's important.
[SPEAKER_10]: As Gary said, we need to get a good stand
establishment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're very pleased that Dr. Allen
Taylor from the horticulture section in
[SPEAKER_10]: the School of Integrative Plant Science is
working on the seed aspects of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Don, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Chris mentioned, there's a number of
states that really have doing research on
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a colleague of mine from North Dakota
State as an agronomist was giving a talk
[SPEAKER_04]: last year and really talking about seed
quality issues, stand establishment
[SPEAKER_04]: issues, a lot of these seed-related
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my program here at Cornell at the
Geneva Ag Experiment Station, we interact
[SPEAKER_04]: with a lot of different crops,
vegetable crops, but also industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought at the time, I said,
this would be really a good project for my
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory to get involved in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here, less than a year later,
here we are, whereas Chris says we have
[SPEAKER_04]: this Cornell hemp team.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a consortium of faculty with a
wide range of expertise, all kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: focused on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're going to be able to make
quite a bit of progress in a relatively
[SPEAKER_04]: short amount of time as we're working on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, as Chris mentioned, really good
partnership with ag and markets and things
[SPEAKER_04]: like that and being able to kind of work
at the regulatory level with this and
[SPEAKER_04]: getting it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as the research and the outreach
that we're really so good at here at
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: We obviously see, as we're looking at
here, that with seed, obviously the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding and genetics has a key role in
what the plant growth and development is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another key aspect of seed is the seed
quality and really the quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you're buying seed, if you're spending
at least $50 an acre to establish,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a major input into growing really a
field crop like it's an agronomic crop as
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to make sure that you're
really, first of all, getting the good
[SPEAKER_04]: quality seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: As right now for these trials,
we have all the grain types or the
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-purpose types here and there's also
other trials with the fiber types.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 17 seed lots that we're working
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: About half of those are from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest are from Europe, from Eastern
Europe, Poland, Ukraine over to Italy,
[SPEAKER_04]: France are the production, the origin of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking at a pretty good kind of
cross section of commercial seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those seeds have to be imported here
into the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are aspects that really need to
be addressed as far as the quality for
[SPEAKER_04]: that sort of commerce coming into this
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really two aspects of seed
quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always think of, well, the seeds got to
germinate to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another aspect, especially those that
are not involved with agronomic crops or
[SPEAKER_04]: different seeded crops is what we call the
seed purity.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the purity is, is if you're buying a
bag of seed and that could be a bag of
[SPEAKER_04]: wheat, could be a bag of hemp seeds,
is what else is in that bag?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want, for example, down there you want
the hemp to the anchor variety,
[SPEAKER_04]: but what else could be in that bag?
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be weed seeds present.
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be other crop seeds present
and also what we just generically call as
[SPEAKER_04]: centered materials, just other materials,
could be broken seeds, trash materials,
[SPEAKER_04]: stones, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the 17 seed lots that we're working
with now, Michael Luce, who works in my
[SPEAKER_04]: program, he was the former manager of our
New York State Seed Testing Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that seed testing laboratory has now
moved to Albany.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with Michael's actually running the
germinations and the purities on those,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're seeing some of these seed lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I don't have enough data right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: To have as a handout.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of these over 5% inert material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically we say it's pretty trashy
seed that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if somebody's buying this,
you want to make sure that you're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: good quality seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably the two keys that we're
really concerned about in this purity are
[SPEAKER_04]: weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us to import seeds, to receive the
seeds, there has to be an APHIS permit
[SPEAKER_04]: conducted where that what we call a
noxious weed exam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Noxious weeds are seeds which are really
defined by law that are harmful to
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want to have those in the bag
because you're also planting those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also just other common weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like that that may also be present.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going through these samples right
now and just kind of testing, trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: get as much information on the quality
aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the Canadian seed lots that
we've gotten is they're close partners to
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have their seed certification system,
just like Phil has a seed certification
[SPEAKER_04]: program here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The basis of the two programs are the same
as we look at seed certification.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have different levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a certification number one level
and number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do those differ?
[SPEAKER_04]: They really differ based on the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: The level one is the high quality seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the germination needs to be 85% or
higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just two weed seeds can be present and
just one other crop seed in a 25 gram
[SPEAKER_04]: sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are these other crop seeds coming
from you ask?
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have a herbicide that can be
used in the seed production field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there was oats and we've seen oats
as contaminants as other crop seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: sunflower, a lot of those seeds are also
coming over in your seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, we want that to be as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as we've again, let's use that
criteria with the 85% germination and the
[SPEAKER_04]: 70% germination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the 17 seed lots that is being tested
within the Cornell system this year,
[SPEAKER_04]: only five of those had 85% germination and
higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, we really need to have high
quality seeds for that good initial stand
[SPEAKER_04]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine of those, which is about half,
had over 70%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, when this eventually to be a
commercial crop, what you're getting is
[SPEAKER_04]: very important because that really starts
the basis for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of where we're at right now
is in this, I'll say characterization,
[SPEAKER_04]: the quality assurance aspect to make sure
that the farmer ultimately has high
[SPEAKER_04]: quality seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next part is it's already been
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are issues, early germination
events, early seedling emergence,
[SPEAKER_04]: stand establishment issues with the hemp
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I learned from this from my
colleagues in out of state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not a New York problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not unique to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the problems in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have it throughout.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seeds in themselves, I'll just say,
are just have generally a low vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tend to be weak germinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they get going, you can see they grow
like heck.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that early phase, which is a very,
very sensitive phase, and we need to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant establishment again for that
crop to canopy, which is providing the
[SPEAKER_04]: seed management as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything really rotates on getting
off to a good start with the hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, since we're not able to use labeled
of chemical pesticides, including chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: seed treatments, then my laboratory is
interested from the research point of view
[SPEAKER_04]: of looking at some development of some
technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be kind of where we're going
with our research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is as Gary mentioned, a lot of the the
damping off organisms that you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be ubiquitous in our soils here,
pythiums, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of a seed treatment could we
use?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a chemical seed treatment like a
Kaptan or thiram or an apron.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what else could we use that we could
still apply?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're kind of going to our toolbox
where I work with organic vegetable seed
[SPEAKER_04]: productions and that seed production,
but seed quality as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what can we take from that area as
an organic seed treatment?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an area that we're going to be
moving into so we can get some protection
[SPEAKER_04]: from some of these early attacking,
early soil borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second aspect is, again, they are
inherently low vigor seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we don't know enough yet to
really to be able to really define the
[SPEAKER_04]: vigor except doing a germination test.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're relying on people that have
worked in this crop for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that regards, again, kind of some
other work that we're doing is what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: calling biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biostimulants are compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not pesticides that are applied
to plants to enhance plant growth and
[SPEAKER_04]: development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've already done work with seed
treatments with some of these biostimulant
[SPEAKER_04]: type of materials, natural type of
materials, no pesticidal effect on them at
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would they do to a hemp seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, you know, we have a lot to do
ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be ready for next growing season
to actually to test some of these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that kind of gives you in kind of a
quick summary where the seed science and
[SPEAKER_04]: technology program is at the Geneva Ag
experiment station with Cornell focusing
[SPEAKER_04]: right now in the seed testing aspects,
seed quality, just to make sure we can
[SPEAKER_04]: characterize the seed lots that we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the future research and
development really kind of rolling up our
[SPEAKER_04]: sleeves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And developing some very practical seed
treatments that could be used on hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds to enhance plant establishment and
early season growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions along the seed line?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised by the substantial reduction
in germination from that 2017 to 2016
[SPEAKER_12]: lots.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was my understanding was that 2016 lot
was the one that needed to have the
[SPEAKER_12]: seeding rate adjusted.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm wondering if that's somewhat more
unique to hemp maybe because of the high
[SPEAKER_12]: oil content.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because most other crops I'm familiar with
didn't show such a dramatic difference
[SPEAKER_12]: between just one year as long as that seed
was handled reasonably well.
[SPEAKER_04]: A really good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking at the issues of seed
quality, but also in the case if we have
[SPEAKER_04]: carryover seeds, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are kind of as we look kind of cross
the board of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some seeds are just naturally short lived
seed like a soybean happens to be a short
[SPEAKER_04]: lived seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other crops just tend to be like a tomato
seed is a very long lived.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's just sort of like my lifespan
compared to my pet dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog has a shorter natural lifespan
than I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the hemp kind of fits into that as far
as just the genetic basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a high oil content seeds,
but some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not a strict rule of thumb on
oil content.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the tomato seeds,
which is a very long lived seed is a very
[SPEAKER_04]: high oil or lipid content seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of things we really don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from again, kind of what we have seen
is that the storage, especially in a
[SPEAKER_04]: carryover situation can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for example, these companies that
we've talked about up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: the seeds that they're producing last
year, the seeds that we're using,
[SPEAKER_04]: so they are produced, harvested,
they have to be carried over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of these three seed lots of Anka that we
got, all the same variety, three different
[SPEAKER_04]: seed lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from their germination conducted
up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two are in the upper 80s, one is in the
70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, why, you know, in a nice sort
of a way, why did that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these carryover seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, no, they're all harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: One was harvested a little later and may
have had a little bit higher moisture
[SPEAKER_04]: content that went into that over winter
storage, that higher moisture,
[SPEAKER_04]: the seeds are just going to age faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is just, so you can't even say
variety of how things are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: respond.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really have to look at the seed lot
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even like I said, in the example where
we have lots and lots of that seeds for
[SPEAKER_04]: the commercial use this year, there are
differences between those three seed lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, they are attributing it just to
that it's higher moisture content.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can check that moisture content.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, you know, we can look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after the aging has happened and seed
storage, there's nothing, we can't go
[SPEAKER_04]: retro on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least we can characterize that as
knowing what the moisture should be and
[SPEAKER_04]: safe storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Moisture content, is that dictated by when
you harvest?
[SPEAKER_14]: Early harvest, more moisture, late
harvest, less moisture.
[SPEAKER_14]: As an example, is that possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is going on during seed
development and the later phases of seed
[SPEAKER_04]: development is the seed on the mother
plant is drying down.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they would like to do is ideally
harvest at the right moisture content.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that could go right into storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if it is immature seed,
it's going to have a higher moisture or if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's rained or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that seed moisture is just going up and
down with whatever the environment is
[SPEAKER_04]: going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's a high relative humidity,
if there's wetness, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: picking up moisture from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ideal thing is that you want to
harvest at the right moisture content and
[SPEAKER_04]: then go into the storage and things like
that.
Have you determined what that moisture
content is?
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have some things that I've written,
but we've not actually characterized that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to speculate on that right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point because again is
generally when we're in more of the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: where the seed buyer right now,
New York is not a seed producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really are relying on what has happened
upstream with the seed companies,
[SPEAKER_04]: what they've done with seed processing or
what we call seed conditioning,
[SPEAKER_04]: sorting the seeds, doing things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to have one other point on
seed size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, as we're doing this purity,
we look at the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also taking, we have a thousand seed
weight or thousand kernel weight,
[SPEAKER_04]: they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do see varietal differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are just larger seed than others.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even within the sample we have,
there's a large difference in seed size.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's small seeds, medium seeds,
large seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we want uniformity of
germination.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want uniformity of stand establishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not set us on the right foot if
we're already starting off with a wide
[SPEAKER_04]: range of seed sciences within the same
seed lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, something else we need to kind
of look at a little bit there too.
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_16]: So just with your other grain and crops,
you have seed foundation here that checks
[SPEAKER_16]: for quality and de-inerts and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_16]: To me it looks like the hemp is kind of a
rogue introduction to the seed industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would suspect that importing these
seeds from other countries, similar to
[SPEAKER_16]: grain, you're going to have those
imperfections, you're going to have those
[SPEAKER_16]: variations.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm assuming APHIS, Ag and Markets,
seed foundation, they're going to work at
[SPEAKER_16]: developing some basic standards for the
seed or is this just going to be an open
[SPEAKER_16]: forum on whatever comes in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiple points that you're making and all
really good because the bottom line is we
[SPEAKER_04]: want to assure a New York grower that's
going to be planting the hemp that they
[SPEAKER_04]: have good quality seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we look at Canada, Canada
started this in 1998 so they've been
[SPEAKER_04]: doing, they've been growing hemp for many
years and these seed companies I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: are pretty mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not mon pot type of companies that
are just going out here whacking some
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds off and threshing them out and
selling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these are big operations and when
we're buying a 750 kilogram totes of those
[SPEAKER_04]: that are coming in, that's a big seed
production facility that they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not seen it but they're very mature
in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have their own seed
certification standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, to make that number one
certified has to have the high germination
[SPEAKER_04]: of 85 or better, but just a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now if it turns out, let's say just one
other crop seed and then two weed seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: if that sample they pull has four weed
seeds in it, even though the germination
[SPEAKER_04]: is 90%, it drops it down automatically to
their certified level number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grower doesn't really know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just know it's a level two
certification, it's a lower grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know why they have,
but we can track that down and know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think in their system, they're using
both the purity as a criteria for high
[SPEAKER_04]: quality and the germination and it's a
good system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little different than what we do
here in the States, but it is a good
[SPEAKER_04]: system so you know if you're getting that
number one certified that you're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: very good seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the numbers you gave us earlier on the
rates of germination, those were provided
[SPEAKER_13]: by the vendor at their certified levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there's two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I talked about the ANCA,
the three seed lots of ANCA, I don't even
[SPEAKER_04]: have the third seed lot yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's pretty, pretty new and then
it's not only 50 miles from Ithaca to
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva, but it's just cumbersome,
I'll just put it that way, and moving
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds around even within the Cornell
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have not done any of the testing on
these three ANCA lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is we do have samples from
all of these types along with four other
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber types.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is where we did the actual
germination and we're doing the purity
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're that new into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have this field day two weeks from
today in Geneva, I'm going to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: talk more than I can now just because
we're generating the data as we speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ultimately what I want to be able
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, is we're taking out of a little
baggie a sample compared to them going
[SPEAKER_04]: through their large inventory.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to make sure that what we're
saying is representative, not that
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody's right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just being really representative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
Good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you deal with seed death?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if there's patent laws or
things like that surrounding seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: So say somebody took a top headed one-year
plants here and took the seed and
[SPEAKER_15]: replanted it.
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of repercussions would there be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are more the legal aspects and kind
of talked about some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd be dealing with trespass in addition
to the... I'll say multiple issues around
[SPEAKER_13]: doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how is Cornell able to report?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it under the context of research?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie really did a yeoman's job of doing
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you want to talk on acquiring the
seeds for Cornell?
[SPEAKER_30]: I think Chris is going to cover all of the
regulatory stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stay tuned and we'll get that
question answered for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do a moisture test on the incoming
seed from Canada so you know what least
[SPEAKER_04]: level was there?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not gathered that data,
but what we do have are the samples that
[SPEAKER_04]: are still in the original bag so we can go
ahead and sample out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're really concerned about is when
we get a small, when you get a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: gram sample, which is like a cup full of
seeds, and that's in an open porous
[SPEAKER_04]: container and it's a humid day or a dry
day, that's all going to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really need to go back as the best
we can to that and then take a deep core
[SPEAKER_04]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we will have a more representative.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, as you know, as every,
this whole season kind of progressed and
[SPEAKER_04]: getting things, there's a lot of woulda,
coulda, shoulda's and there always isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: doing research, but this was really a
hurry up type of a year to get as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: we are right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think next year will be more in place
with doing those quality right as soon as
[SPEAKER_04]: we receive the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be really good seedsmen here on
our side as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of these plants have a THC and CBDC
profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they been tested yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it available anywhere for us so we
can know what THC quantity or what CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: what types of CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it CBD A, CBD B, just CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have these varieties been tested for that
yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all to be done, correct,
Chris?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear the question?
[SPEAKER_27]: The question was have all the varieties
been tested, sorry, for THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_27]: levels?
[SPEAKER_27]: And the varieties we're growing here will
test here.
[SPEAKER_27]: But in Canada, there's actually a really
informative website, like Ontario Canada
[SPEAKER_27]: fact sheets.
[SPEAKER_27]: And they have fact sheets that cover lots
and lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_27]: And one of the things they have is a list
of varieties and those they found to be
[SPEAKER_27]: low or high THC contents.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I can't remember off the top of my
head if they have CBD in there as well.
[SPEAKER_27]: But that's a very informative site for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there's a lot of unsolved
questions, but we are addressing these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much for your comments
and questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you, Alan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_10]: so our last speaker is Chris Logue,
who I really appreciate came the long
[SPEAKER_10]: distance.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, most of us are right here on
campus or with Alan a little over an hour
[SPEAKER_10]: away.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Chris came quite a distance from
Albany to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris is the Director of the Division of
Plant Industry in the New York State
[SPEAKER_10]: Department of Agriculture and Markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he'll be talking about some of these
regulatory issues like the question that
[SPEAKER_10]: was asked, as well as potential markets
here.
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you very, very much for the
opportunity to be here today.
[SPEAKER_32]: I know I'm going to get lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm glad I don't have notes that I'm
going to follow.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just going to start out a little bit
and tell you sort of how we got here.
[SPEAKER_32]: Gary described himself as a student of
hemp diseases.
[SPEAKER_32]: I have become a student of hemp.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's been the school of hard knocks.
[SPEAKER_32]: There's some people sitting out here that
have been very, very helpful to me in
[SPEAKER_32]: learning about this crop.
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's been a couple of years that we've
been working on hemp.
[SPEAKER_32]: And as all of you know, we started out at
the department with a pretty conservative
[SPEAKER_32]: program that limited our research partners
or limited research permits to folks who
[SPEAKER_32]: were affiliated with colleges and
universities and institutions of higher
[SPEAKER_32]: education.
[SPEAKER_32]: This spring, we were able to open it up
and bring some farmers into it and some
[SPEAKER_32]: other folks.
[SPEAKER_32]: And then, of course, added a number of
research partners with the ANCA trial this
[SPEAKER_32]: summer.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're definitely sort of on the track
towards a more liberal approach to this.
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to talk a little bit about the
authority for any of us to be doing this.
[SPEAKER_32]: So the authority for any of us to be
engaged in this comes from the 2014 Farm
[SPEAKER_32]: Bill.
[SPEAKER_32]: And basically what the 2014 Farm Bill did,
and I'll just paraphrase, basically it
[SPEAKER_32]: enabled universities or institutions of
higher education and state departments of
[SPEAKER_32]: agriculture to engage in industrial hemp
research pilot programs.
[SPEAKER_32]: So on the good side, the Farm Bill doesn't
define what a pilot research program is.
[SPEAKER_32]: And it doesn't necessarily define what
commercialization is.
[SPEAKER_32]: That, in a way, is sort of a double-edged
sword.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not defined.
[SPEAKER_32]: It lets us sort of figure out what the
boundaries are.
[SPEAKER_32]: But I think the other thing that you need
to keep in mind if this is something that
[SPEAKER_32]: you're considering doing, that at some
point along the way, somebody might say,
[SPEAKER_32]: hey, you're up against the fence.
[SPEAKER_32]: You're going too far.
[SPEAKER_32]: And we are dealing quite a bit with
Department of Justice and DEA.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I have to tell you, they've been
extremely helpful to us.
[SPEAKER_32]: I think they've been pretty responsive
with Cornell and SUNY Morrisville.
[SPEAKER_32]: But this is out of the ordinary for them.
[SPEAKER_32]: They regulate controlled substances from
cradle to grave.
[SPEAKER_32]: In the case of hemp, they regulate the
seed, and then they step away from it.
[SPEAKER_32]: So this is new territory for them as well.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other piece that I'll throw out there
is that the Farm Bill will be up for
[SPEAKER_32]: renewal or renegotiation in 2018.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we need to be aware that there
could potentially be some changes in that
[SPEAKER_32]: language in the Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so that's one of the things that's on
my tick list from a policy perspective,
[SPEAKER_32]: working with some of our policy folks in
Albany and in Washington DC to make sure
[SPEAKER_32]: that we can continue to move forward.
[SPEAKER_32]: So going forward with the 2018 Farm Bill,
you could see the same language that was
[SPEAKER_32]: in 2014.
[SPEAKER_32]: You could see a step back away from that
that maybe restricts us more.
[SPEAKER_32]: Or you could see from a federal level
maybe some liberalization.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we need to be aware of that from the
policy perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other thing I'll say on the federal
side is that we had some very high level
[SPEAKER_32]: discussions with some of the federal
folks.
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, they are frankly, they don't
answer a lot of questions directly.
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you start asking me questions about
federal policy, I'm probably going to be a
[SPEAKER_32]: little cagey too.
[SPEAKER_32]: There is also, if you go on our website,
you can check out a number of documents
[SPEAKER_32]: that are very, very important from a
regulatory and an authority perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: The three things that I would say you want
to be looking at and be aware of on the
[SPEAKER_32]: federal level are the wording of the 2014
Farm Bill, the wording in the 2016 Omnibus
[SPEAKER_32]: Budget Act that's very important as well.
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the third piece is a guidance
document from I think July or August of
[SPEAKER_32]: last year that came out from DEA,
FDA, and USDA.
[SPEAKER_32]: So those are sort of the three guiding
documents that are out there.
[SPEAKER_32]: There's still a whole lot of gray in this.
[SPEAKER_32]: What we've tried to do as we've moved
forward with this is to build a program
[SPEAKER_32]: that is, if you will, a safe harbor for
folks who want to get involved in this.
[SPEAKER_32]: We want to try to keep you as farmers,
growers, processors, what have you,
[SPEAKER_32]: sort of in a safe place from the federal
perspective, but at the same time trying
[SPEAKER_32]: to move this ahead and learn as much as we
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_32]: One thing I do want to actually make sure
everybody knows Kate in the back there.
[SPEAKER_32]: Kate is the person who, if you call our
office and you call the hemp 800 number,
[SPEAKER_32]: that was announced a few weeks ago,
you will most likely talk with Kate.
[SPEAKER_32]: And she will, if she can't answer your
question, she's going to take down your
[SPEAKER_32]: information and get the question to
somebody who can help you.
[SPEAKER_32]: So bear with us on that.
[SPEAKER_32]: We're sort of building this as we go.
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to make just a quick comment on the
trial behind me here.
[SPEAKER_32]: This is probably the best hemp I've seen.
[SPEAKER_32]: Not that I've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_32]: But I was in Kentucky a couple of weeks
ago for the hemp regulatory conference and
[SPEAKER_32]: we were on several farms and basically we
were hearing all the same things that all
[SPEAKER_32]: the Cornell faculty have said today.
[SPEAKER_32]: Seed quality, emergence, competition with
weeds, the lack of herbicides if you're in
[SPEAKER_32]: a situation where you would use an
herbicide or another crop protectant on
[SPEAKER_32]: this.
[SPEAKER_32]: We're coming up against all the same
issues that have been identified in other
states.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're learning a lot as we go along.
[SPEAKER_32]: So a little bit about the process going
forward.
[SPEAKER_32]: From an administrative perspective,
I've kind of felt for the last two and a
[SPEAKER_32]: half years like I've been a little bit
behind the curve on the timing on this.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we're always on a scramble to get
things done.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so our goal going forward this year
is, for 2018 I should say, is to try to
[SPEAKER_32]: roll out the application process very,
very soon.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I'm going to throw some dates out
there.
[SPEAKER_32]: Please don't come, call me if this doesn't
come true and give me a hard time.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like it to open up for applications
during the month of August.
[SPEAKER_32]: That's this month.
[SPEAKER_32]: Probably towards the end of the month
because we've got some vacations and some
[SPEAKER_32]: other professional meetings that our staff
are engaged in.
[SPEAKER_32]: And what that means that would do is
basically we'd probably leave that
[SPEAKER_32]: application period open for several
months, maybe into the middle or end of
[SPEAKER_32]: October.
[SPEAKER_32]: That's going to give folks adequate time
to develop their research plan.
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, I keep circling back around to
that farm bill.
[SPEAKER_32]: That allows us to do research,
not commercialization.
[SPEAKER_32]: So the thing that I'm going to weigh most
heavily on an application is what's your
[SPEAKER_32]: research plan?
[SPEAKER_32]: What are you going to be able to bring to
the table to offer as far as new knowledge
[SPEAKER_32]: or knowledge gained?
[SPEAKER_32]: And that, again, we take a very,
very broad approach to research.
[SPEAKER_32]: It can be agronomic.
[SPEAKER_32]: It can be pest management.
[SPEAKER_32]: It can be marketing.
[SPEAKER_32]: It can be product development.
[SPEAKER_32]: You name it, you can probably make the
argument that it's research.
[SPEAKER_32]: So basically getting that out there
August, September, October of this year is
[SPEAKER_32]: going to give you folks time to develop a
good plan.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to give you time to start
talking with your seed suppliers in
[SPEAKER_32]: Canada, the European Union, wherever you
decide you're going to get your seed from.
[SPEAKER_32]: And it also gives us a little bit more
time.
[SPEAKER_32]: We actually applied for our DEA import
permit on March 17th of this year.
[SPEAKER_32]: And the DEA came out I think on June 27th
or something and they interviewed several
[SPEAKER_32]: of us.
[SPEAKER_32]: They took all of our personal information.
[SPEAKER_32]: Names of our eldest children, where they
were located, all that kind of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we're waiting on our permit.
[SPEAKER_32]: So next year, hopefully that permit will
be in place soon.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like it to be in place before we go
out with our application for 2018.
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if that's realistic or not.
[SPEAKER_32]: So once that permit is in place,
that's going to give us the opportunity at
[SPEAKER_32]: the department to play the role of the
importer.
[SPEAKER_32]: So what that means is if you were a
research partner with the department in
[SPEAKER_32]: 2018, you would figure out what seed
variety you wanted or varieties you
[SPEAKER_32]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_32]: You would talk with the seed company,
Canada, the European Union, wherever,
[SPEAKER_32]: and make all the arrangements,
financial, shipping, what have you,
[SPEAKER_32]: to get the seed into the country.
[SPEAKER_32]: And when it's imported, it would be
delivered to Albany.
[SPEAKER_32]: And at that point, you would come to
Albany and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_32]: We would release it to you.
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's kind of what we're looking at
going forward.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're hoping for a much more
streamlined process.
[SPEAKER_32]: Definitely invested in this.
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to be as helpful as we can to
folks.
[SPEAKER_32]: A couple things from the processing
perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: That was the other thing that I was asked
to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_32]: So two things I think I want to sort of
talk a little bit about, sort of what I
[SPEAKER_32]: think of what's going on in the industry.
[SPEAKER_32]: I kind of look at the two major issues
that I think are facing us, almost like a
[SPEAKER_32]: set of bookends.
[SPEAKER_32]: You got the seed issue.
[SPEAKER_32]: And we've talked about a lot of the
physical attributes of the seed as far as
[SPEAKER_32]: seed quality, emergence, all that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_32]: You have the political or the regulatory
aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_32]: Where can you get it?
[SPEAKER_32]: It's hard to get into the country.
[SPEAKER_32]: Need a lot of permits.
[SPEAKER_32]: So if this industry is going to move
forward, I think the plant breeding
[SPEAKER_32]: program and getting domestic seed supply,
and when I say domestic seed supply,
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean the seed supply within the borders
of New York State, where this product is
[SPEAKER_32]: under the state's authority, is really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not a plant breeder, but I do have a
background in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we all have to realize that's not
going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_32]: I've had a bunch of questions here,
and I heard some questions here today
[SPEAKER_32]: about feral stans of hemp.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so that's definitely something that's
sort of on our radar screen.
[SPEAKER_32]: We've got to understand what that is.
[SPEAKER_32]: So that feral hemp that's out there,
that could be something else.
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_32]: Probably hasn't been tested for THC,
number one.
[SPEAKER_32]: Number two, we need to understand what the
genetics of it are.
[SPEAKER_32]: So it could be the foundation for a really
good breeding program or it might be
[SPEAKER_32]: something that we don't want.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so it's going to take some time to
understand what that is.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other bookend that I think is really,
really important is the processing and the
[SPEAKER_32]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's the other thing that is
potentially a little bit risky and where
[SPEAKER_32]: we need to do a lot more work and have a
better understanding of what this plant
[SPEAKER_32]: and what this industry can do.
[SPEAKER_32]: And there's some of you here that have
known me for a while.
[SPEAKER_32]: I was in Extension for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_32]: And actually, this isn't very much
different than any other crop.
[SPEAKER_32]: I talked with a hemp farmer the other day,
and I said, hey, I'm going to tell you the
[SPEAKER_32]: exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_32]: I talked to people 20 years about
strawberries, greenhouse flowers,
[SPEAKER_32]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_32]: We can teach you how to grow this.
[SPEAKER_32]: But we can't necessarily teach you how to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_32]: How to market it, that part of it.
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys have to really sort of take the
ball and run with that to a certain
[SPEAKER_32]: extent.
[SPEAKER_32]: So what we're working on as far as
marketing is concerned is we have in our
[SPEAKER_32]: Division of Ag Development, we have some
staff who do work on marketing efforts.
[SPEAKER_32]: And we're at least taking the step of
moving forward, identifying processors
[SPEAKER_32]: within the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_32]: Because again, relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_32]: If you've got some hemp product and
relative with relative ease, move it about
[SPEAKER_32]: within the borders of the state.
[SPEAKER_32]: We're also identifying processors outside
the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so at least we'll have a resource list
available to you that folks can look at.
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the other thing is, I believe
yesterday or the day before, Empire State
[SPEAKER_32]: Development came out with some processor
grants.
[SPEAKER_32]: So there are some funds available to help
to spur the processing industry.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so if you call us at the department
and talk with the state, I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_32]: you do have a, you've got a contact person
at ESD now.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we have someone we can refer you to.
[SPEAKER_32]: Seed.
[SPEAKER_32]: Certification.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other thing that's on our tick list,
coming out of the bill signing and the
[SPEAKER_32]: summit and really related to my comments
about developing a domestic, within the
[SPEAKER_32]: borders of New York seed industry.
[SPEAKER_32]: One of the things that we really have high
on our list to do is to develop some seed
[SPEAKER_32]: certification standards.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we've got, if you look in the Ag and
Markets Law, there are seed certification
[SPEAKER_32]: standards for all kinds of different crops
that we grow.
[SPEAKER_32]: We work closely with the folks here at New
York State Seed Improvement and Cornell
[SPEAKER_32]: when we develop those standards.
[SPEAKER_32]: But that's going to be very, very
important.
[SPEAKER_32]: And really what it comes down to,
as Dr. Taylor said, in a nutshell is sort
[SPEAKER_32]: of consumer protection for the people who
are buying that seed.
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's really going to set the stage
for developing that industry along with
[SPEAKER_32]: development of some genetics that are good
for New York as well as good for the
[SPEAKER_32]: various uses of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_32]: With that, I can answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sure there will be some.
[SPEAKER_32]: There always are.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_17]: With respect to the 2018 Farm Bill,
what are the political pressure points
[SPEAKER_17]: that can be used to make sure it's
motivated in a favorable direction?
[SPEAKER_32]: So the question was, in regards to the
2018 Farm Bill, what are the pressure
[SPEAKER_32]: points as far as a favorable outcome?
[SPEAKER_32]: I think one of the things with anything at
a federal level, and again, hemp is a very
[SPEAKER_32]: small piece of, well, actually not.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a very large piece of what I've been
doing over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_32]: But we've got a lot of other issues where
we're dealing with the federal government.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would just say in general,
there's a lot of anxiety among sort of
[SPEAKER_32]: middle management folks and federal
agencies.
[SPEAKER_32]: Not necessarily a great deal of direction.
[SPEAKER_32]: I would say one thing that we may have
from a favorable perspective is Kentucky
[SPEAKER_32]: is a big state in hemp.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so you have Mitch McConnell with a
leadership position in Congress.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so that potentially helps with the
whole hemp situation.
[SPEAKER_32]: But I think trying to predict what the
pressure points are is pretty hard with
[SPEAKER_32]: how things have been working at the
federal level at this point.
[SPEAKER_32]: So the question is, is it on the New York
delegation?
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think there's been quite a bit of
interest from the New York delegation,
[SPEAKER_32]: from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: Donna, do you have something you want to
add to that?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: So we were just with Senator Gillibrand
recently.
[SPEAKER_28]: And she is one of the main sponsors of the
2018 Industrial Hemp Farming Act.
[SPEAKER_28]: So our hope is that because of the
interest largely from Kentucky around Paul
[SPEAKER_28]: and Mitch McConnell and others,
and the widespread support in places
[SPEAKER_28]: across the country where it's growing,
that we can get around those pressure
[SPEAKER_28]: points.
[SPEAKER_28]: By just pressuring for full passage of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_28]: We think that is looking much more likely
than it's ever before.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not positive how many of our New York
congressmen have signed on.
[SPEAKER_28]: Last year, I think we had five.
[SPEAKER_28]: And our congressman has recently retired.
[SPEAKER_28]: So he's not on the bill at the moment.
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_28]: The goal is to pass the Industrial Hemp
Farming Act and just make everybody's
[SPEAKER_28]: lives easier.
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question regarding the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know why there's so much effort by
the DEA and play on words when it comes to
[SPEAKER_14]: the CBD extract part of the plant?
[SPEAKER_14]: If they try to make it like it's THC,
we know it's not THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: They play around a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you talking about the rescheduling?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not just the rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yes, rescheduling, but also as part
of the Farm Act.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're trying to delineate the CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't sound favorable right now.
[SPEAKER_32]: So a couple things is there are even some
states, and as I said, I was in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_32]: two weeks ago for the regulatory
conference, which basically was pretty
[SPEAKER_32]: much limited to folks from state
departments of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_32]: There were a few extension people there as
presenters as well.
[SPEAKER_32]: So it was a pretty open, open exchange and
forum.
[SPEAKER_32]: And even some of the states have defined
industrial hemp as grain and fiber only
[SPEAKER_32]: and have limited CBD research.
[SPEAKER_32]: At the federal level, I think there's,
again, a little bit of a disconnect,
[SPEAKER_32]: perhaps, if you will.
[SPEAKER_32]: Because some of those products have not
necessarily had clinical trials on them,
[SPEAKER_32]: and so there's a hesitancy to move forward
with them.
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, I kind of would go back,
and I'm not going to poke another agency.
[SPEAKER_32]: DEA has been pretty helpful to us.
[SPEAKER_32]: DEA has been pretty helpful, I think,
to Cornell and Morrisville.
[SPEAKER_32]: I think, going back to my previous
statement, regulatory officials look for
[SPEAKER_32]: black and white.
[SPEAKER_32]: And there's not a lot of black and white
in this.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so when you have a DEA investigator or
someone in a leadership position at DEA,
[SPEAKER_32]: and it doesn't fit neatly into how they've
defined other substances, they really
[SPEAKER_32]: struggle with that.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I think it's sort of a discovery or
a process of trying to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_32]: what.
[SPEAKER_32]: We've taken a little bit more liberal
approach on the CBD end of things,
[SPEAKER_32]: but we've also had a lot of discussions
with our State Department of Health over
[SPEAKER_32]: the past six months about CBD.
[SPEAKER_32]: And they're in a role where they're going
to be backing us up on a technical
[SPEAKER_32]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: Because as I say to my boss, do you want
an entomologist, a forester, and somebody
[SPEAKER_32]: with a dairy science background to be
evaluating projects that might have
[SPEAKER_32]: medical or health implications?
[SPEAKER_32]: It's out of my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_32]: If you start to talk to me about the
agronomy or the pest management,
[SPEAKER_32]: I can probably look at that pretty easily
and tell if it's a good project,
[SPEAKER_32]: a worthy project.
[SPEAKER_32]: If I have questions, I have probably 11,
right, folks at Cornell who can help me
[SPEAKER_32]: out with that.
[SPEAKER_32]: You start getting into some of the CBD
stuff and start to make health claims and
[SPEAKER_32]: that type of thing, and even to some
extent nutritional claims, we don't
[SPEAKER_32]: necessarily have the best backstop for
that right now.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we're developing that.
[SPEAKER_32]: How about you?
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on that line of what we're just
talking about now, what is New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State's definition then of medical CBD
marijuana versus what I'm looking at right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, which is hemp with CBD oil in it?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a gray area?
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you for saying it's a gray area
because it is a gray area.
[SPEAKER_32]: We're trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, one of the things that's a
little bit of a challenge is, is so within
[SPEAKER_32]: the medical marijuana program,
there are very strict quality control
[SPEAKER_32]: standards in there, very strict production
standards.
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not stuff that we have in the
industrial hemp, current industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_32]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not something that frankly is in the
next iteration of the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_32]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_32]: But we're working on trying to define
where those regulatory boundaries are and
[SPEAKER_32]: when other agencies have to be brought in.
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't want to get in trouble and we
don't want anybody that's sitting here in
[SPEAKER_32]: the audience to get in difficulty with
either another state agency or a federal
[SPEAKER_32]: agency.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I think a little bit of patience,
a little bit of working through it,
[SPEAKER_32]: and we'll certainly get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little experience in hemp and medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a police officer, I might not be
confused by some of these taller
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, but I definitely would be
confused with the smaller varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just based on its look, but based on
its smell, its texture, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially there's that gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Ag and Markets, when people are
applying for these applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping them reach out to their local
police to make sure that they're aware?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have a sign, but my neighbors
would probably read that sign and just
[SPEAKER_00]: report me for growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_32]: So the question was, what about working
with law enforcement as far as on
[SPEAKER_32]: industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I don't have the regulations in
front of me, but basically what we
[SPEAKER_32]: currently have in the regulations and
definitely is going into the next version,
[SPEAKER_32]: is a requirement for when you get your
industrial hemp research authorization
[SPEAKER_32]: from the department, you have a certain
amount of time to reach out to your local
[SPEAKER_32]: law enforcement agency and let them know
that you have this permit, okay?
[SPEAKER_32]: And so each of the original 10
authorization holders have done that,
[SPEAKER_32]: and they report back to us that they've
completed it.
[SPEAKER_32]: Oftentimes they send us a copy of the
letter or give a reference to a phone call
[SPEAKER_32]: or what have you that happened.
[SPEAKER_32]: And interestingly enough, we've gotten
questions on it.
[SPEAKER_32]: We had somebody actually call in,
and it came, I don't think it came to my
[SPEAKER_32]: desk, I think it came to Tim's desk,
and came to his desk as, you have an
[SPEAKER_32]: industrial hemp call.
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, it was a county sheriff,
and a fisherman had scampered up from the
[SPEAKER_32]: riverbank and apparently had walked some
distance from where he started fishing,
[SPEAKER_32]: and he came up in something that looked
like this, and he called the police.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so that particular authorization
holder had talked with somebody within the
[SPEAKER_32]: county sheriff's department, but some of
the word hadn't gone through the whole
[SPEAKER_32]: organization, so we were able to take that
call and answer it.
[SPEAKER_32]: We also have had calls from New York State
Police Intelligence Unit, because some of
[SPEAKER_32]: our authorization holders have sent the
license in.
[SPEAKER_32]: The license looks like our plant life,
plant industry, plant dealer, or plant
[SPEAKER_32]: grower license.
[SPEAKER_32]: And when you photocopy it, the security
paper, the watermark doesn't show up,
[SPEAKER_32]: and so they rightfully questioned whether
it was the real deal or not.
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you want to add something,
Donna?
[SPEAKER_28]: Two things, just for reference.
[SPEAKER_28]: Binghamton University has 15,000 CBD-rich
plants in the ground in a raised bed
[SPEAKER_28]: format.
[SPEAKER_28]: They're doing a different type of grow.
[SPEAKER_28]: Their plants were imported as cuttings
from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_28]: That is IP-protected material that's been
cut and cloned.
[SPEAKER_28]: And the local sheriff was very interested
to come and see what was going on,
[SPEAKER_28]: but we've had across the board support
from law enforcement, largely because when
[SPEAKER_28]: they understand the issue of
cross-pollination, this does have an
[SPEAKER_28]: impact on illegally grown marijuana,
which makes them very happy.
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of us not so much, but some people
are not happy about it.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_32]: And since Donna brought up Kentucky,
I guess I should address that issue.
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you look at the US Department of
Justice guidance and you look at the
[SPEAKER_32]: three-agency guidance document from a year
ago, it expressly forbids the movement of
[SPEAKER_32]: plants and seeds among states.
[SPEAKER_32]: However, there's another document that
says industrial hemp can move among states
[SPEAKER_32]: that have programs, state-authorized
programs.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so the guidance document doesn't
necessarily have force of law behind it.
[SPEAKER_32]: I will tell you that the DEA is fully
aware that plants and seeds are coming
[SPEAKER_32]: from Kentucky and Colorado and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_32]: The department's not going to facilitate
that.
[SPEAKER_32]: But we are not at this point going to
forbid you from doing that.
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that will probably continue to be
a question that we wrestle with a little
[SPEAKER_32]: bit.
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, some of the other states that we
interfaced with down in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_32]: basically we're saying, well, once you do
that, you don't kind of know what you're
[SPEAKER_32]: getting into your state.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so potentially you have some issues
going forward from a regulatory
[SPEAKER_32]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you do that, you're doing it at your
own risk.
[SPEAKER_32]: And anybody who's a current authorization
holder has read all of the releases and
[SPEAKER_32]: signed the forms.
[SPEAKER_32]: Anybody that applies, you'll see the
paperwork that's involved in this.
[SPEAKER_32]: Sir.
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my wife's Canadian relatives
involved in the hemp industry up there.
[SPEAKER_18]: He said a nightly occurrence, car pulls
up, jumps the fence, whack a few bushes
[SPEAKER_18]: back in the car, and away they go.
[SPEAKER_18]: As a grower or possessor of hemp in New
York through this program, what are my
[SPEAKER_18]: legal responsibilities should that happen
on my farm?
[SPEAKER_18]: Go back to bed, call the cops?
[SPEAKER_18]: This is getting out into the community,
even whatever is in it.
[SPEAKER_32]: So first off, I'm not an attorney.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm a plant industry director.
[SPEAKER_32]: But what I would say is if I held a
research authorization and that was
[SPEAKER_32]: happening, I would first, per our
regulation, you've already got a
[SPEAKER_32]: relationship with your local law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_32]: That's part of the reason we want you to
call if you have our research
[SPEAKER_32]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_32]: That's part of the reason we want you to
call local law enforcement so they know
[SPEAKER_32]: it's there, so they maybe can drive by a
little more often if they want to keep an
[SPEAKER_32]: eye on what's going on, but also so you
have a relationship.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would say you want to call them and
report it.
[SPEAKER_32]: And the other piece of it is this is for
whoever's taking it.
[SPEAKER_32]: They have no legal protection.
[SPEAKER_32]: Once they cross the fence, OK,
if I cut one of these now and I went
[SPEAKER_32]: outside across that fence, I have a
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so any law enforcement officer,
because I'm not a research authorization
[SPEAKER_32]: holder in the program, would have every
right to stop me.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would say you report it and document
that as well.
[SPEAKER_32]: Because one of the things that potentially
happens going forward is you potentially
[SPEAKER_32]: get into a situation where your neighbor
maybe doesn't like this form of
[SPEAKER_32]: agriculture and decides they want to
challenge you on that.
[SPEAKER_32]: So you want to have a good record that you
have been diligent about controlling this
[SPEAKER_32]: product and keeping it from getting where
it shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of a compound question for you here,
Chris, flowing from this one.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you establish the chain of title or
provenance of the product that you have if
[SPEAKER_13]: you do acquire it by appropriate means and
you're a processor, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you need to have a certification or the
bill of sale?
[SPEAKER_13]: What documentation will essentially
qualify you to hold that product?
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you had mentioned earlier that
it's fairly easy to move this product
[SPEAKER_13]: around within the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_13]: That suggests to me that it might be a
little bit, but you also did say
[SPEAKER_13]: identifying processors out of state.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm curious, is it something where the
raw product, the raw seed, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_13]: is more difficult to send out of state?
[SPEAKER_13]: Once it's processed into a product,
is that relatively easier to send out?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_32]: So a couple things.
[SPEAKER_32]: So number one, your first question was
sort of how do you establish the chain of
[SPEAKER_32]: title, correct?
[SPEAKER_32]: And so what we've done up to now is that
we have had our authorization holders,
[SPEAKER_32]: if they're sending a product to
processing, we've added that processor as
[SPEAKER_32]: a site under their existing license.
[SPEAKER_32]: I think what we're going to do going
forward is to actually register
[SPEAKER_32]: processors.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we don't envision the registration
of processors to have a fee attached to it
[SPEAKER_32]: at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's basically you're filing with us to
say you are a hemp processor.
[SPEAKER_32]: That way, if you are in possession and
really what concerns us is if you were a
[SPEAKER_32]: processor and you were in possession of
any propagative material, so in other
[SPEAKER_32]: words, seed that hasn't been roasted or
denatured or sterilized, we want to have
[SPEAKER_32]: you as a processor have a piece of paper
in your hand that says you're authorized
[SPEAKER_32]: to have that in the event that federal
officials came in and asked why you had
[SPEAKER_32]: that product.
[SPEAKER_32]: The second part of your question?
[SPEAKER_13]: It was again about the ease of
transporting products across state lines.
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you go back, and again I don't have
the exact wording in my mind, but if you
[SPEAKER_32]: go back to the Controlled Substances Act
of 1970, it actually exempts certain parts
[SPEAKER_32]: of the plant, even right within the
Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_32]: Now one of the things I will say,
and again I'm not in the business of
[SPEAKER_32]: poking another agency, especially the DEA,
since I need to get a permit from them
[SPEAKER_32]: right now, if you interpret the Controlled
Substances Act literally, you could make
[SPEAKER_32]: the interpretation that hemp was never
illegal.
[SPEAKER_32]: It was just really hard to get the permits
for it.
[SPEAKER_32]: In fact, nobody ever got the permits for
it over the past 50 years.
[SPEAKER_32]: So seed and plants, probably pretty
difficult to get from state to state.
[SPEAKER_32]: That's going to pique the interest of the
DEA.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I will tell you in our interviews,
they're well aware of what's going on and
[SPEAKER_32]: have what I would say is pretty good
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other parts of the plant should move
very easily among states that have an
[SPEAKER_32]: industrial hemp program.
[SPEAKER_32]: North Dakota, I believe, last year ran
into some problems where one of their
[SPEAKER_32]: authorization holders had a large amount
of material, and I can't remember what
[SPEAKER_32]: part of the plant it was, that DEA held
for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_32]: And the Department of Agriculture and the
DEA got into a war of letters and
[SPEAKER_32]: eventually the product was released and
went to where it needed to go.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think we're going to run into some
bumps like that from time to time.
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, what happened last year,
which I believe was either in December or
[SPEAKER_32]: January in talking sort of informally with
my counterpart in North Dakota,
[SPEAKER_32]: his take on it was there was an
administration change going on.
[SPEAKER_32]: There was a lack of clarity as to where
this was going and that somebody at a
[SPEAKER_32]: regional level had decided to take
advantage of that change and try to make
[SPEAKER_32]: an example, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think as we move through the 2018
Farm Bill process, we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_32]: much better sense of what the federal
administration is thinking and where we're
[SPEAKER_32]: going on this.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, ma'am?
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you're planting hemp on forested
land, I've had theft on forested property
[SPEAKER_24]: and this was handled by the, I guess,
the Forest Department of the State Police.
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you're planting hemp on a property
that's forested, well, let's say part of
[SPEAKER_24]: it is forested and you're planting it on
who do you go to if you have a pig?
[SPEAKER_32]: I think if you have a theft issue and
you're holding our, you know, if you're
[SPEAKER_32]: holding our ag and markets research
authorization, you would go to your local
[SPEAKER_32]: law enforcement officials, but you would
also want to be sure that we at the
[SPEAKER_32]: department knew what was going on as well.
[SPEAKER_24]: And do you get signage to put on the
property?
[SPEAKER_32]: So the current regulation, and again,
the current regulation that's on the
[SPEAKER_32]: books, we wrote those with the research
institutions in mind.
[SPEAKER_32]: So frankly, they're a little bit outdated
for where we are.
[SPEAKER_32]: Right now, as far as what's going on in
the state, those original regulations did
[SPEAKER_32]: have a specific signage requirement.
[SPEAKER_32]: And going forward, that's not going to be
in the next iteration of the regulations
[SPEAKER_32]: because you sort of have a double edged
sword with signage.
[SPEAKER_32]: It can, if you put a no trespassing sign
here, I'm not going to go in, but if my
[SPEAKER_32]: wife saw a no trespassing sign here,
she would go in because she'd want to see
[SPEAKER_32]: what was in there.
[SPEAKER_32]: We tested that years ago at the Washington
state governor's mansion and the troopers
[SPEAKER_32]: took us out of there.
[SPEAKER_32]: So you know, we got like three steps up
the driveway.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not like in Albany where there's a
gate.
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, so you know, signage is really
going to depend upon your your situation.
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, driving up and looking at this
from the road, I could tell it was hemp
[SPEAKER_32]: from the road, but I was looking for hemp
if I was driving by here and had no idea
[SPEAKER_32]: that it was here, I would just think it
was some different field crop.
[SPEAKER_32]: So a lot's going to depend upon upon your
location.
[SPEAKER_32]: The signage to a certain extent,
you know, one of our authorization holders
[SPEAKER_32]: said, Hey, we're putting an advertisement
on this.
[SPEAKER_32]: And he wasn't concerned about the local
kids going in the field and stealing it.
[SPEAKER_32]: He was concerned about, you know,
somebody else within a five mile radius
[SPEAKER_32]: that was perhaps growing something else
and didn't want the pollen from his crop
[SPEAKER_32]: to contaminate and elicit grow and having
it be destroyed because of that.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_29]: Is there any answer as to whether a farmer
who's holding a federal program benefit
[SPEAKER_29]: like through FSA can grow under the New
York permit?
[SPEAKER_32]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_32]: So the question was, can somebody who is
participating in some of the federal some
[SPEAKER_32]: of the other federal programs like
Conservation Reserve or what have you,
[SPEAKER_32]: can they hold our permit and participate
without putting into jeopardy their other
[SPEAKER_32]: payments?
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we've been going back and forth
quite a bit with our legal counsel on
[SPEAKER_32]: that.
[SPEAKER_32]: And we don't necessarily have a have a
clear answer on that.
[SPEAKER_32]: Our legal counsel at the department feels
as though with our research authorization,
[SPEAKER_32]: there shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_32]: But that is not to say that somebody at
the county level and an FSA or another
[SPEAKER_32]: federal office couldn't hold something up.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think that's something we're still
working on and trying to hammer that out.
[SPEAKER_32]: And perhaps, you know, perhaps that's
something from a policy perspective that
[SPEAKER_32]: needs to be defined better in the farm
bill.
[SPEAKER_32]: I do think the bill that was signed here
back a few weeks ago that the state level
[SPEAKER_32]: reiterates the fact that this is an
agricultural commodity.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that may help a little bit
with this.
[SPEAKER_32]: But we're sort of on untested waters on
that.
[SPEAKER_32]: But it's a great question and one that
we've heard a number of times and are
[SPEAKER_32]: working on.
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mentioned we've got 31 states now who
are involved in research and production of
[SPEAKER_16]: some sort.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any group lobbying effort?
[SPEAKER_16]: Going on a federal level to look at
legislation for the 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, our current attorney general is
probably not hemp friendly.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you mentioned one other workshop
that he spells everything POT.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I mean, moving forward, I mean,
as these states develop this federal
[SPEAKER_16]: regulation, I thought that was going to be
one of the bookends you were talking
[SPEAKER_16]: about.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I mean, that one is that one is for
sure is is also in there.
[SPEAKER_32]: So, you know, I've been asked actually was
asked yesterday to be sure to write up,
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, my policy issues within plant
industry for the 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, was encouraged to have
several that related to industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think we'll come at it from that
direction.
[SPEAKER_32]: I also think that the National Association
of State Departments of Agriculture will
[SPEAKER_32]: will likely and that's basically the
commissioners and the state directors and
[SPEAKER_32]: those types of folks at the highest levels
will probably have something from a policy
[SPEAKER_32]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: And then, you know, there's the hemp
Industries Association and some of the
[SPEAKER_32]: other like vote hemp, who I think will
have some some pressure from, you know,
[SPEAKER_32]: the produce are in the general public side
and Farm Bureau probably will as well.
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that in their policy manual at this
policy book?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, got that time limit put in
there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lobby in Albany and in Washington and I
make sure that I go because some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other people still don't understand the
difference between marijuana and happen
[SPEAKER_00]: still legislators like when you said
they're about five when Donna was saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that like there really weren't when I
brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were not in the last three years
understanding it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they're like, oh, yeah,
I've heard about this and then we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to contact your county
Farm Bureau and help support them and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them know that people are farmers are
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't know farmers are interested
in it, they're not going to want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we Farm Bureau supports what
farmers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not feeling a need from
farmers, then they're not going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I'm just the crazy hemp
lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had a question a lot about seed
protection and cloning protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about it's a perennial plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we protecting it from growing
back perennially?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if a farmer cuts it down,
say with a sift and leaves the roots in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground, there's a good chance it's
going to come back on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they let it go to seed and they
don't collect all those seeds before they
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the ground, there's a good chance it's
just going to seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we talking about protection on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like with apples or other farm bodies,
is there like a statute of limitations
[SPEAKER_00]: like an apple that is crossbred?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a new Snapdragon 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can plant it, but I can't sell it for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will be able to sell it as
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there things like that for this
perennial growth?
[SPEAKER_32]: So I don't think we've really addressed
that at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_32]: And perhaps that's something, you know,
I know that's an issue because what I've
[SPEAKER_32]: learned is when it goes through the
combine, it does shatter.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so you do have a lot of reseeding
during just during the harvesting process.
[SPEAKER_32]: So that is probably something that we've
got to address at some point.
[SPEAKER_32]: Going forward.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any interest in developing a
market for the herd and putting that back
[SPEAKER_06]: in the ground and getting carbon credits?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a lot of activity in India
and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole market.
[SPEAKER_32]: So we actually have an authorization
holder or current authorization holder
[SPEAKER_32]: that has a piece of that in their research
plan to be looking at that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think I think Dr. Vyans was talking
a little bit about the systematics person
[SPEAKER_32]: looking at how it fits into a rotation.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so there may be some really good
agronomic and carbon credit issues that
[SPEAKER_32]: are benefits in a rotation, even if you
weren't going to the extent of growing it
[SPEAKER_32]: for grain or some other purpose.
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there going to be a cap on how many
research license holders are going to be
[SPEAKER_26]: available for next year?
[SPEAKER_32]: So the cap was removed from the law.
[SPEAKER_32]: So what I would say to you is we're still
going to require an application.
[SPEAKER_32]: We're still going to require the
application fee.
[SPEAKER_32]: It's $500 for three years.
[SPEAKER_32]: And we're still going to, as long as the
farm bill is in place and says it's a
[SPEAKER_32]: research pilot program, we're still going
to be evaluating proposals and making sure
[SPEAKER_32]: that the projects that we give the
authorizations to have a research outcome
[SPEAKER_32]: associated with them.
[SPEAKER_32]: But we don't anticipate a limited number.
[SPEAKER_32]: Now the other piece of it, I also need to
be protective of the fact that there are
[SPEAKER_32]: many important missions that my division
is responsible for in New York State.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I have a limited number of people out
there to do this work.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we have export certification and
interstate certification of many
[SPEAKER_32]: agricultural products that are very
lucrative for the state of New York for
[SPEAKER_32]: our farmers.
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to make sure we fulfill that.
[SPEAKER_32]: We have plant pest and survey
responsibilities for invasive insects and
[SPEAKER_32]: diseases that would cause damage to the
agriculture of New York as well as the
[SPEAKER_32]: environment.
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to take that very, very seriously.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I guess where I'm going is if I got
10,000 applications, I probably can't give
[SPEAKER_32]: out 10,000 authorizations.
[SPEAKER_32]: But what we're hoping to do is create an
environment where we're learning as much
[SPEAKER_32]: as we can going forward for the time when
maybe the Industrial Hemp Farming Act
[SPEAKER_32]: sails through.
[SPEAKER_32]: And if it's no longer a regulated
substance, then our role is diminished a
[SPEAKER_32]: great deal, I would say, from a regulatory
perspective.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other part that I'll just throw out
there is I think anybody who's involved in
[SPEAKER_32]: this, for the time being, with it being
federally regulated as well as regulated
[SPEAKER_32]: at the state level, you have to understand
what it is that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_32]: You need to know your seed source.
[SPEAKER_32]: You need to know that it does meet the
0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_32]: And you need to do everything in your
power to protect yourself as well as
[SPEAKER_32]: protect all the great work that's been
done to bring this from something that
[SPEAKER_32]: everybody was scared to death of.
[SPEAKER_32]: Two years ago to something where there's
50 or 100 people under a tent at Ithaca
[SPEAKER_32]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_32]: So Donnie, you want to make a comment on
that?
[SPEAKER_28]: I know we're running long, but I just want
to make a couple of quick summary
[SPEAKER_28]: comments.
[SPEAKER_28]: First, I want to thank Cornell for putting
this together.
[SPEAKER_28]: This is really informative.
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted you to know that she feels
really good about being in New York State
[SPEAKER_28]: right now around this.
[SPEAKER_28]: Compared to other states who may be
permitting this, all of the gears are in
[SPEAKER_28]: motion.
[SPEAKER_28]: As hard as it is to believe.
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to pinch myself.
[SPEAKER_28]: The governor just put $10 million down on
the table for processor grants of
[SPEAKER_28]: $250,000.
[SPEAKER_28]: And we have a one-stop shop and a helpline
and many, many folks, good folks like
[SPEAKER_28]: Chris Looge and others in ag and markets
who are very committed to this.
[SPEAKER_28]: What I'm hoping to see happen,
that's what I wanted to leave you with,
[SPEAKER_28]: and from my end, is we're hoping that hubs
will be developing.
[SPEAKER_28]: We're seeing a food and beverage hub
starting to develop in central New York.
[SPEAKER_28]: We're seeing a CBD pharmaceutical hub
starting to develop in the southern tier.
[SPEAKER_28]: Hudson Valley is also doing some food and
beverage and some other, and some CBD,
[SPEAKER_28]: but it would be helpful if the farm bureau
and farm collectives could get more
[SPEAKER_28]: organized so that we're not sort of
tripping over each other.
[SPEAKER_28]: That you've got 10 farms all growing the
same thing with a partner processor with a
[SPEAKER_28]: market in mind.
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're not sort of in the wild west
here.
[SPEAKER_28]: The governor has directed all of Empire
State Development and all the regional
[SPEAKER_28]: economic development councils to
prioritize this.
[SPEAKER_28]: So in central New York, Finger Lakes,
and southern tier, where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_28]: money from the Upstate Revitalization
Initiative, they're looking for projects.
[SPEAKER_28]: And they want to be able to provide some
funding to help this.
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're lucky in this regard.
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you everybody for going along with
this crazy day.
[SPEAKER_28]: Chris, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you make a list of the farmers
available to people who want to process so
[SPEAKER_32]: that we know where to go get material?
[SPEAKER_32]: So we have not done that at this point in
time.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we're working through some some
foil issues on that and just trying to
[SPEAKER_32]: understand exactly what we can and can't
release.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we probably will have the answers
to those questions in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_32]: weeks because we've been asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, I mean, if processors are
really interested, Extension puts out
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletters to all farmers, put in ad
newsletters that you're looking for feed
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're looking for fiber, what you're
looking for, and they'll come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then no foil needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you were to get a farmer to give you
seed, it has to be sterilized at the
[SPEAKER_11]: farmer level or are you allowed to
sterilize?
[SPEAKER_32]: So as a processor, you could sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_32]: But the other thing is, is that from what
I've been told by some of the
[SPEAKER_32]: authorization holders is one of the things
that they want is to be able to use the
[SPEAKER_32]: unsterilized seed and some and some
products and that there are some
[SPEAKER_32]: attributes of the seed, you know,
before it's roasted or before it's
[SPEAKER_32]: denatured in some other way that are
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so what I would say as long as it's
not moving beyond the borders of the state
[SPEAKER_32]: where we can't really have any real impact
on, you know, changing that policy today,
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, work with us to figure out how
to get it to where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's clarify while we navigate the gray
area.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you get an application to grow for CBD
only in New York State right now?
[SPEAKER_32]: Submit one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as the processors go,
are extractions part of that dialogue?
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_32]: So what's going to happen on CBD?
[SPEAKER_32]: A little bit more detail on that.
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess I glossed over it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_32]: So a little bit more detail on that is
that the Department of Health has asked us
[SPEAKER_32]: to put several CBD-related questions on
the application so that we can flag
[SPEAKER_32]: projects that need to have somebody with a
health, nutritional, or medical background
[SPEAKER_32]: help us to review.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so those are probably going to go into
a separate pile and we will have a group
[SPEAKER_32]: of folks from our department as well as
from Department of Health who will be
[SPEAKER_32]: looking at those.
[SPEAKER_32]: And trying to navigate those through the
system and understand exactly what it is
[SPEAKER_32]: that you're wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_32]: And what we're contemplating, and again,
this is early on and it's an important
[SPEAKER_32]: detail that you ask about, we'll probably,
we have what's called a research partner
[SPEAKER_32]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_32]: So the way the process works right now is
you submit an application.
[SPEAKER_32]: We act upon it.
[SPEAKER_32]: We say we like your project.
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the next step is we send you our
research partner agreement, which is
[SPEAKER_32]: basically outlining what your
responsibilities as our research partner
[SPEAKER_32]: with the State Department of Agriculture,
what your responsibilities are,
[SPEAKER_32]: what our responsibilities are.
[SPEAKER_32]: And so in that agreement, on the CBD end
of things, there probably will be some
[SPEAKER_32]: specific clauses that are inserted in
there that are, again, trying to build you
[SPEAKER_32]: a safe harbor within what we currently
know about CBD.
[SPEAKER_32]: And every state is struggling with the CBD
thing because there's a lack of clarity.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you one more thing that out in
Oregon we struggle with.
[SPEAKER_14]: In Oregon we had a thousand acres planted
last year and they had three thousand
[SPEAKER_14]: acres planted this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Much of it is for CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is not enough infrastructure to do
anything with this material.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're so limited on extracting
facilities, food grain approved
[SPEAKER_14]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_14]: You get all this flour and it's going out
of state to get extracted because it has
[SPEAKER_14]: to.
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, and there's definitely some
challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_32]: We were in a processing plant in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_32]: One part of it was for food grade work.
[SPEAKER_32]: The other part was fiber and structural
materials.
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think they said that's one of the
biggest plants in the country and it
[SPEAKER_32]: wasn't very big.
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's, as I said, the bookends,
the seed, and the processing.
[SPEAKER_32]: The processing piece is vitally important
going forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave?
[SPEAKER_05]: Several people have mentioned grower
co-ops and collectives and things like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cornell does have a resource in Bobby
Severson in the Dyson School that provides
[SPEAKER_05]: guidance in terms of co-op formation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is that resource if you would
like to pursue it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_27]: So Chris, maybe we should wrap up and let
folks talk to everyone individually and
[SPEAKER_27]: walk around the plaza a bit.
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to get some water.
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
