[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Nina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining me today for the
seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to give you a little overview of what
we're going to be talking about today,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk a little bit about,
just very briefly, research in botanic
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens in general, getting the master's
in public garden leadership.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to kind of give a perspective on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to jump into some
research I helped out with at the Morton
[SPEAKER_02]: Arboretum in Chicago last summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to finish up by talking
about some of the research I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with while here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in botanic gardens, there's been a
history of research that's dated back
[SPEAKER_02]: about 500 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the earliest iterations of what we'd
actually consider a botanic garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a research focus at these
institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first kind of botanic gardens that we
really considered seeing in the world were
[SPEAKER_02]: what was known as the physics gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these were gardens that were
associated with universities and primarily
[SPEAKER_02]: were focused on teaching students about
medicinal plants and for doctors who were
[SPEAKER_02]: studying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first gardens to be established
were in Italy at the University of Pisa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even from back in this date,
we see that research has been an important
[SPEAKER_02]: part of what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stepping into the more modern day,
some of the research that we see that has
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of traditionally happened at botanic
gardens has really been work mostly around
[SPEAKER_02]: systematics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at phylogenetic relationships
of plants and classification, particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: with plant exploration and the work that
was going on of bringing plants from other
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the world and classifying them,
as well as floristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floristics being looking at plants from
the perspective of biogeography and the
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution of the different species and
what affects speciation in this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this work has, of course, been
supported by herbarium work, the drying of
[SPEAKER_02]: physical plants to do this kind of
taxonomic description, but then also
[SPEAKER_02]: increasingly with living collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bringing seed back or living plants and
growing them on in collections and using
[SPEAKER_02]: them for this type of study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more modern focuses that we're
starting to see, more gardens put an
[SPEAKER_02]: emphasis on is definitely conservation
biology and the disciplines that go on
[SPEAKER_02]: within that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicago Botanic Garden and Missouri
Botanic Garden being two examples of
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens that have a strong focus on
planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, horticultural research has
also been an important topic that botanic
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens have played a very active role in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned, particularly with plant
exploration, going to new parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, bringing plants back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with that, subsequent plant
introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we grow these plants on in our
living collections, we also give us an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity for plant evaluation,
such as disease screening or pest
[SPEAKER_02]: screening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in many ways tied into plant
breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, gardens have started to become
more of just a nice place to go visit and
[SPEAKER_02]: see plants from around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're starting more and more to
consider them as what we would consider a
[SPEAKER_02]: germplasm repository, where these wild
collected plants are representations of
[SPEAKER_02]: their wild populations, which can then be
used for study, conservation, or plant
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a very brief overview of
research in botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'm going to transition in
to talk a little bit about the work I did
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Morton Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_02]: For people who aren't familiar with the
public garden leadership program,
[SPEAKER_02]: between your first and the second year,
all the fellows in the program go to
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in the United States and
participate in an internship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found myself at the Morton Arboretum for
a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got an excellent plant collection
that I was very interested in interacting
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Morton Arboretum, to give a
general overview, is 1,700 acres,
[SPEAKER_02]: so quite a large garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's more than just the arboretum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They focus on more than plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have natural areas, as well as
prairies, a number of formal gardens,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, such as a children's garden,
which is a great way to diversify your
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens to get different types of
audiences to come and visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have some other specialized
gardens, like a hedge garden and fragrance
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a $27 million annual budget,
employ over 350 employees, including
[SPEAKER_02]: part-time and seasonals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this garden was established in 1922 by
Joy Morton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people will typically know the Morton
name as the salt empire and people in that
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the Morton Arboretum, they've got
many thousands living plants, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: have 4,100 different specific taxa,
so different species or subspecies growing
[SPEAKER_02]: on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Morton Arboretum was an
interesting place to go because of their
[SPEAKER_02]: living collections and because it is such
a widely visited garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also have a very well-developed
research program at the Morton Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they focus on a broad number of
disciplines, from plant systematics,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of our more traditional research that
we'd find in gardens, to forest ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Robert Fahey, Bob Fahey,
who's the son of Tim Fahey, who some folks
[SPEAKER_02]: might be familiar with in natural
resources works there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also focus on plant conservation,
arbora culture, root biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lab I was most interested in
working with was the Urban Soils Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Bryant Schoenbrock heads up the
Mass Soil Science Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what makes their lab a little bit
interesting is that they have a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different areas of research interest,
but they really focus on urban soils and
[SPEAKER_02]: urban ecosystems as their central focus,
such as in urban ecology and biochemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: and assessment and remediation of urban
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also do some focus on forest
management as well as prairie studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these two kind of last two areas,
the prairie ecology and forest management,
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually a lot of the research that
gets done physically on the grounds of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Morton Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of something that makes
them a little different as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that they use their landscape and view
their landscape as a living laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to give a kind of overview of what
Bryant's lab looks like, because it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little different than what we tend to see
in the academic setting, is that Bryant
[SPEAKER_02]: has been there for five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's published 12 publications and done 53
presentations at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the major differences is that
there's only two employees in the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: his lab manager and himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he works with graduate students,
but not specifically as chairs for
[SPEAKER_02]: committees, more kind of tangentially,
like the way he's worked with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he does sit on some committees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where he kind of makes up the
difference in productivity that graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: students will bring to a lab is in his use
of volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in five years, he's ended up having
over 150 volunteers in his lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as 41 interns.
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears that some of these volunteers
are quite ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and he'll enlist anyone that he can,
including his children, to do lab work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that volunteers are
something that Botanic Gardens heavily use
[SPEAKER_02]: to help fulfill their work and their
missions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just one example, because it's
an interesting one, of how his lab can
[SPEAKER_02]: still be very productive, but in a
slightly different context than what we
[SPEAKER_02]: may be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So jumping into urban science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urban soils, which is going to be what we
talk about for the remainder of this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read this definition,
because I think it really sums up what
[SPEAKER_02]: urban soils are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urban soils are non-agricultural,
man-made surface layer, more than 50
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeters thick, that have been produced
by a mixing, filling, or contamination of
[SPEAKER_02]: land in urban or suburban areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what we're talking about here is
we're talking about soils that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural, aren't found in a natural
ecosystem, and typically in one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: another are adversely, or are impacted by
human use or human presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is this an important area of
study?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important in area of study,
particularly in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: because in the next 40 years, we're
projected to have 5% more urban areas in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And humans have unique impacts that alter
the soil's biogeochemical processes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and really make them a distinct and unique
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in surveys of urban soils that have
been done, we tend to see a suite of
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics that we will find,
such as high bulk densities, decreases in
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter, poor structure,
high pH, low water holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_02]: decrease in aggregate stability,
inadequate soil depth for root growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a decrease in microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was at the Morton Arboretum,
I specifically helped out with the Chicago
[SPEAKER_02]: Urban Forestry Study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Chicago Urban Forestry Study was a
joint study between the Morton Arboretum
[SPEAKER_02]: and the US Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's two main PIs on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Bryant Sharon Brock in the Urban
Soil Science Lab, as well as Bob Fahey in
[SPEAKER_02]: Forest Ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm primarily going to be talking about
this first area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second area, Robert Fahey was mostly
using dendrochronology techniques to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at how the urban forest was responding to
different differences in different
[SPEAKER_02]: climatic events, so particularly drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to see how the forest was
responding to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the justification for the study is
that there had been no comprehensive study
[SPEAKER_02]: of carbon storage that had been conducted
in an urban system based on different land
[SPEAKER_02]: use types, and then looking at the soils
both in a shallow, 20 centimeters,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as deep, up to a meter in depth,
and in some places deeper than that even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is important because in the urban
environment, soils themselves make up the
[SPEAKER_02]: single largest terrestrial sink of carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: With up to 64% followed by vegetation,
which are two factors that we considered
[SPEAKER_02]: in this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at about 84% of all the carbon
that cycles in the urban system.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a study that was conducted in 2000 by
Joe Gaby and Jackson, they looked at three
[SPEAKER_02]: different natural land ecosystems,
land types, and looked at how carbon was
[SPEAKER_02]: distributed within the top centimeter of
soil based on these three land types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found from this initial
study was that in shrublands, you had a
[SPEAKER_02]: larger percentage of carbon distributed in
the deeper part of your soils on one end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the spectrum, while in forest lands,
you ended up with carbon primarily in your
[SPEAKER_02]: top 20 centimeters of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was mostly explained in the
shrubland systems by how deep the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: were going and turning over in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the forest, like in deciduous
forests with leafs or coarse woody debris
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulating, you find a higher carbon in
the top 20 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brian kind of looked at this idea and
thought about where he could move forward
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two types of carbon that he wanted
to look at in these systems were organic
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon, as most people will be familiar
with, or carbon that's derived from a
[SPEAKER_02]: living source, either plant or animal,
and living and dead microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also wanted to look at inorganic
carbon, which in soils, to build your
[SPEAKER_02]: firms to carbon found in a carbonate form,
which is derived from mineral parent
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in urban systems in particular,
inorganic carbon is more of a question of
[SPEAKER_02]: protection than it is about sequestration.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the disturbances that go on in
urban ecosystems, by exposing these
[SPEAKER_02]: inorganic carbon deposits, you can
actually create a source for carbon into
[SPEAKER_02]: the atmosphere versus a sink, as we may
think about with organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a number of factors in
particular that affect carbon cycling
[SPEAKER_02]: within these soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to point out here is that
all the ones that I put stars next to,
[SPEAKER_02]: from here on down, are different factors
that can be affected by land management or
[SPEAKER_02]: by just how we use our land or our
presence on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so carbon cycling within the shallow
part of our soil is primarily derived from
[SPEAKER_02]: organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see high rates of turnover here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are sensitive to human
management and typically found in your
[SPEAKER_02]: organic or your A horizons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where deeper, beyond 20 centimeters,
it's a slower turnover rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find more of your inorganic carbon
sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also find organic sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where you start to find your A
horizons, your E horizons, and your B
[SPEAKER_02]: horizons as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to understand the framework of how the
Morton Arboretum wanted to construct the
[SPEAKER_02]: study looking at carbon based on land use,
they went back to a study that was
[SPEAKER_02]: conducted in 2010, also supported by the
Morton Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2010, the Morton Arboretum conducted a
tree census of the Chicagoland region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the tree census was is they
selected the seven counties around
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicago, as well as the city itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they generated 2,076 random plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out to each of these plots and
they looked at, they characterized the
[SPEAKER_02]: plots based on two sets of criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked at the plot information,
so what was the land being used for,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as percent tree cover,
shrub cover, and the shrub species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also when they found trees,
they would look at the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, they would characterize the
species, the stem diameter, tree height,
[SPEAKER_02]: crown height, and its general health,
how much missing foliage or dieback had
[SPEAKER_02]: occurred, crown light exposure,
and as well as distance to infrastructure
[SPEAKER_02]: or other buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took all this information and
they put it, they used it in the iTree
[SPEAKER_02]: model, which for people who aren't
familiar with this, is a model created by
[SPEAKER_02]: the USDA and used by urban foresters or
city planners to quantify the structure of
[SPEAKER_02]: urban forests within a municipality town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this model does is one,
it gives us a breakdown of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different species and how much canopy
cover, perhaps, you're finding within your
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also puts terms, it puts it in
terms of ecosystem services derived in a
[SPEAKER_02]: monetary value.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a way to justify
having an urban forest and maintaining it
[SPEAKER_02]: and diversifying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they used this model and created all
this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Bryant took this information and
they decided to, for this carbon study,
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a subset of these different land
use types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all the different land use
types that we looked at in the greater
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicago land region that we wanted to
assess for carbon cycling in those
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took a number of different types of
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took deep samples, using this,
it's hard to see in this picture,
[SPEAKER_02]: a large soil sampler that takes samples
down to a meter in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took shallow samples down to 20
centimeters, as well as our litter layer,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever was primarily on the top of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we brought these back to the lab and
based on, we'd look at each of the deep
[SPEAKER_02]: soil profiles based on horizons and
characterize them based on color,
[SPEAKER_02]: pH, texture, bulk density, soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would also take our litter extracted
and we would set them up and extract any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the invertebrates as maybe an
additional part of the study that they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be looking at in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at carbon in three different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at our inorganic and organic
carbon with elemental analysis and gas
[SPEAKER_02]: chromatography.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at our organic carbon
particularly in two ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is particulate organic matter and the
other one is using active carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna talk about these two tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So particulate organic matter is a way of
quantifying and looking at organic matter
[SPEAKER_02]: based on size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you do is you take your organic
matter and divide it from your sand silts
[SPEAKER_02]: and your clays and you fracture them into
different size classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of these, there's four different size
classes, three are represented here,
[SPEAKER_02]: the other one being smallest organic
matter that's associated with your silts
[SPEAKER_02]: and your clays, that's your organo-mineral
complex organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the theory goes is that depending on
the different size classes, each size
[SPEAKER_02]: class has a different residency time in
the soil with anywhere from our litter
[SPEAKER_02]: soil organic matter for being less than a
year to our organo-mineral complex organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter being anywhere from 400 to 1,000
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bryant had done a previous study in the
past where he looked at time since
[SPEAKER_02]: disturbance of sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long it had been since a site had
been in an urban ecosystem had been kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of created or established and looked at
particulate organic matter and found that
[SPEAKER_02]: this coarse particulate organic matter
particularly on the one to two years was a
[SPEAKER_02]: very good indicator for microbial biomass,
microbial biomass carbon as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen mineralization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this information if used could be
helped to use and figure out nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: calculations for street trees as the
theory went.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one way of looking at organic
matter that the Sharon Brock lab is very
[SPEAKER_02]: fond of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other technique that we used was
the active carbon test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for folks who are familiar with the
soil health test here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the preferred method that they
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a potassium permanganate oxidation
process and this has really started to
[SPEAKER_02]: become in favor for looking at our labile
organic matter, our organic matter that
[SPEAKER_02]: turns over quickly in the soil because
it's really easy to conduct it's on a
[SPEAKER_02]: colorimetric scale and they've known that
it's sensitive to changes in management
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see that it correlates well with
basal respiration, aggregation and
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all this information that the
Sharon Brock lab is working on is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be cycled into the i-tree model itself and
used to build a carbon model for soils
[SPEAKER_02]: based on land use type just like the
i-tree model had been used to create
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem services for above ground
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that about sums up the work that I did
at the Morton Arboretum or was involved
[SPEAKER_02]: with and I'm going to transition now to
talk about the research that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing while I've been at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for folks that saw me earlier this
year, what I've been working on while I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been here, I've been working on Nina
Bassack and Don Rakow and Harold Van Ness
[SPEAKER_02]: on the scoop and dump technique of soil
remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this technique is pretty much just
what it sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come in, we take compost, we put it on
impacted soils or compacted soils at a
[SPEAKER_02]: rate of six to eight inches and then we
come in with a backhoe, physically lift it
[SPEAKER_02]: up and drop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this creates is a heterogeneous
soil mixture that landscape plants can be
[SPEAKER_02]: directly planted into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, after the planting
mulch is added every year as you would
[SPEAKER_02]: find in most landscaping contexts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this technique was developed based on
two kind of studies, the first one being a
[SPEAKER_02]: study done in 1991 by Kai Rolfe who came
in without adding organic matter just
[SPEAKER_02]: using a backhoe to physically fracture
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he found when he did this,
looking at soil quality, he found that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil bulk density decreased, that pore
volume increased, and soil resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: so using a pentrometer in that soil,
also decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, a study done finished up in 2007
by Nina Bassack and Angela Rubenshield
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at using different types of organic
amendments and seeing how those affected
[SPEAKER_02]: soil bulk densities and soil porosities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we came up with using this
33% organic matter as an ideal amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the scoop and dump technique has had a
legacy of practice on the Cornell campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going on to year 14 now at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year Nina Bassack is creating the
urban eating class.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a year-long course in site
establishment of plants and woody plant
[SPEAKER_02]: ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: The class will design, create,
and install a new garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd been doing this technique for
more than 12 years when I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been used to restore sites such
as, some people will recognize this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is outside of Mann Library when it
was under construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And severely impacted soils occurred
during this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's a picture taken even a couple
years ago of what the landscape looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had seen that anecdotally,
we knew it was working, we had some
[SPEAKER_02]: research to back it up, but we wanted to
take it another step further and really
[SPEAKER_02]: see what the changes in soil quality had
occurred based on using this technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the first part of our study,
we selected six sites representing 12
[SPEAKER_02]: years to be studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four in our scoop and dump soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we selected four sites that were in
close proximity to our study sites that
[SPEAKER_02]: had gone through similar disturbance
regimes and could be used as a control or
[SPEAKER_02]: as a contrast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used the soil health test to look
at physical, biological, and chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of the soil in our initial study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way we sampled is we would dig
into our scoop and dump soil, and we would
[SPEAKER_02]: sample that, and then we'd go below our
scoop and dump layer into our subsoil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'd also sample that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for our controls, we would take
samples at equal depths to our scoop and
[SPEAKER_02]: dump as well as our subsoils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at soil resistance,
so coming in with a calibrated pentrometer
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing it all shortly after rainfall,
so very close to field capacity for soil
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture, we saw that in our scoop and
dump soil, that we started to see root
[SPEAKER_02]: limiting PSI, or root limiting resistance,
I should say, in our scoop and dump soil
[SPEAKER_02]: right around 25 centimeters in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to our unamended soils,
we found them right around nine
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeters in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about a three-fold increase in
available root depth that we were finding
[SPEAKER_02]: in our remediated sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, we look at this study in
two ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at it in a compare and contrast,
with our unremediated to our remediated
[SPEAKER_02]: sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at it over time,
since we had been doing this practice for
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, we saw that bulk density
decreased over time, with your zero being
[SPEAKER_02]: over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also noticed that our, or we found that
our potentially mineralizable nitrogen had
[SPEAKER_02]: increased over time, as well as our active
carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was exciting to see, and
certainly makes sense with the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: mineralizable nitrogen active carbon,
active carbon being a food source for soil
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganisms and organisms that are
involved in nitrogen mineralization,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the potential mineralizable nitrogen
increases we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the aggregate, sorry, the bulk density
increase was also exciting to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly with our increase in
aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were seeing that we were creating lower
bulk density soils, but they were also
[SPEAKER_02]: being maintained by this improvement in
structure, improvement in pore space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to summarize the other findings we
found from this initial study,
[SPEAKER_02]: we found also increased aggregate
stability, we found increased available
[SPEAKER_02]: water holding capacity, increased total
organic matter, increased potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: mineralizable nitrogen, bulk densities,
as well as active carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of a common scene of what
we would find in many of our sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: This site had only been installed one year
when we looked at it, but this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: profile difference, between our scoop and
dump soils compared to the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see, you know, we found this
all across the site that once we get down
[SPEAKER_02]: to that subsoil, which had higher bulk
densities typically, we would see the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots just start to move sideways instead
of continuing to move down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took all this information and we
wanted to think about how plants were
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in this type of environment and do a
study to follow up what we had learned in
[SPEAKER_02]: our first section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, we came up with a soil
container study where we wanted to conduct
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at how the plants, how plants
themselves would respond to these
[SPEAKER_02]: different soil mediums.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hypothesized that plants grown in
the scoop and dump soil will have
[SPEAKER_02]: increased biomass and this increased
biomass will be correlated with our
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced bulk density, our improved bulk
density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also hypothesized that because
of our increased water holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants grown in our scoop and dump
soil would have a better capability of
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with drought, particularly in
still model conductance as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis compared to our unamended
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took a subset of the sites we used
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We selected three sites and we selected
three controls that went along with them
[SPEAKER_02]: and we went out into the landscape and we
took large PVC cores and in this case we
[SPEAKER_02]: had to use a backhoe to drive these into
the ground and pull them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the best available technique
we have at getting as close to undisturbed
[SPEAKER_02]: soil samples as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perhaps a slight overestimate but
it's the best we work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have to use a backhoe in our
scoop and dump sites because the bulk
[SPEAKER_02]: density was decreased so it was a little
easier to sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we selected a woody plant to grow
in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We selected Ficus benjamina and we wanted
to use, we ended up using Ficus benjamina,
[SPEAKER_02]: one because it is known in tropical
regions of the world for being a street
[SPEAKER_02]: tree as we can see in this picture here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also wanted to use it to get around
the winter dormancy issue if we had
[SPEAKER_02]: selected a North American temperate
species which would have been ideal but we
[SPEAKER_02]: were working over the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we selected Ficus benjamina evergreen
and had tissue cultured plants donated to
[SPEAKER_02]: us from Sunshine Horticulture in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: All a pretty consistent size when we got
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we collected these soils outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought them into the greenhouse for a
short period and planted the Ficus
[SPEAKER_02]: directly into the different types of
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shortly after that we moved them into
growth chambers and allowed them to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: for three and a half months before we
decided to conduct our drought study.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end we ended up using 15 soils that
had been remediated and 15 soils that had
[SPEAKER_02]: been remediated with the scoop and dump
and 15 that had not been remediated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we subjected them to a period of 26
days of drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we started the study what we
did is we got the plants up to field
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we brought them up to a high point of
water holding and then let them drain and
[SPEAKER_02]: then wrap them in bags so that really the
only water that would be lost is through
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration and not evaporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our measurements that we wanted to look
at in the study were root and shoot
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Total leaf area and leaf water potential
at pre-dawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the soils characteristics that we
wanted to look at were gravimetric water
[SPEAKER_02]: content, volumetric water content and
texture, water holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_02]: total organic matter and bulk density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of gas exchange we looked at
photosynthesis as well as stone model
[SPEAKER_02]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we ended up finding from our study
was that our leaf area in our scoop and
[SPEAKER_02]: dump soils over here was greatly
increased, almost two fold compared to our
[SPEAKER_02]: unamended soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much more leaf area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that our root dry weight was
significantly increased in our scoop and
[SPEAKER_02]: dump soils compared to our unamended
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as our shoot dry weight was
significantly higher in our scoop and dump
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to our unamended soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at bulk density since this
has been a major question of our study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that in our scoop and dump
soils they were significantly lower than
[SPEAKER_02]: our unamended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for folks that aren't familiar with
bulk density, bulk density is a
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement of weight over volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grams per centimeter cubed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a study done by Datow and Warrington
had established a relationship between
[SPEAKER_02]: different textural classes and root
limiting bulk densities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found is that for your sands
you can get up to bulk densities around
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.75 grams per centimeters cubed before
you end up finding reduced bulk densities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for silts and clays it's around 1.4.
[SPEAKER_02]: So considering again that our scoop and
dump soils were well below this 1.4
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold was very good to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our unamended soils are
definitely getting into their range of
[SPEAKER_02]: root limiting bulk densities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have the textural textures
back from our study yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll be able to look at those
compared to these once those final tests
[SPEAKER_02]: are completed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did our linear regression looking at
our dry weight shoots with our bulk
[SPEAKER_02]: densities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see a clear relationship here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we overlay this with our different
types of treatments, our scoop and dump
[SPEAKER_02]: soils on the left here and our unamended,
we see a clear relationship between the
[SPEAKER_02]: bulk density and this improved scoop and
dump creating allowing for more shoots to
[SPEAKER_02]: be grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this line here represents root
limiting bulk density.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really strikingly kind of cutting them
right down the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw this relationship as well with
our roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's it with the overlay again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also saw this relationship with our
leaf area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again with this overlay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we destructively harvested
these, we obviously noticed certainly a
[SPEAKER_02]: much larger volume of roots in our scoop
and dump comparatively to our unamended
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one pattern that was very consistent,
here are pictures from our unamended
[SPEAKER_02]: sites, was you can see from how I'm
holding up these roots right here,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that in our unamended soils,
right here is kind of where we planted,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the plug was that we planted into
the soils themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a very consistent pattern where the
roots growing up across the top and then
[SPEAKER_02]: escaping down the sides of the containers
right down here in the area that had
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps a little extra space in it or did
not have the same type of bulk density as
[SPEAKER_02]: we found in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a very, very consistent
pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one that's interesting to think about,
since we did this in containers in the
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape, roots probably wouldn't have
this, or they certainly wouldn't have this
[SPEAKER_02]: container, a reduced area where they would
be able to go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually think that our roots are a
bit of an overestimate compared to our
[SPEAKER_02]: scoop and dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also very interesting to look at
the root exploration in our scoop and dump
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really saw that our roots were really
exploring and taking advantage of this
[SPEAKER_02]: increased structure with our aggregate
stability and able to find those pore
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces and really work their way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was interesting pulling them apart
because it would take a lot more work to
[SPEAKER_02]: break up the aggregates and actually free
the roots from the system compared to,
[SPEAKER_02]: in our unamended soils, where pretty much
you'd start to break it apart and the
[SPEAKER_02]: soils would just all fall away.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant was not holding very much onto
them because of this decrease in structure
[SPEAKER_02]: and root exploration throughout the soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at our leaf water potentials,
this is days of drought on the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: here, we see that as in both the unamended
and the scoop and dump soils, that really
[SPEAKER_02]: there wasn't much different in how these
plants were responding to drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of leaf water potentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we certainly saw a strong spike after
day 16 of our potentials starting to get
[SPEAKER_02]: really negative at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a fairly consistent pattern
that we saw with our photosynthetic rate
[SPEAKER_02]: and our gas exchange measurements as well,
where both the plants, there was no
[SPEAKER_02]: significant differences over the course of
the dry down experiment showing a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in photosynthetic rate as well
as stone model conductance was also had no
[SPEAKER_02]: significant differences between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started to think about this and
look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at, like I said,
water loss of the soils themselves over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the red up here is scoop and dump
soils and the blue is unamended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a cumulative water loss over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with this, what we see is that the
scoop and dump soils did, in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: hold and lose more water compared to our
unamended, which was corroborated with our
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in available water holding
capacity, where we lost 0.098 kilograms of
[SPEAKER_02]: water over the course of 26 days,
while about a little more than half of
[SPEAKER_02]: that in our unamended soils, just 0.65
kilograms of water loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at our water loss between
days, we also saw that as there were
[SPEAKER_02]: significant differences between days one
and day 16 in terms of amount of water
[SPEAKER_02]: loss between days with our scoop and dump
soils losing more water compared to our
[SPEAKER_02]: unamended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that difference no longer occurs
after day 21 and day 26.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so looking at all this, it starts to
make more sense that even though our scoop
[SPEAKER_02]: and dump soils held more water and we did
see an increase in both root growth as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as total leaf area, that there was an
increase in still model conductance,
[SPEAKER_02]: an increase in transpiration, which really
seemed to explain driving this pattern
[SPEAKER_02]: between our different soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'd like to thank my
committee and everyone else who's been a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of my research progress here,
as well as the Morton Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure I was
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to me like you had two types of
comparisons in your study of the scoop and
[SPEAKER_01]: dump soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one was the unamended versus the scoop
and dump, but then also the scoop and
[SPEAKER_01]: dumps against each other over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK, it was so quick that I didn't quite
catch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you saw increasing potentially
mineralizable nitrogen and active carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: and decreasing bulk density, the longer-
Over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you make of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the bulk density certainly
makes sense with the previous work that
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle had done in terms of loosening the
soil and maintaining that loosened soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: creating more pore space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also thinking about the increase in
aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the soil had been loosened and
aggregates were starting to form,
[SPEAKER_03]: that increase in structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That certainly makes sense in terms of
holding more pore space between the
[SPEAKER_02]: different aggregates and creating less
bulk in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the active carbon,
I think that certainly makes sense with
[SPEAKER_02]: the huge amount of organic matter that we
input initially, as well as the continued
[SPEAKER_04]: adding of organic matter that creates an
environment that is preferential for
[SPEAKER_04]: microbes to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: So over time, as we continue to add more
organic matter, we're kind of seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of seems like that initial
remediation sets the motion kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: virtuous cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have better aggregation,
it can sequester more carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because I would expect the immediate
difference between the two treatments,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that increase over time is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's something that you do tend to
see also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned in the study that Brian
shared before, we looked at time since
[SPEAKER_03]: disturbance.
[SPEAKER_03]: That after almost around 25 years,
you start to see soil start to cycle back
[SPEAKER_03]: in kind of a natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even without doing too much to your
landscape, you end up with new career
[SPEAKER_03]: soils without having to dodge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about that same part of
your study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you have the same species in all of
these landscapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly your plant material would
affect your soil characteristics as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if that landscape has been
established for some period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you always sampling near the same
species, or in an area with no plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: or how did that work now?
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran transects through our plots and
then went at certain intervals to reach
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we weren't as conscious of looking at
individual species.
[SPEAKER_03]: This first study was more just a survey to
look at what the changes in soil quality
[SPEAKER_03]: had been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm looking at a fine animal or a
fine teacong at 13, 14 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: In retrospect, what we've heard is that
every year we're going to plant one single
[SPEAKER_03]: species of animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we didn't do that, so we didn't quite
have the option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was something that we didn't
think about trying to look at in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at some of the plant responses,
since they all received very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: management over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we couldn't find any selections that
were really the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because part of the reason we create these
landscapes is to create diversity,
[SPEAKER_03]: learning opportunities for students in the
class.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in maybe a more traditional context,
where we have a one-to-one, we couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: meet every same species that we find in
our normal landscapes outside of the
[SPEAKER_05]: diversity sphere, that was an option for
this study.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the thing in the dump soil had higher
transpiration rates and larger leaves,
[SPEAKER_05]: why wasn't the water potential lower?
[SPEAKER_05]: And why wasn't the photosynthesis lower?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're drawing more water out of the can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it makes sense if you think
about the total leaf area in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: stoma conductance, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had greater leaf area in our scuba dump
soils almost twice as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was driving transpiration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that should have blown off more
water and made the soil drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though they had more leaf area,
we had higher water rolling capacities in
[SPEAKER_03]: our scuba dump soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a question on a totally different
topic that you also touched on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you talked about the importance of
volunteers in the botanical garden's
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really interested to know what you
think about if and how the principal
[SPEAKER_01]: investigators in contexts like that can
create a valuable kind of educational and
[SPEAKER_01]: or professional development experience for
those volunteers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could see how it could be very
much a kind of front work thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you don't get much out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can also see how you could shape it
to be something really transformative.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was interesting about Brian's lab
in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of all the labs out in Moreno,
he took advantage of volunteers like
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the type of people that volunteered
were really across the board from,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, he got his kids there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they didn't want to volunteer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from people who were in college who
didn't gain experience to, he had retired
[SPEAKER_02]: chemists in his lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just wanted to do something with their
time and take their skill and put it to
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for him, it's become a very
effective tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, he's been able to tap into a lot
of resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of having these people with
such depth of knowledge in different types
[SPEAKER_02]: of fields, they bring all sorts of
resources to the lab and a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at Botanic Gardens, there's this kind
of filtration of the history of the lab
[SPEAKER_03]: using volunteers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a great benefit to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've tried to think about how to apply
it into other contexts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Botanic Gardens are mission-based
organizations that people are comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: used to going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And visiting and having it, I've
experienced that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little different than what we
see in academics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be great to see it up there.
Thank you very much.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
