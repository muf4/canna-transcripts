[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks, everyone, for the invitation
to spend the day with you folks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I won't be continuing the
Alan, Marjorie, and Chris show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being from Boston, I can give you an
earful of unrecognizable pronunciations of
[SPEAKER_01]: words.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on that subject, am I in Jet's
country or Bill's country today?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to stir the pot a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to run through.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Bill, I'd like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm standing between you folks and lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather it be Bill standing between you
and lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: 1230.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue on with a few
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill started family business, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan, Michigan State, 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio State, 1982.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of miles on our tread.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think everyone here is very
energized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we need to measure
ourselves in terms of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of the energy that we're all
trying to share and continue experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reality check, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very shortly, this planet will be
inhabited by 9 billion individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, how many more until
feeding ourselves becomes a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a very sobering show on TV last week
that stated that 50% of the Earth's animal
[SPEAKER_01]: species are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the decline is going to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're displacing lots of other species.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to feed ourselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: For my personal story, I've shifted all of
my research activity from three years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was only researching ornamental
crops, to today, where 90% of my research
[SPEAKER_01]: activity is edible crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show an aerial photograph of my
family's operation in Andover in a slide
[SPEAKER_01]: or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The umbrella project that I'm writing and
speaking about, I've titled From Flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: to Food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, because I grew up on a truck
farm as a youngster and through high
[SPEAKER_01]: school, it's kind of poetic that it's
really not from flowers to food for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complete closing of a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started as food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to flowers when we could not make
a living in New England on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how balanced or
appropriate, inappropriate, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: adjective you want to use, that now my
family's operation, three years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: we shut the doors after 51 years of
growing flowers because there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: enough margin to keep, let's see,
two brothers, me, my parents, four
[SPEAKER_01]: households going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I'm very excited about
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to share that excitement with
you after a couple of additional sobering
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aphids grow wings when they overpopulate
host plants and fly to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're building rockets today so that when
we overpopulate, not if, but when we
[SPEAKER_01]: overpopulate the planet, we can find a new
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: A host plant, a host planet, silly me for
thinking that we're any smarter than an
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do believe we're smart enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I turn on the TV and see a show
with a couple that has 17 children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what is this all about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those souls is precious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would look at the parents and say,
I'm going to wake up a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is our industrial model of
agriculture sustainable?
[SPEAKER_01]: We came back from World War II and applied
an industrial model to our agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: system because it works so well to get us
through the war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has served us well in agriculture
for two or three generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of us in this room will now look at
California, Arizona agriculture and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it sustainable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be the answer for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to continue as seamlessly as I can
with Chris, Chris's final slide with the
[SPEAKER_01]: uptick in locally grown and whether it's
cut flowers or I'm going to be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, I'll talk about root crops
in plug trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any of us that have been growing
flower plugs and ornamentals for most of
[SPEAKER_01]: our careers, I've got some real cool
pictures to share with you of radishes,
[SPEAKER_01]: beets and carrots and how we might be able
to hit these locally grown food movement
[SPEAKER_01]: with some of our expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we return agriculture to the family
farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a farmer's market in Emmaus,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found very interesting with
this, I'm guessing, well, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: matriarch that is a linchpin, a backbone
of our greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my mom that's been the central
key point, the glue that holds things
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know any other person in this audience
that is on a family run operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this position that I'm
describing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't talk to this group to decide
whether or learn whether it's her daughter
[SPEAKER_01]: and son-in-law or her son and
daughter-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the second generation and then
so cool that we've got that third
[SPEAKER_01]: generation waiting in the wings to
continue this family farm approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a grower less than an hour from me
in Eastern Massachusetts, a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-generational family farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look out the glass glazing of the
sidewall of the greenhouse and see
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional outdoor row crop agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this family operation is an integrated
horticultural establishment today where
[SPEAKER_01]: they grew up on the farm, had a farm
stand, built greenhouses, got involved and
[SPEAKER_01]: diversified into flowers along with the
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really cool here, I stood in
there and I saw at this point what I
[SPEAKER_01]: determined was the future of some of our
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are baby greens being broadcast,
sown, in rows in open 1020 trays on a
[SPEAKER_01]: flood and drain or ebb and flood bench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were harvesting this crop in
three weeks from sow to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had the farm stand right there on
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really cool for me to see the
past or the traditional agriculture with
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we be healthier eating less but
higher quality food?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did high fructose corn syrup
accomplish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it nice to see some of the
manufacturers now listening and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that input?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why does our food have to be so cheap?
[SPEAKER_01]: This past Sunday I saw one of the early
morning news programs and there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: segment and I don't have the name of it
right but it was about the movement to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: migrant farm workers a more fair wage and
how the movement hit its head against the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall for many years going to the grocery
stores saying we need you to pay a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more for the produce so that we can pay
the pickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until they bypassed
distribution and went right to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer that they got the necessary
momentum and the program something like
[SPEAKER_01]: fair food or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it struck me because I have a real
issue with why in the United States our
[SPEAKER_01]: food has to be so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why as growers it's all about what
cost can we take out versus what quality
[SPEAKER_01]: can we put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the locally grown food movement with
all these participants increasing I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to toggle back and forth
between a farmers market in Boulder,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado that I visited last year and took
some really neat pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask you to from time to time
squint your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you some really nice
produce in the stalls and stands of the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers market and then I'm going to
toggle back to my research greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: activities and in the end say is there a
difference between the pictures that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that aerial view of the family
operation in Massachusetts, 55,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet down off the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grew up before this land was sold
to settle my grandfather's estate we had
[SPEAKER_01]: about 10 acres of land that we cultivated
and we trucked our produce into Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of you have been in the Faneuil
Hall tourist area of Boston before
[SPEAKER_01]: converting it to a tourist location I have
memories of driving in with my dad in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pickup truck loaded with the produce right
to those buildings and unloading in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stall where a commission agent would then
sell the produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point we've shut down the
family operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my brothers is running a few houses
for flower production to complement his
[SPEAKER_01]: landscaping activities and I've taken over
one house a 25 by 100 foot house for my
[SPEAKER_01]: research projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside this house today is completely
retooled for greenhouse hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable and herb production,
nutrient film channels, flood and drain
[SPEAKER_01]: benches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a 72 plug tray of radishes and
Marjorie, Alan, any of us in research we
[SPEAKER_01]: look back on your careers and we're lucky
if we have a handful of pictures that we
[SPEAKER_01]: call winners and money shots and this one
as a matter of fact is about 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I ever thought of researching
radishes you know the saying you take the
[SPEAKER_01]: boy off the farm but you don't take the
farm out of the boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years I had a corner of a greenhouse
that I would grow fresh vegetables for
[SPEAKER_01]: just my family's consumption and as I was
the one doing the sowing and plug
[SPEAKER_01]: producing on our operation it didn't take
long to use my imagination and start
[SPEAKER_01]: growing some radishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an old picture and what I found
really interesting is I'm going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: you a few more pictures from this past
year where I'm digging into the research
[SPEAKER_01]: side of this a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's toggle back to Boulder for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all those root crops ladies and
gentlemen from the turnips, beets,
[SPEAKER_01]: the carrots, the colors, the freshness,
the farmers market, locally grown food,
[SPEAKER_01]: this whole thing I find very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find I'm very fortunate to be able to
research in this area, travel around the
[SPEAKER_01]: country and learn as much as I can about
our young generation of consumers that is
[SPEAKER_01]: telling us they want locally grown food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also telling us that they'd like
to eat seasonally and I describe my
[SPEAKER_01]: generation as being spoiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the grocery store supermarket
generation where over our lives wasn't it
[SPEAKER_01]: so cool that any day of the year we could
go to the grocery store and get anything
[SPEAKER_01]: from any place on the planet and now our
children are saying that that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable Alan you've referenced your
daughter often in your presentation our
[SPEAKER_01]: children are probably of similar ages and
I'm crediting them when I'm with them
[SPEAKER_01]: saying you guys are fueling this you're
going to change the way we feed ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of a crop of radishes
that I grew last year the long icicle
[SPEAKER_01]: shape look at the different colors and
over by the way that's a carrot shaped
[SPEAKER_01]: like a radish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my messages for fellow growers
in the audience is guys this is only how
[SPEAKER_01]: far will our imagination take us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan did a great job talking about
breeding and the opportunities that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just there and there's a project I have a
second project looking at LED lighting and
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor warehouse food production and in my
opinion the breeding efforts the cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that we need for those production systems
are right around the corner waiting for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a five inch deep nursery plug tray
okay let's grow it let's get going we can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow some carrots we can grow some beets
this is a the Nantes type carrot with that
[SPEAKER_01]: wide shoulder this is a 50 plug tray with
the five inch deep you know intended for
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery stock and that's a that's a pretty
cool crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now cultivar selection is important so
most of the cultivars that I'm showing
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of today when I was selecting
them in seed catalogs they were always
[SPEAKER_01]: described with the words miniature fast
crop you know you don't want to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow an eight inch long carrot in a five
inch deep plug tray but how cool some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these this was a trial with two different
cultivars and how cool we match up the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar with the plug tray and we're good
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a turnip and I have this picture to
illustrate the following I want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: your attention to the external root mat
from that plug tray now anyone in this
[SPEAKER_01]: room who's grown ornamental crop plugs we
do we go out of our way to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't happen we don't want roots
external to the plug tray I found after
[SPEAKER_01]: one round of work that's exactly what I do
want in this crop so we have to turn what
[SPEAKER_01]: we've learned on its ear from time to time
and here's where I see production of this
[SPEAKER_01]: group of crops going I'd like to see a new
plug trade designed with instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum cell volume that we want for
petunias and geranium plugs I'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum cell volume the growing medium in
my opinion in this system is only to
[SPEAKER_01]: support the seed and allow it to germinate
once the root gets down to the flood and
[SPEAKER_01]: drain environment this interface is where
all the action is so I see new plug trays
[SPEAKER_01]: designed for this type of food crop
production where much significantly less
[SPEAKER_01]: growing mix will go into the plug tray
because we only need that root to get down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the outside a couple of slides showing
how cultivars are different this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: miniature white turnip and it was very
easy to harvest with two fingers just
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling it and that fairly weak tap root
would slide right out of the ground it's
[SPEAKER_01]: mate a red turnip was much different where
it sat deeper in the growing mix and you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: need two hands to remove the roots from
that turnip so there's an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: us and plant breeders to develop cultivars
that will sit on top of the mix for
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting purposes and I always like to
show slides where we can say you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fun to grow plants and it's fun to work
with plants for a living harvest size
[SPEAKER_01]: maturity we certainly need to match those
things up depending on the density of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the cell and how many you're trying to
grow in a square foot versus how long are
[SPEAKER_01]: we going to grow them and we can get real
cute with this trying to fit round pegs in
[SPEAKER_01]: square holes two hands weren't enough to
get that out I needed a jackhammer let's
[SPEAKER_01]: go to radishes for a few slides set and
this this research this experiment was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at density and and and yield so I
had on the left a 72 plug tray a 105 and a
[SPEAKER_01]: 128 and after growing to maturity I
removed the tops of the plants to take
[SPEAKER_01]: this picture the 72 plug trays the 105 the
128 and then went a step further harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: weighed did all that so the left hand row
is the 72 105 128 if I'm not going too
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly the bottom row is what we'd say is
the acceptable market size the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: ones then in the middle is an intermediate
medium-sized radish and then some
[SPEAKER_01]: pea-sized small radishes up above so as we
would predict the larger cell size the 72
[SPEAKER_01]: tray produced the highest proportion of
large radishes to small and as we got into
[SPEAKER_01]: a tighter configuration with 128 we had
more of the medium and small okay what's
[SPEAKER_01]: it all mean I brought those home and took
the marketable ones and slice them as you
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do for our salads and instead of
saying these are not marketable the medium
[SPEAKER_01]: and small size I started imagining well
with a smaller size radish we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to slice it probably get our fingers
before we get the slices of the radish but
[SPEAKER_01]: we might just cut it in half and sprinkle
it on the salad and then instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing out these pea-sized they were
actually the size of green olives so I got
[SPEAKER_01]: to thinking this happened to be after a
couple of home-brewed beers that afternoon
[SPEAKER_01]: and by the way my garden Ellen I used to
have a 25 by 30 vegetable garden off the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of my house I started home brewing
beer about eight years ago it didn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: two years for the vegetables to go and the
hops to so I've got a wall of hops the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of this screen screaming to be
harvest in the next day or two anyways
[SPEAKER_01]: this imagination why can't we grow a
radish that doesn't need to be sliced and
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinkled like a green olive the only
downside I see is an oil based salad
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing some of these trying to stab them
with a fork might end up on what movie was
[SPEAKER_01]: that where it ended up on a neighbor's
plate all right this is a 288 plug tray of
[SPEAKER_01]: radish just to see how far the envelope
can be pushed and it's almost blurring a
[SPEAKER_01]: line between being a sprout or being a
radish so I'm going to do some work
[SPEAKER_01]: continue there and see where it leads I
think some some some growth regulation I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: dying to look at some floral work on on
systems like this from years ago I've had
[SPEAKER_01]: slides of geranium cuttings where it
appeared that they were rooted more
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily after floral treatment on the
stock plant or in a plug tray and my
[SPEAKER_01]: reasoning back then was where we're
encouraging vegetative growth and the root
[SPEAKER_01]: is a vegetative organ so I want to take
that little concept and see if it will
[SPEAKER_01]: translate and and produce a uniform radish
with a smaller top now this is dangerous
[SPEAKER_01]: before lunch but your conference
organizers asked me to put a little
[SPEAKER_01]: economics into this presentation so I'm
going to go through about five minutes and
[SPEAKER_01]: give you my take which is a bit
untraditional on how we look at some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our production costs but just bear with me
for a few slides this is on the handout
[SPEAKER_01]: for those of you that might want to take
these tables home with you first we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to handle a discussion of overhead costs
and the left-hand column is a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars per square foot per week as a
means of describing overhead cost the
[SPEAKER_01]: column I added next to it is multiplying
that per square foot per week out by 52
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks just to get an idea just to get wrap
our arms around how much is it costing for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to remember the title of this
presentation is from flowers to food so my
[SPEAKER_01]: premise is that many of us in the audience
are currently growing ornamental crops
[SPEAKER_01]: some of us might not be satisfied with the
money we're making on flowers and we might
[SPEAKER_01]: be looking at a corner of a greenhouse a
bay of a section of the operation to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert from flowers to food so I thought
it would be good to to go through some
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional cost analysis in the end we're
going to be faced with saying okay I can
[SPEAKER_01]: make more per square foot growing flowers
so that's what I'll grow or I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: more per square foot growing vegetables
that's what I'm going to do in those
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet so the following columns are
taking square foot per week and converting
[SPEAKER_01]: it to a 1020 tray so a 1020 tray is 1.6
square feet and that's what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do in these columns then we're going to
look at various crop cycles just to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: things in a bit so as an example a very
fairly common square foot per week
[SPEAKER_01]: overhead cost is 25 cents and if we look
at 25 cents in a 1020 tray for a
[SPEAKER_01]: three-week crop cycle it would be a dollar
twenty for your overhead costs are we okay
[SPEAKER_01]: there if we go to four weeks six weeks
eight weeks now what what do these cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: match up with for vegetable crops this
would be baby greens radish four weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: turn up more like six weeks carrots eight
weeks all right so just for us to wrap our
[SPEAKER_01]: arms around it I'm not asking you to
memorize or you know just just for a an
[SPEAKER_01]: introductory conversation so I'm going to
concentrate on the column for radish just
[SPEAKER_01]: for simplicity today and we'll come back
to that in a moment so you've got that
[SPEAKER_01]: table you can do whatever you want with it
variable cost per tray 72 tray 128 288
[SPEAKER_01]: again looking at this radish example that
I'm I'm running through catalogs tray
[SPEAKER_01]: price is very similar for these three
different trays I'm assuming we can use a
[SPEAKER_01]: tray for four crops with some sanitizing
in between crops so that brings that
[SPEAKER_01]: variable cost down into the 40 cent range
then we look at the growing medium which I
[SPEAKER_01]: assume is fairly similar because the 72
cell is a larger cell but fewer cells
[SPEAKER_01]: right we start adding cells but the cell
size decreases so I kind of comes out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wash and you follow that argument
through the tray in the media 75 80 cents
[SPEAKER_01]: per tray and then the one that does change
is the as a variable cost is the cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: the radish seed so when we go from 72
seeds up to 288 seeds then we've got more
[SPEAKER_01]: money that we're putting into that tray so
add all those things up folks and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at somewhere under over a dollar
right another word round numbers this is
[SPEAKER_01]: very chunky big chunk cost analysis now
this this one this part I want to well
[SPEAKER_01]: many of us as small growers are guilty of
not factoring into our cost analyses our
[SPEAKER_01]: salaries many small operations wait till
the end of the season and whatever's left
[SPEAKER_01]: in their pocket ends up being his or her
salary as the small business owner so I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to kind of play on that off of that a
bit and I'm going to approach this
[SPEAKER_01]: differently so I'm going to to say how
much of the greenhouse range am I
[SPEAKER_01]: considering shifting over to food crops
and once I decide how much room I have how
[SPEAKER_01]: much money do I want left in my pocket at
the end of the year all right so if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing whether to go geraniums or
radishes for me to change from geraniums
[SPEAKER_01]: to radishes it's got to put more money in
my pocket so the way I'm I'm going through
[SPEAKER_01]: this this little table is for instance if
I'm going to put 10,000 square feet or a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of an acre into radish production
and please with me I'm saying radishes but
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm meaning anything edible okay if I want
to make $25,000 off of that 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet my overhead cost is going to go up by
a nickel a square foot per week does that
[SPEAKER_01]: make sense in other words I'm factoring in
my salary what do I want my salary to be
[SPEAKER_01]: to justify going into the vegetable crops
if I want to make $50,000 naturally it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to contribute more to the overhead
cost and then if I fill things in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit the more space I want to put into
vegetable crops the lower that overhead
[SPEAKER_01]: cost becomes if I want to make a lot of
money I'm probably going to want to put a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of space into production all right
enough back to this slide let's now zero
[SPEAKER_01]: in on and finish this little thread
talking about radishes starting with that
[SPEAKER_01]: common 25 cent overhead now if on the
previous slide I said I want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: $25,000 dollars 10,000 square feet it
contributes a nickel that nickel of
[SPEAKER_01]: overhead per square foot per week will
translate into 30 cents per tray right and
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this dangerous right before lunch
going going through this I'm glad the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights are up shift gears now I went into
the grocery store this this well I took a
[SPEAKER_01]: morning this was fun this was good
research I went to Walmart I never go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart I Walmart is the evil Empire for
me yeah everybody hear that all right no
[SPEAKER_01]: spell check on this guy so Walmart my
local regional store is called Market
[SPEAKER_01]: Basket and then I went in Whole Foods so
as expected Whole Foods was the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of radishes $2 for the bunch there
were only nine radishes but it was organic
[SPEAKER_01]: the Walmart 94 cents the cheapest there
were 12 radishes in the bunch at my local
[SPEAKER_01]: chain this was the bag of radishes without
the greens that you're familiar with 23 in
[SPEAKER_01]: there say two dozen and they also had the
live bunch with greens 99 cents blah blah
[SPEAKER_01]: blah all right so they need not really
interesting to you but you know I weighed
[SPEAKER_01]: the fresh weight clean the tops off weight
per radish all that stuff but but the
[SPEAKER_01]: point that I want to bring out here is is
this range of retail costs and from this
[SPEAKER_01]: range I chose a dollar 49 as the retail
price that I'm going to use in the
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis next step I'm assuming that we
have a 85% yield in these various plug
[SPEAKER_01]: trays so in a 72 tray 85% yield will give
us five bunches of a dozen each if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: selling at a dollar 49 the revenue 760
blah blah blah okay this slide kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: summarizes it the overhead cost that I was
zeroing in on ranged from a dollar 60 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 224 the variable cost of the total
production cost 248 to 337 and again this
[SPEAKER_01]: this big chunky cost analysis the
potential revenue 760 to 1013 from the
[SPEAKER_01]: previous slide so so it is more a proof of
concept folks does it even make sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this we know we can grow them but is it
going to make money for us to to shift and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and this this first time through with
these numbers the revenue is higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost by enough that I want to keep
pushing the pencil right so so I think my
[SPEAKER_01]: first year in this project was proof of
concept in terms of the production of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop once we determine that it's only our
imagination we can grow anything we want
[SPEAKER_01]: in a hydroponic environment then we we
pressed on the economics a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers at least right now are there
so so I think that we're going to be in in
[SPEAKER_01]: good shape we much mentioned local adult I
mean young adults asking for locally grown
[SPEAKER_01]: food they want to eat what's in season
this is key so far this generation is
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to pay a premium and I want to
keep them away from Walmart and not poison
[SPEAKER_01]: them with this cheap is best they're
saying that my earlier question would we
[SPEAKER_01]: be healthier eating less but higher
quality food they're saying yes yes we
[SPEAKER_01]: want that here is that boulder farmers
market showing the diversity in tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: this slide really intrigued me because the
cut flowers in the lower right are showing
[SPEAKER_01]: us this diversified horticulture where
we've got flora culture in with the food
[SPEAKER_01]: production and the what struck me is the
interaction the intimacy of the farmer to
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer relationship and that's something
that we don't have in a supermarket or
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store any of us in garden
centering we've always held hung our hats
[SPEAKER_01]: on quality and service the service part
being that that that intimacy with our
[SPEAKER_01]: with our customer Alan kudos for the app
and bringing more education to this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: table so that we can all do a better job
as with flowers folks anchor in specialty
[SPEAKER_01]: items particularly local populations
ethnic preferences breeding is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring all kinds of opportunities when
bright lights Swiss chard was released
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago it blurred the line between the
flower garden and the vegetable garden
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked today about the deck becoming
the garden and it's going to be blurred
[SPEAKER_01]: lines between food crops and ornamentals
we have carrots shaped like radish beets
[SPEAKER_01]: shaped like carrots it's like whatever we
ask plant breeders to give us they will
[SPEAKER_01]: and I find that very exciting here is Pac
Choi in in an ebb and flood environment
[SPEAKER_01]: the deep nursery tray at harvest this
slide in particular illustrates the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar selection part of this process so
in a in a high density planting we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go more for the smaller compact miniature
cultivar so that we can avoid the diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: and avoid the missteps in production we
can also force these into a this a 50 cell
[SPEAKER_01]: tray grown more as a baby green and you've
seen that product in the grocery store
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a pristine glacial lake in college
Colorado unfortunately I use it to to to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a couple of comments about freshwater
and I think in our lifetimes we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see that wars will not be fought over
fuel fossil fuels wars will be fought over
[SPEAKER_01]: water I think we're already witnessing
this in the state of California where the
[SPEAKER_01]: battle is between municipalities and
agriculture and if I were to put my money
[SPEAKER_01]: on who's going to win I think it's going
to be municipalities so we need to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: this out and we need to do it quickly I
think I'm going to skip through final
[SPEAKER_01]: question can we return all of our
agriculture to the local level my opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: no we can't we can't completely displace
industrialized agriculture there's I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's enough room to do all of
this but I do see a significant portion of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture being returned to its local
roots and with this field of celery that I
[SPEAKER_01]: stood at in southern California I brought
that feeling home and did some work with
[SPEAKER_01]: celery this past season looking at an 1801
cell a 37 and a 72 and what was really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool about this 80 days after plant these
three plants look very similar in that
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic environment where you can you
can see where we don't need all that
[SPEAKER_01]: growing medium anymore if we're delivering
the nutrients in that irrigation stream in
[SPEAKER_01]: a more frequent cycling and then at
harvest brought those home on the on the
[SPEAKER_01]: breadboard and again the imagination
squinting our eyes can we can we adapt and
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to have a huge stock or plant of
celery that we're currently buying in the
[SPEAKER_01]: supermarket can we buy smaller stocks of
celery that will allow me to grow it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter crop cycle so that I can make a
living growing celery for the local market
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll close with this in my experience if I
talk carrots and celery when I'm buying
[SPEAKER_01]: them in my local grocery store I've
learned the hard way less than half the
[SPEAKER_01]: time when I come home that celery is
tender and sweet less than half the time
[SPEAKER_01]: the other times it's bitter rubbery same
for carrots sweet tender we we can do all
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can control all of that in the
systems that we're discussing today so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the quality part of it and if if our
youngsters continue to say I'll give you
[SPEAKER_01]: an extra nickel for that so that I can
make a living doing it then I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everything becomes more fair everything is
going to work out I think that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be it I ended with tomato so many of us
talk tomatoes today thank you very much
[SPEAKER_00]: for the invitation this has been a
production of Cornell University on the
[SPEAKER_00]: web at Cornell edu you
