[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Anna.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Marjorie Hanneman, as Anna
said, and I'm a second year in the Gore
[SPEAKER_04]: lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my research project that I'm focusing
on today is the analysis of vitamin B3 or
[SPEAKER_04]: niacin in maize grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: To give a cultural context to vitamin B3
in maize, we need to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: nixtamalization, which is a traditional
cultural practice from Central America
[SPEAKER_04]: where the maize kernels are cooked in lime
and then eventually ground to create a
[SPEAKER_04]: masa to make tortillas or tamales or other
corn based foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing about this process, though,
is that it increases the bioavailability
[SPEAKER_04]: of vitamin B3.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in maize diets, where it's the
predominant food, there are in cultures
[SPEAKER_04]: that don't have nixtamalization,
we see severe B3 deficiency and diseases
[SPEAKER_04]: such as pellagra occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is predominantly because vitamin
B3 is mostly unavailable in the maize
[SPEAKER_04]: grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have this pathway here showing nicotinic
acid or niacin, which is our main form of
[SPEAKER_04]: B3.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a trigonelline is the N-methyl
derivative of niacin, where this compound
[SPEAKER_04]: is inactive and undigestible because of
this methylation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the majority of corn kernels,
this is predominantly the form of B3.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vitamin B3 is also essential, specifically
to the NAD cycle, where living organisms
[SPEAKER_04]: get the majority of their energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the three compounds in the previous
slide listed here, showing that
[SPEAKER_04]: trigonelline is an offshoot of this cycle,
more of a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some thoughts that it's
involved in plant growth hormones,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for our cycle we're focusing on here
is vitamin B3.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is inactive and is an offshoot from the
necessary cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to further look into the B3 compounds
in maize grain, we used a high throughput
[SPEAKER_04]: LCMS to phenotype these three compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I had mentioned in the cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at about 1,500 different maize
lines, we can see that there were three
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically that have extremely low
trigonelline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be the blue, green,
and red triangles, specifically T2-3-2,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we will focus on is a breeding line
out of Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those same three have an elevated level of
nicotinic acid or niacin, the active
[SPEAKER_04]: compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's suggesting that something is
happening between the nicotinic acid and
[SPEAKER_04]: niacin step and trigonelline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also interesting though is that for
nicotinamide, they're all at average
[SPEAKER_04]: levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're wanting to focus on specifically
what is happening between those two
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our main question for this project is
what is genetically causing this extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: high niacin level and low trigonelline
level in the T2-3-2 maize grain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Comparing the T2-3-2 line B3 composition
with B1-04, which is a fairly standard
[SPEAKER_04]: line that we chose because of its ability
to be transformed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the difference in trigonelline
levels where it's basically a sliver here
[SPEAKER_04]: in T2-3-2.
[SPEAKER_04]: So choosing this average line in an
extreme phenotype, we crossed them and
[SPEAKER_04]: self to make an F2 population so that we
can identify causal variants that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for these unique rare
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within our F2 progeny, this is a
distribution of the trigonelline
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very interesting because you can
see that there's a three to one ratio here
[SPEAKER_04]: to presence absence of trigonelline with a
zero, absolutely no trigonelline compared
[SPEAKER_04]: to where B1-04 is where it is a continuous
distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would suggest that there's some sort
of genetic switch that has a homozygous
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive allele that is causing an
absence of trigonelline and then to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: continuous quantitative phenotype for
presence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then genotyping our F2 population with
RHAMP-seq and then inputting it into an
[SPEAKER_04]: ICIM software.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were doing a QTL analysis to look at
the three phenotypes that we were
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we specifically wanted to look at
trigonelline where we had a very large QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: on chromosome four and also seeing it in
nicotinic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would suggest that there is a
single locus that's going to be associated
[SPEAKER_04]: with the niacin to trigonelline pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now nicotinamide also had a few QTL peaks,
but we are specifically going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in only nicotinic acid and
trigonelline for now and look into that
[SPEAKER_04]: later since it had more average phenotypes
for our extreme lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: This QTL was also about two megabases wide
with 51 genes in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are hoping to narrow that down
and think and identify genes that are
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically involved in methylation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And specifically here is our NAD cycle
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is causing this to stop?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for our next steps of this project
would be to integrate our QTL results with
[SPEAKER_04]: GWAS, TWAS and EQTL, specifically from
those 15,000 lines we originally looked at
[SPEAKER_04]: to see if there are any genes that would
be hit here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because this is a rare phenotype,
it would be interesting to see what else
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be identified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, we'll use orthologous
information from other model plant species
[SPEAKER_04]: such as Arabidopsis to prioritize our
selection of possible causal genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then using de novo assembly of T232
genome, we can identify the causal
[SPEAKER_04]: variants and see if they are also present
in the other two extreme lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to acknowledge my
committee members and specifically the
[SPEAKER_04]: Gore lab and our collaborators at Georgia,
Michigan State and Iowa State.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for the bi-parental
population that you develop or that you
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know why you use the average line
instead of another extreme at a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was, why did we choose an
average line to make the bi-parental
[SPEAKER_04]: population instead of using two extreme
lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was because the average line we chose
B104 is transformable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then later down the line,
we would be able to use that line to use
[SPEAKER_04]: gene editing or something else to confirm
causal genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was going to ask, what do you
know about the background of the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have a hypothesis as to why
this is so rare?
[SPEAKER_04]: The background of the line was it was a
traditional breeding line from Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a non-stiff stock line.
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of the extreme lines were not
the same a heterotic group though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am thinking that this is a mutation in a
single gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be resulting in that it
continued.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not seeing it in any other lines
could be because there wasn't enough of a
[SPEAKER_04]: mutation to have a selection over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Kelly, just to add the mutation doesn't
appear to be lethal, but it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: occurring at very rare variant frequency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe like a more recent mutation or
there's just no selection?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, well, probably a combination
of both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it did happen, say 80,000 years ago
through fruit drift, it could have been
[SPEAKER_03]: lost, but it probably occasionally occurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had your hand first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said it's not a lethal phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it show any other phenotypes or just
the plant itself other than the different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels?
[SPEAKER_04]: The question was if the plant otherwise
looks the same because of the extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: low trigonellian lines, specifically
T2-3-2, there's not anything obvious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look more into how does if
trigonellian is going to be used as a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant hormone, how does that affect
growth?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the extreme lines, G14 though,
is very difficult to get seed from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just add that this is a seed
phenotype, but we haven't looked at in
[SPEAKER_03]: other tissues outside of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the trigonellian an anti-nutritional
factor?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: To eat outside of the fact that it
prevents you from getting vitamin B3,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just undigestible and unprocessable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes through a human body.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know of any negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
