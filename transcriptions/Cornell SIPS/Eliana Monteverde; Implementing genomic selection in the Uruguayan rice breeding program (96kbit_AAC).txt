[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody, and thank you very much
for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's very cold and it's early in
the morning, so I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Susan told you recently,
I used to work in Uruguay at the
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had just finished my masters in
which I did my master in genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms of genetic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, mechanisms or controlling cold
tolerance in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had just finished my master and I was
looking for a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was collaborating very closely with the
Uruguayan Rice Breeding Program at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never worked for the Uruguayan Breeding
Program, but I used to collaborate a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was looking for a PhD, as I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Uruguayan Breeding Program is a
small and traditional breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they were trying to do,
they were trying to start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to implement genomic selection in the
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I was around, I took that task
and I decided to make my PhD project in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I tried to do is to explore some
of the aspects related to implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection in the rice breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I did the best choice,
but that's how I got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what and where is
Uruguay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay is this very tiny little country
here in southern South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here in this map,
it's right in the limit between the
[SPEAKER_00]: subtropical and temperate zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this reason, the Uruguayan climate
can be classified as humid subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four very well-defined seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the most extreme, of course,
are winter and summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the winter runs from June to August,
where the average temperature can go
[SPEAKER_00]: between 3 to 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the summer season that
runs from December to March, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: average temperatures can be between 17 to
28 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this reason, rice cycle usually
takes over during this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since temperatures during the winter
are so low for rice, we can only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle of rice a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we usually don't tend to associate
Uruguayan rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, rice is not near Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rice is the third top export from
Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay is mainly an agricultural country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rice comes right after beef and
soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Uruguay is among the top 10
major rice exporters in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually in the first place in
Latin America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 95% of the rice production is
exporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not a rice-consuming country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this reason, we have to meet very
high standards for grain quality to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to export our product in the
international market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as you can see here in this
plot, Uruguayan's rice yield are also very
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're between 8 to 10 tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see here in the plot,
this is the progression of rice yields
[SPEAKER_00]: since the 1970s, where the rice-grain
program was first established in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see how grain yields were
increasing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was thanks to the adoption of new
high-yielding varieties, but also to the
[SPEAKER_00]: investment in the adoption of new
agricultural practices and also a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, the high-yielding varieties
from Uruguay were developed by the INIA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the National Agricultural
Research Institute in Uruguay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Uruguayan Rice Breeding Program
belongs to INIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this breeding program consists mainly
of, it's divided in two main breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, which is the Tropical Japonica
Breeding Program and the Indica Breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tropical Japonica consists mainly of
lines that were introduced from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 70s, and they were adapted to
Uruguayan conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Indica German Plasm consists
mainly of varieties that were introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: from Irri in the Philippines and Silla in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only three main, three
varieties that were released by INIA
[SPEAKER_00]: account for 92% of the planted rice area,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these main three varieties are El Paso
144 and Olimar, which are Indica
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the Tropical Japonica
variety, which is Inia Tahuari.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main problem we're facing right now
is that these varieties are reaching their
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are, and this was thanks to all the
improvements we did in the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really in the urge to develop new
varieties with higher yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also yield is not, everything in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain quality is very important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we export most of our
production, we really need to meet those
[SPEAKER_00]: high standards in international markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main components of physical quality
are length and width, which determine
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of grain we're having,
either short, medium, or long grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then head rice yield is a very
important component of grain quality
[SPEAKER_00]: because head rice yield is the weight of
whole kernels, because nobody likes broken
[SPEAKER_00]: kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important and it really
determines the price of the rice bag in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then color is important and also chalk
is another very important trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chalk, because chalk really induces
grain breakage, so it reduces head rice
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chalk is this opaque area in the
grains that is caused by misfolding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amylose and amylopectin layers during
grain peeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, this opaque area induces
grain breakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very important trait too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cracks are also important because they
also induce breakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that milling quality traits and
yield are the traits I'm focusing here in
[SPEAKER_00]: my project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we know these traits are
quantitative traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genomic selection could be a good
strategy to improve these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what basically my project was,
was to explore different, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of implementing genomic selection
to improve both grain and milling quality
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly I focused on, evaluated
the impact of accounting for G by E in our
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also in the G by E area, we compare
different ways to fit weather covariates
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed our models and improve our
prediction accuracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another thing, it was to use genomic
selection to select the best combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: of parents to cross and start new breeding
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like a bonus track of the
thesis, which is finding genomic regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are associated to anthropocultural
response when we try to develop haploid
[SPEAKER_00]: lines for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time, the first thing I'm
gonna talk to you about is to evaluate how
[SPEAKER_00]: to evaluate prediction accuracies for
yield and milling quality when we account
[SPEAKER_00]: for G by E in our germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a part of our work we
published in CropScience last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different ways to
account for G by E statistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were focused mainly on using mixed
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the mixed model we used had this
general form where we have a trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: our response variable, which is the
measurements of the traits for all
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes in all environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our, the mean of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this genetic component,
which is a random genetic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this random, this genetic effects have
a normal distribution with this covariance
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, which can be modeled by the
chronic product between two different
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: One environmental component, which is this
UE matrix here that represents the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: covariance between environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this K is the genetic covariance
between lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the genetic component of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of ways to, there's a
lot of structures for these genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: covariance between environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two, we were focused only in two
main structures, which are the,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually they're kind of like opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the diagonal matrix and the
unstructured matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diagonal matrix, what it does,
it fits one single variance per
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it treats, and then there's no
covariance between environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by this way, we're accounting is the
same as fitting environments or treating
[SPEAKER_00]: them as independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not sharing information between
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the unstructured covariance matrix
is, as the diagonal matrix, it fits one
[SPEAKER_00]: single variance per environment,
but it also fits a covariance between
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to compare our prediction
accuracies with these two methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The datasets we used were Tropico-Japonica
and Indica dataset that consisted both of
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 elite breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these lines were evaluated in three
different years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traits we used were yield,
milling, yield measured in kilograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then milling yield, head rice percentage,
and grain chauvinism.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three main components of
milling quality and plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna explain now how we phenotype
these traits because we're gonna refer to
[SPEAKER_00]: them along with the whole presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we first get our harvest,
our rice from the field, we get our,
[SPEAKER_00]: the patty rough, the patty rice or rough
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the grains that's still,
they're still attached to the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to de-hole these grains to
obtain the brown rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brown rice will go then, will pass
through the mill and it will be to obtain
[SPEAKER_00]: the white rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after milling, we're gonna obtain,
we're gonna obtain our white rice which
[SPEAKER_00]: is, it constitutes of both whole kernels
and also broken kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the total amount of both whole and
broken kernels is the milling yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative to the original amount of rice,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the head rice is only when we
separate both broken from whole kernels is
[SPEAKER_00]: the total amount of whole kernels relative
to the original amount of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then chauvinism is the third component
which is measured as total chalky rice
[SPEAKER_00]: over the total milled rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chalky grain is, grain is considered
as chalky as chalky, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the chalky area is more than 50% of
the total grain area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For, so we used several cross validation
schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm gonna show you just a few of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, we use a cross validation one
and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the cross validation one is,
fits, sorry, tries to predict lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: were never evaluated in an environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are new lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cross validation two predicts
lines that were evaluated in some
[SPEAKER_00]: environments but not in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're really using the information
that runs through the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: covariance matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the results from the
prediction accuracies for each trait in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indica data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a lot of things going
on in this part, but I want you to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: only on these two pink bars for each year
and each trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two pink bars correspond to the
cross validation scheme two, the one when
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to predict lines that were,
sorry, tested in some environments but not
[SPEAKER_00]: in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the unstructured covariance matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then these are actually the only ones
that are kind of like more different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for tropical japonica, we see kind of
the same trend, but it's not as pronounced
[SPEAKER_00]: as with the Indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, using the cross validation two with
the unstructured covariance matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can achieve the better prediction
accuracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another cross validation scenario we
tested and I'm gonna tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: wanna talk about today is when we're
trying to predict new environments or
[SPEAKER_00]: environments that were never evaluated
before, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, since environments are years,
we're trying to predict future years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the information from previous years
and the training process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see when predicting every
each year for both the Indica and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical japonica for each trait using the
diagonal and the unstructured covariance
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that in each case,
prediction accuracy is a little higher
[SPEAKER_00]: when using the unstructured covariance
matrix than the diagonal matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually using this kind of,
fitting these kinds of models that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: us to borrow information between
environments really helps us to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: our lines to achieve better prediction
accuracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a summary of this part, again,
the unstructured models when you fit in
[SPEAKER_00]: unstructured covariance matrices really
usually under the cross validation two
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario give better prediction accuracies
than when using diagonal covariance
[SPEAKER_00]: matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also using these types of matrices are
beneficial when we try to predict untested
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this is also true because in the
case of the unstructured covariant matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: the correlations or covariances between
environments were very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these reasons, those high
correlations really improve our prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracies with these types of matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this basically responds to the stable
weather conditions and why where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no major weather events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, I mean, weather is stable,
there's still variation, but there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: big variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using again, using GBAE models that
account for GBAE and that account for
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations between environments can be
beneficial to predict these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is another study where we also
use GBAE models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here what we wanted to do was to feed
our models with weather data to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: model our environments in a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objectives here were to explore
different ways to include this weather
[SPEAKER_00]: covariance in our model, because the
problem that we have when we use weather
[SPEAKER_00]: covariates can be similar than when we use
molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather covariates can be too many and
they can be correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be highly correlated between each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not easy to fit these types of
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another objective was to try to
study the genetic basis of GBAE in our own
[SPEAKER_00]: geoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental covariates we used
where they were retrieved from the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: station in the rice breeding program,
like right where the lines were evaluated
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they consisted of either temperature,
solar radiation, precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were daily measurements for all
these different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we know that these
covariates, they're not going to affect on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way in each state of the growth,
the plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to calculate those covariates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to short those covariates to
different stages so we can model it more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to divide our plants,
sorry, the rice growth into three main
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenological stages,
which were vegetative, reproductive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reproductive is the powering and maturity
is the springing stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is that we didn't have the
information of what time in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were at each stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we used to calculate these stages
was the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know usually the flowering stage
from booting to flowering takes about 35
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on these measurements,
and we know that plants are left in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field after flowering for about 30 days
for grain filling, and knowing the date of
[SPEAKER_00]: planting and the harvesting, we can
calculate this stage for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we calculated our covariates as their
averages over all these stages for both
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tropical Japonica and the Indica
datasets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the datasets we used were the
same as in the previous work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference was that the Tropical
Japonica dataset had two more years of
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation, and the traits used were grain
yield, head rice percentage, chalking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and height, then height, as a control for
a trait that is not controlled by the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to compare two main different
types of statistical models here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have on one side the reaction norm
models that were developed by Diego
[SPEAKER_00]: Harpín, and the PLSR models, which PLSR
stands for partial least square regression
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the reaction norm models,
we tried three different models.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that only models the genetic effects
that were modeled using these effects at
[SPEAKER_00]: random.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were modeled using the covariance
matrix between genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a G plus W model that has a
genotype component and an environment
[SPEAKER_00]: component, and the environment component
was modeled using the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: covariance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the matrix of covariance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the matrix of covariance between
the environmental covariance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the G plus W plus GW model adds this
interaction term between genotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and this term is modeled by
using the multiplicative product between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two relationship matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we have the PLSR
models, and basically what PLSR models do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they decompose our data into latent
variables, and these latent variables are
[SPEAKER_00]: linear combinations of our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they try to do is to maximize the
covariance between our response and our
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we try the PLSG model,
which was only using markers as
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors, and the PLSGW model using both
markers and environmental covariance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the results for the,
sorry, I don't know why they don't show up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the results for the
prediction accuracies in both data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in blue, to predict each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're trying to predict new years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bars, the blue bars here represent
the reaction norm model, and the red and
[SPEAKER_00]: orange bars represent the PLS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that for the Indicas,
and also for the Japonicas, but mostly for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indicas, the PLSR models gave better
prediction accuracies or equal prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracies than the reaction norm models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually this orange bar, which
corresponds to the PLS using both
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular markers and environmental
covariance, they usually give a little
[SPEAKER_00]: higher prediction accuracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it here, too, for the
Japonicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, for these data sets,
we obtained better prediction accuracies
[SPEAKER_00]: when using these types of models,
the PLSR models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as I said in the introduction,
we tried to explore the genetic basis of
[SPEAKER_00]: GVAE from our germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we performed a GWAS
for each year, each trait in each
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, yeah, each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we could only find significant
QTLs for head rise and chalkiness in both
[SPEAKER_00]: data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't find any significant QTLs in
any environment for brain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did here, so all these QTLs
have different effects in different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tried to do here was to test
all these QTLs for interaction with our
[SPEAKER_00]: weather covariates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this model that was developed
by Marco Malossetti, which fits a main
[SPEAKER_00]: environment effect, a QTL main effect,
a QTL by environmental covariance,
[SPEAKER_00]: a covariate effect, and then there's a QTL
by environment and the genetic effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are random effects here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could only find significant
interactions for two of our QTLs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica data sets, and where both for head
rise percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weather covariates were mainly
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we tried with all weather
covariates, and the only ones we found
[SPEAKER_00]: significant interaction were with
covariates that were during the maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were weather covariates related
to precipitation and humidity for one QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the other QTL related to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically the similar situation here
in the tropical Japonicas, we found one
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL for head rise percentage show
significant interaction with environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: covariates through maturity to related to
precipitation and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for chalkiness, this QTL showed
interaction with covariates that were
[SPEAKER_00]: related to minimum temperature and
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was unexpected because we know
from previous studies that usually grain
[SPEAKER_00]: chalkiness in the tropics is mainly
affected by high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually the high temperatures in the
tropics, the ones that affect grain
[SPEAKER_00]: chalkiness are those that are higher than
33 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in Uruguay temperatures,
maximum temperatures during grain filling
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, they never reach 33, they're always
lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be possible that for
chalkiness in Uruguay and also maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: other temperate or subtropical areas where
temperatures are not as high as in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics, maybe there's other weather
components that might be affecting this
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be either minimum temperature or
also like solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some physiological studies
within the Uruguayan germplasm that the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders are doing in Uruguay that also
point to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was all about genotype by
environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're moving to a different topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we tried to do was to select,
to explore how to use genomics prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: to the best combinations of parents for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we try to do here was to,
first of all, for the first objective was
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to see how many crosses in common
we have when we select our crosses based
[SPEAKER_00]: only on the mean, which is easily
predicted, and the progeny mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, which is easily predicted by the
mid-parent value, or by using a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of both the mean and the
variance in our progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variance is a little harder to
predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to predict the variance in our
simulated progeny through these
[SPEAKER_00]: simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we try to evaluate different
selection criteria for improving
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively correlated traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually in rice, grain yield,
and milling quality are negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see different ways we can
improve all our traits simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all done during simulations,
but also we have some of the crosses that
[SPEAKER_00]: were simulated here were actually
performed in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to compare our predictive
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cross is the progeny from those
crosses was actually evaluated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field in Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to compare the prediction
accuracies that we had for those crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: with actual field data from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a summary of what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first started from a training
population that consisted of 300 tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: japonica lines, elite breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were planted in Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we firstly performed 19 crosses
between these members of this line,
[SPEAKER_00]: of this training population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought the F1 seed here to Cornell,
and we planted it in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these families were in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we advanced them up to F4,
and then we genotyped everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also performed 185 random crosses
between these 19 families trying to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals from different families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the progeny, the F1 from these crosses
was sent to Luciana for double hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: development, where we could only obtain 43
double hoplites out of 185 F1 seed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these families were then sent to a
wide field evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a description of our
training population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, grain yield and million
quality has to be negatively correlated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wasn't the exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see that grain yield is
negatively correlated with both milling
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and head rice percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also positively correlated with
grain chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we actually want to do is to
reduce chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this positive correlation is
undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make the 19 crosses here between
members of this training population,
[SPEAKER_00]: we performed a cluster analysis here so we
could detect five different groups in this
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to cross individuals between
different groups as a way to preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: original diversity in the training
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tried to cross also
individuals that were good for one trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: good individuals that were good for the
other trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I told you, we made this process in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought the F1 seed here to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted it in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we genotype everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the results from the
simulation for each trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we simulated all the possible
combinations between these 19 families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we calculated the mean and the
variance of each simulated progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see the mean of each
progeny versus the progeny variance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from these progenies, we tried to
select the top 100 individuals that had
[SPEAKER_00]: either the highest mean, which are these
red dots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, the reference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tried to select the top 100
individuals that had both the top 100
[SPEAKER_00]: progenies with the maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, with the maximum mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the top 10% of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a combination of
selecting based on both mean and variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in purple here, we can see the crosses
in common between the two methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are depicted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see that we have more
crosses in common for grain yield than for
[SPEAKER_00]: the other traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe for grain yield, using just the
mean between the parents to predict our
[SPEAKER_00]: best process, maybe that would be a good
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the easiest option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the million quality traits,
we might want to evaluate whether using
[SPEAKER_00]: the mean between the parents or a
combination of the mean and the variance
[SPEAKER_00]: and the progeny would be the best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have so many crosses in
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, this is to show you the
correlated response between the traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: the simulations, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see that usually,
of course, grain yield and milling yield
[SPEAKER_00]: between these 19 families, they have a
negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between grain yield and head rise
percentage, the correlation is not that
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that, too, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the distribution of the
correlations between the traits across all
[SPEAKER_00]: the progenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though this distribution is huge
to the negative side, we can see there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some progenies that still have a positive
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still room for improvement here
in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tried to do here was to
simulate, sorry, to try to evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: different selection schemes to improve
both grain yield and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first three selection schemes we
used, they differed on the selection on
[SPEAKER_00]: which trait we were applying the strongest
selection pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one was firstly, selecting
based on the top 10% lines based on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, selecting based on the
other quality traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one was selecting first for
head rise and then based on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third one was selecting first for
chalkiness, then the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also evaluated a
multiplicative index where we consider all
[SPEAKER_00]: the traits in the tenus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here this x is the value for that
progeny, is the mean for that progeny for
[SPEAKER_00]: that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this k here is the minimum value for
the lowest value or the highest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: case of chalkiness for that trait across
all progenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took the top 25 crosses that were
selected from each selection scheme and we
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated the mean of those progenies,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we subtracted that mean from the,
sorry, we subtracted the mean in the
[SPEAKER_00]: training population, but that's with our
response to selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for selection scheme one,
we see that we had the highest response to
[SPEAKER_00]: selection for grain yield, but the
response to selection for the other medium
[SPEAKER_00]: quality traits was very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, using selection scheme
two, we had a lower response for yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we had a higher response for the other
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the second best scheme was the
multiplicative index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be something to have in mind
in the future when we want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: using these types of indices, when we want
to breed for these traits simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is, so that was with the
simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this part is about the evaluations or
double haploid line families in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as I told you, we only could
recover 43 double haploid families out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 185 F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have the chance to choose
which families to evaluate, which we sent
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and everything was evaluated by
little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we calculated the means for each
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the problem we had here was that
these lines arrived too late to the Y,
[SPEAKER_00]: they arrived on December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were planted late, actually three
months after the regular rice planting
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this reason, we think that grain
yield was so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we compare it here, this is a meaning
for each trait in the training population
[SPEAKER_00]: as a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yield was very low for this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, for milling
quality, for milling yield and head rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: the means for these traits were actually a
little better than the training
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was surprising for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean for grain chalkiness was very low
compared to the training population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unexpected because these lines were
during maturity, they were in maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: during the fall season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperatures can be very low for rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good result because we want to
minimize chalkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the trait correlations between
these families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the correlations are low, but again,
since, I mean, the correlations between
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and the other milling quality traits
are actually non-significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, as our plants, they were
planted late and our yield was so low
[SPEAKER_00]: because weather conditions, we can't take
this very, I mean, we, these plants are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're right now in the field that were
planted again for a new evaluation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're waiting for the data to make more
informed decisions about the results of
[SPEAKER_00]: this part of the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other, so what we try to do was to
compare what prediction accuracy is for
[SPEAKER_00]: these families with the actual data from
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did with, we performed
genomic prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our lines, we had our prediction
accuracies for families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had the evaluation from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran both predictions and the field data
and we compared, we took the top 10% and
[SPEAKER_00]: we compared which ones on the top 10% for
the predictions where it correspond,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also in the top 10% for the field
evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for grain yield, we could only
find one family.
[SPEAKER_00]: This family was in common between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for, but again, since they were
planted late, we need actually like better
[SPEAKER_00]: data to, to examine the role of genomic
selection for grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, four million quality traits,
we found four families out of 10 were in
[SPEAKER_00]: common between the two rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for grain chalkiness, six families out
of 10 were common between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions, sorry, the two rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we are waiting for more data to
analyze from the field, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, this is promising for us because
it could be a great genomic selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good strategy to predict traits in
million quality traits in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was everything about genomic
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a bonus track and I'm gonna go
fast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I told you, we only,
we could only obtain 43 double haploid
[SPEAKER_00]: families, actually a little more,
there were 54 double haploid families out
[SPEAKER_00]: of 185 F1C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our double haploid yield was pretty
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tried to see, what we tried to
do was to explore our germplasm for
[SPEAKER_00]: anthraculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthraculture is the process to obtain
double haploid lines in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to explore our germplasm for
genomic regions associated to
[SPEAKER_00]: anthraculture in our tropical japonica
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mainly, anthraculture consists of two
main steps, which are callous induction
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the two main bottlenecks of
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we know also that the response to
anthraculture is highly dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: donor genotype, and usually indica lines
are the least responsive among all lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical japonica varieties are usually,
are easier usually to regenerate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a big variation on response to
anthraculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our objective was to identify QTLs for
both callous induction and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration in our double haploid lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our data set consisted of 191 lines
that belonged to 54 double haploid
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where all the double haploid
families we caught, we could recover after
[SPEAKER_00]: the anthraculture process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traits were cali transfer per
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a measure of the measurement of
callous induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number of plants regenerated per callous,
which is an idea of, is a measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the number of panicles per each
regenerated plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us an idea of the bigger,
of our plants, because usually plants
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerate, but not usually, but sometimes
plants regenerate, and then we transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the greenhouse and they die,
or they have very low yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the genotyping was done using an
exterior library, and we had a total of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 69,000 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know why it's so bad,
but these are the results for,
[SPEAKER_00]: where G was for callous induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we could identify four QTLs that
were distributed along chromosomes two,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, 11, and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for plants per callous, we could find
a lot more QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a total of 12 QTLs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these QTLs were mainly this
one in chromosome two was also collocated
[SPEAKER_00]: with this one for callous induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these QTLs were also distributed along
chromosomes two, three, five, six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, eight, and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, for panicles per plant,
we found a total of five QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this QTL also collocated with this
second QTL found here for plants per
[SPEAKER_00]: callous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made a literature search to find
which QTLs for these traits were
[SPEAKER_00]: previously reported in other studies,
and we found a total of eight QTLs among
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones we found were previously reported
in other studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these results are exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just identified the QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to go more deeply into fine
mapping and possibly identifying causal
[SPEAKER_00]: genes under these QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about all I wanted to tell you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the acknowledgement part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to first thank my committee.
