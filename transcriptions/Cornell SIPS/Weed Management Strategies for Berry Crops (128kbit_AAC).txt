[SPEAKER_03]: It was very effective on killing weed
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a few growers would use it before
they plant strawberries because it would
[SPEAKER_03]: kill the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't really have that option
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of growers are interested in black
plastic as a way of managing weeds as well
[SPEAKER_03]: and strawberries in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And black plastic works fairly well in the
annual systems where you plant your
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries in the fall after the long
day lengths induce runner rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you plant them in the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't runner anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just go through the fall and get
exposed to short days and cool
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures and induce flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The following spring those flowers open
and they set fruit and fruits harvested
[SPEAKER_03]: early in the spring and then the plants
are ripped out and it's cycle starts all
[SPEAKER_03]: over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the annual system that you would
see in California and Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some growers are trying this black
plastic system up north here in New York
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The challenges with that are that in the
fall when you plant your strawberries
[SPEAKER_03]: oftentimes we don't have a very long
period of cool warm temperatures in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fall for those plants to get established
and initiate flower buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they often don't do so well the
following spring even though it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good way of managing the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black plastic also has a big
environmental impact too and you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really have a good way of getting rid of
the plastic once it's in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second year when the
strawberries do try to produce runners
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no place for those runners to root
because the plastics in the way is you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to either cut them off or rip up the
plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a problem as well and I did some
calculations earlier and strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: growers use enough plastic each year to
circle the earth 13 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of plastic that strawberry
growers are using.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not a real big proponent of black
plastic on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the growers in the northeast use a
matted row and here they plant their
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries in the springtime about 18
inches apart down a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rows are about four feet apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: They plant into a essential site that's
prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real nice seedbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at this field you can see
there's a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of niches for weeds to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of shading.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are small and lots of open
ground for weeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically what happens is growers walk
along and they clip off those first
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers to promote runnering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is the runners then will grow
down the row and root and form a nice mat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence the word matted row.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you can see through all these
pictures there's bare ground throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: much of that first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers irrigate those plants as a runner
to establish but oftentimes with all that
[SPEAKER_03]: bare ground you get a lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a real mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And indeed strawberry growers struggle
endlessly with weeds particularly under
[SPEAKER_03]: the matted row system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people think well you know I
can't have any weeds I have to spend a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of time out there making sure there are
absolutely no weeds in my strawberries and
[SPEAKER_03]: that could be a strategy to take although
that's very labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we wanted to ask a few questions like
how much weed growth is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean can you tolerate some weed growth?
[SPEAKER_03]: If so how long can you have weeds in your
field before you have to get them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed a dead weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there times when weed growth can be
tolerated?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are times when it can't be
tolerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just too competitive with
strawberry plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought before we really start
tackling this whole problem of managing
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds we ought to be able to answer some
of these questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did an experiment and this experiment
was take a planting of strawberries newly
[SPEAKER_03]: planted field and let the weeds grow for
certain periods of time and at certain
[SPEAKER_03]: times during that first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this experiment we had weeds growing
for just a month of June, July,
[SPEAKER_03]: August, September or no weeds at all
throughout the entire year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we had two week periods June and
July, July and August, August September
[SPEAKER_03]: for three month periods and for the entire
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we followed the yield of these
strawberry plants for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's our plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see some plots have weeds some
don't depending on the month of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's our graph of some of our
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here on the left you can see the X's
indicate when weeds are present.
[SPEAKER_03]: This column here is runners and it
indicates how many runners were formed
[SPEAKER_03]: after those weed treatments were present
and then the yield the following year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you can see in this first line is
when you have weeds throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: first year you have very few runners and
very low yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: You back off in weeds your yield goes up a
little bit back off a little bit more your
[SPEAKER_03]: yield goes up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you only have weeds during the month of
June your yields are higher and of course
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of makes intuitive sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing that's really interesting I
think is if you look at weeds in June or
[SPEAKER_03]: June or July or August September and look
at the runners and look at the yield you
[SPEAKER_03]: can see that early season weeds have a
much larger impact on yield and runners
[SPEAKER_03]: negative impact than do late season weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact weeds in September is some small
impact on runner and maybe not much of an
[SPEAKER_03]: impact at all on yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So weeds in the early part of the season
are much more detrimental than weeds at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can look at June and July weeds a
two-month period and look at our yield of
[SPEAKER_03]: a thousand grams per plot and look at
weeds during a two-month period at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the season down here and our yield is
two and a half times as much even though
[SPEAKER_03]: the time of weed pressure was exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do the same thing with three months
of weed pressure early weeds low yield
[SPEAKER_03]: three months of weeds at the end of this
later in the season the yields are much
[SPEAKER_03]: higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty clear to us is those early
season weeds in the strawberry field are
[SPEAKER_03]: the most critical and the ones we have to
deal with the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we also know that we don't have a lot
of herbicides that work very well on
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries so the question is can we use
something else besides herbicides like
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation to remove weeds early in the
season when they're most problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at a bunch of different
cultivation tools to see what impact that
[SPEAKER_03]: would have on the strawberries and on the
weeds in the planting year.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a traditional instrument that's
used to manage weeds as a rototiller or a
[SPEAKER_03]: multivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes through and cultivates the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've all seen this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The disadvantage of a multivator is it's
very hard on soil structure because when
[SPEAKER_03]: those tines come down into the soil it
compacts the soil two or three inches down
[SPEAKER_03]: in the ground and then it also on the
upstroke it brings up new weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though you work the weeds in
you're also bringing new weeds these up
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're working the soil down three
or four inches and it's hard on the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some other tools out there that
some of the vegetable growers use that
[SPEAKER_03]: don't cultivate down so deeply and get
weeds out right between the row.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is a finger weeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it here working on some
upstroke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pulls the weeds out right around the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also these flex tines arrows and
they can be driven right over top of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and these tines vibrate and they
shake out the small weeds as you drive
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly over the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the strawberry plants can be right in
the ground and drive right over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things wiggle back and forth and
vibrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry plants stay intact but any
small weeds get vibrated out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can set those to different tensions
and so forth take out weeds of different
[SPEAKER_03]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Reggie weeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes in the back of a tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sit in the back of it and it has two
rotating discs down here with tines on
[SPEAKER_03]: them that spin the weeds out and the
operator moves arms in and out to go
[SPEAKER_03]: around the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see here these spin like this as you
go around the plant so you can get close
[SPEAKER_03]: to the plant far away from the plant close
and it only cultivates down about an inch
[SPEAKER_03]: or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the nice thing about this instrument is
it does not compact the soil deeply.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't bring up new weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just spins the weeds out from around
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This instrument is a brush hoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a giant street sweeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a couple of gaps in it that
straddle the strawberry plants and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: in this case it's cabbage but you straddle
the rows and it just sweeps the weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: right out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also creates a lot of dust.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dust settles back down on the ground
but that dust acts as a mulch and covers
[SPEAKER_03]: up weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though it only cultivates really
between the rows it also suppresses weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: between the plants as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are used a lot on vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to see how they would work on
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a plant of strawberry where we
use a brush hoe to sweep on either side of
[SPEAKER_03]: the strawberry plants with no cultivation
or anything in between the rows and it
[SPEAKER_03]: does a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is devernal which is a standard
herbicide that would be used after
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see there's weeds coming up there
because devernal is a pre-emergent
[SPEAKER_03]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get all the weeds but it gets
any of them but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So compared to the previous picture where
you use a cultivation tool the herbicide
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't work quite as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a flex tine harrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one that drags over top of
plants and vibrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't pull the plants out of the
ground but it shakes the weeds loose and
[SPEAKER_03]: it looks pretty good early in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: But later in the season we get a lot of
weed seed germination with this flex tine
[SPEAKER_03]: harrow because it doesn't bury the weed
seeds it just sort of stirs them up a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit even though it takes the weeds
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you stop using it then you get a big
flush of weeds and with strawberries when
[SPEAKER_03]: they start to runner you can't use the
flex tine harrow after that because it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: tear the runners out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to stop and you get this big
flush of weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by the end of the season our flex tine
harrow plots are fairly weedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again this is a brush hoe after we've gone
through early in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: No herbicides just a brush hoe and this is
a brush hoe later in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unlike the flex tine harrow which gave
us a big flush of weeds same plot same
[SPEAKER_03]: year the brush hoe kept the weeds at bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: These cultivation tools these flex tine
harrow seems to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the flex tine harrow had lots of
weeds in the row and between the row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brush hoe had very few weeds in the row
and between the row.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like a pretty promising
implement the herbicide gave us quite a
[SPEAKER_03]: few weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we weren't quite as excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at yields it's interesting
where we used a multivator which is the
[SPEAKER_03]: standard implement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our yields were you know kind of on the
low side.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flex tine harrow where we kept the
weeds out early but we had a stop later on
[SPEAKER_03]: actually the yields are pretty good even
though they were pretty weedy at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again I think that ties in with what we
talked about earlier that early season
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds if you get those out of there that's
a you do a pretty good job of having your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants healthy going into the year and the
yields are pretty high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeds later on don't matter so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plots had weeds later on but you can
see it didn't matter so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brush hoe, yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin can I interrupt with one question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Miller is wondering if there's any
research on flamers like pros and cons and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I just saw that and I thought I
should ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people have played around with flamers
but the thing you don't want to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: the flamers obviously burn the leaves of
the strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to focus that between the rows
of strawberries and indeed it works as
[SPEAKER_03]: long as you have annual plants or I'm
sorry annual weeds but if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: perennial weeds it doesn't do a very good
job against them because they come right
[SPEAKER_03]: back and I really don't know of anyone who
is using flamers on strawberries in the
[SPEAKER_03]: planting year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have experimented with a
flamer in the fruiting year like after
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest or renovate and clean things up
but they seem to damage the plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: they haven't gotten particularly good
results from using the flamers so I just
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't seen it used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the brush hoe and the finger weeder
were more expensive to use because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a pretty expensive piece of equipment
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're much more effective at controlling
weeds and over the long run the brush hoe
[SPEAKER_03]: is probably cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly cheaper to use labor-wise
than our standard practices because it
[SPEAKER_03]: requires fewer passes, fewer hand weedings
and no herbicide and if I had a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: money and I was a strawberry grower I
think a combination of a brush hoe and a
[SPEAKER_03]: reggie weeder would just be the trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: The brush hoe to sweep the weeds out
between the rows and the reggie weeder to
[SPEAKER_03]: go along the plants down the row.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a reggie weeder at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten a brush hoe but these
implements are quite good because they do
[SPEAKER_03]: control weeds early in the season and they
cultivate very shallowly and the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: really respond to that and seem to grow
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shift thoughts just a little bit to
blueberries although you took this poll
[SPEAKER_03]: but managing weeds and blueberries is
quite a bit easier than it is in
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is because we can
plant perennial rye or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_03]: grass between the rows of blueberries and
our blueberries and then mulch underneath
[SPEAKER_03]: those plants and we can confine any
herbicides to the plants to that mulch row
[SPEAKER_03]: and we don't really need a lot because the
mulch suppresses a lot of that annual
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds and we can just mow the weeds off
between the rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most blueberry growers they keep on top of
the weeds don't really have too many
[SPEAKER_03]: troubles.
[SPEAKER_03]: If things get out of hand they get some
vines in there and some trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with blueberries you also have the
option with some of those woody perennials
[SPEAKER_03]: of going in in early November with some
Roundup and Spot Spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem to hurt the blueberries
too much as long as you're careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberries is not too difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is can we take that
concept of what works well for blueberries
[SPEAKER_03]: and sort of apply that to a crop like
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words can we think about not
doing so much cultivation where we do
[SPEAKER_03]: bring up weed seeds and think of it more
of a system where we plant in undisturbed
[SPEAKER_03]: soil like we do here for blueberries and
use a lot of mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again another blueberry field here with
you know fairly clean grass rows mulch
[SPEAKER_03]: middles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this concept to strawberries and
see if something might work for them as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did here we took various cover
crops and we planted those cover crops in
[SPEAKER_03]: the fall and then go through the winter
and then the following spring we killed
[SPEAKER_03]: the cover crops and we did that from
different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them we had to use Roundup to kill
the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others we could just mow them and they
would die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And others we sprayed Paraquat on them
because they were annual and once you
[SPEAKER_03]: killed them they wouldn't come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had these essentially these dead
cover crops in the spring and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivated narrow strips on these cover
crops and then we planted narrow strips
[SPEAKER_03]: and we didn't disturb the area in between
the rows up weed seeds and wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: suppress weed seed germination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing we did here in the rows is
we also came in with some mulch between
[SPEAKER_03]: the rows and we planted the strawberries
at a fairly close density because given
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that there's undisturbed soil
around here the runners would have a hard
[SPEAKER_03]: time rooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of asking the plant to make a
lot of runners we just planted the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: closer together figuring it's cheaper to
buy a few more plants than it is to spend
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of money weeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to see how that would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to show you data but I'm
going to show you pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are some strawberry plants
planted through a rye cover crop that was
[SPEAKER_03]: killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The strawberries were planted fairly close
spacing in a narrow strip and then we came
[SPEAKER_03]: in with a little bit of straw mulch and
put over top of that killed rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was rye plus there was a little
bit of rye straw added to give a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in a really weedy field A lot of
nutsedge and those of you who are familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with nutsedge know that it's just a
terrible weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very aggressive and it pushes up
through plastic and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you see where the arrows are here
these plots had no herbicide and all they
[SPEAKER_03]: had was killed rye with straw mulch over
top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants were at a relatively high
density and they did extremely well at
[SPEAKER_03]: least in terms of keeping the weeds down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this system here I think has some
promise especially on lighter soils where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get in and get those strawberries
into the ground at a higher density.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to show you this is a row,
a conventional planting that we use
[SPEAKER_03]: herbicides and everything like that on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is with the mulches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the weeds are pretty good in both
cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these high density plantings with the
sod mulch work I think pretty well or at
[SPEAKER_03]: least equivalent to what the standard way
of growing strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can apply that same principle to
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some good data to show that
raspberries really thrive in the straw
[SPEAKER_03]: mulch in the planting year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the subsequent years but in the
planting year raspberries like to be
[SPEAKER_03]: surrounded by mulch just like I showed you
for those strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be a typical way we might
recommend growers plant raspberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three feet apart down a row with
trickle irrigation and straw mulch around
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants because I love that straw
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin can I interrupt too just quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another question about using oats
as a cover crop and whether or not you
[SPEAKER_00]: could also use a roller crimper on the rye
and maybe you will be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I'll try to get to both of those
questions in the next couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't tried crimping the rye but
we have treated it with paraquat or
[SPEAKER_03]: Roundup because that way we pick up a few
extra weeds along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you probably could crimp the
rye as long as you're doing it at the
[SPEAKER_03]: right stage where it kills it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did in this experiment was we
wanted to see if we could grow the mulch
[SPEAKER_03]: in place when we planted the raspberries
so that we wouldn't have to bring the
[SPEAKER_03]: straw in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a plot so you can see some of
these plots here where we had you know
[SPEAKER_03]: bare ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bare ground and we had rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we planted the raspberries down the
rows here to see how they would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here the little raspberry plants grow
between that killed rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we followed them for a couple of
years and it's interesting this photo here
[SPEAKER_03]: was taken two years after the rye was
planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are the control plots where we
had that bare ground and here are the
[SPEAKER_03]: plots where we had the rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though everything was treated
exactly the same in those two plots you
[SPEAKER_03]: can see big differences between where we
had the rye here and where we didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: the rye here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that planting through that rye residue
had a really big impact on the
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: No difference in yield but the weed
pressure was certainly greater where we
[SPEAKER_03]: did not use the rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was I thought pretty dramatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now back to Jeff's question about the
could you also use some sort of a oat
[SPEAKER_03]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now oats die in the winter time so if you
plant rye or if you plant oats in the
[SPEAKER_03]: winter or I'm sorry in the fall and let
them go through the winter by the time
[SPEAKER_03]: spring comes around there's not a lot of
residue there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could plant through it but it's not a
lot of residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it would be enough to
really suppress weeds whereas rye gives
[SPEAKER_03]: you more residue and is a little apathetic
and suppresses weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have done with oats and what we
have done with Sudan grass is after
[SPEAKER_03]: renovating strawberries we've gone in and
just broadcast the seed over top of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of going through and having
bare soil from say August through October
[SPEAKER_03]: again more opportunities for weeds to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea was why not sow a seed in there
of at least a plant that we know is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to die in the winter time and not going to
go to seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we broadcast the oats we broadcast the
Sudan grass they grow they displace the
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds that normally would grow and then
they die in the winter and leave us with a
[SPEAKER_03]: residue between the strawberry plants but
no weeds and it looks pretty trashy in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fall when you do that after the frost
comes but it does a pretty good job of
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping the weeds out as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are some of the approaches we've
used to trying to manage weeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries and this is the strawberry
field in the spring after we grew the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sudan grass between the rows of
strawberries and it looks pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's some sort of new ways we're
thinking about managing weeds without
[SPEAKER_03]: relying on herbicides all the time using
cover crops to reduce weed pressure before
[SPEAKER_03]: planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Focus our attention early in the season if
you have limited time focus it early
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than late some options are planning
through killed sods using shallow
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation tools and in inter planting
cover crops and that may hold some promise
[SPEAKER_03]: as opposed to going in there with sin bar
something like that after renovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that Laura I think we're done with
the formal presentation and maybe we can
[SPEAKER_03]: go and look at some of the responses to
the poll or answer some questions and Jeff
[SPEAKER_03]: asks what's the timing of sowing the oats
and Sudan grass?
[SPEAKER_03]: We plant or seed that right at renovation
so that would be probably early August
[SPEAKER_03]: after the you go through with the
rototiller and narrow up the rows the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves are mowed off you narrow up the
rows then you can seed your oats and Sudan
[SPEAKER_03]: grass then.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a really hot warm summer late at
the end of the season the Sudan grass can
[SPEAKER_03]: grow pretty tall so when we've done that
we've had pretty good results just to go
[SPEAKER_03]: in with like a sickle bar something and
mow that Sudan grass back down to say a
[SPEAKER_03]: foot high if it exceeds the strawberry
plants by too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words it'll shade the strawberry
plants out if it gets too tall so we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: let it get too tall but if we just go in
and mow it that's a good way of setting it
[SPEAKER_03]: back again and having it sort of start
over again and still provide that biomass
[SPEAKER_03]: that we want later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right does anybody else have any
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's your chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay maybe we can look at the results of
the poll try to find the one that we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just start with this one and this is the
results there hopefully you're seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: results and
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of this broadcast results and
what type of new herbicide would be most
[SPEAKER_00]: useful with the strawberry growers and I
don't know if you want to comment at all
[SPEAKER_00]: on that Marvin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that I would agree that post
emergent broadleaf is probably most
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable it's not too difficult to kill
grass and strawberries because grass is a
[SPEAKER_03]: monocot and it's a grass and you can find
selective herbicides against grasses that
[SPEAKER_03]: leave the strawberries alone but where you
have real difficulty are broadleaf weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: within a broadleaf plant most of the
broadleaf herbicides that are out there
[SPEAKER_03]: affect strawberries as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the few that doesn't is 2,4-D
surprisingly 2,4-D will impact most other
[SPEAKER_03]: broadleaf plants and leave strawberries
alone it's very old herbicide growers have
[SPEAKER_03]: used it for years and still really quite a
good herbicide to use on strawberries
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly at renovation time and again
in early November when it's still a little
[SPEAKER_03]: warm and the dandelions and plants like
that can take it up yeah anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: works on broadleaf plants that selectively
leave strawberries alone would be a good
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right when I as I switch these poll
things there's a couple of other questions
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin one from Jeff Miller about can
cover crops be a host of pests of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries and then Jan Eglinger has a
question as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so cover crops can be hosts of pests
but if you select a cover crop that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: closely related to the crop then the odds
of sharing pests diminish considerably and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why most of the cover crops that
we've talked about are grass type crops in
[SPEAKER_03]: the grass family so Sudan grass it doesn't
really share any pests of strawberries in
[SPEAKER_03]: fact it helps suppress nematodes,
rye, oats those things they do not share
[SPEAKER_03]: pests of strawberries so they're very safe
to use whereas if we would be using say
[SPEAKER_03]: like a legume cover crop like clover or
peas they do harbor lots of diseases in
[SPEAKER_03]: common with strawberries because they're
much more closely related verticillium,
[SPEAKER_03]: wilt, tarnished plant bug things like that
so stick with the grasses and you'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: much safer and in terms of fact sheets we
have good information in the production
[SPEAKER_03]: guides the strawberry production guide the
blueberry guide the raspberry guide they
[SPEAKER_03]: all have a chapter in there a section on
cover crops that are appropriate to use in
[SPEAKER_03]: the various berry crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What percent of non-harvest labor
expenditures do you believe growers spend
[SPEAKER_00]: on weed management and
[SPEAKER_03]: we've done various economic analyses and
in fact last two weeks I've taken my class
[SPEAKER_03]: on field trips to strawberry farms and
we've asked the growers that question
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically and they all say about 80%
and our numbers when we look at it the
[SPEAKER_03]: economics it looks like it's about 70% so
it's very very high a lot of labor spent
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling weeds and managing weeds and
strawberries in particular that's why
[SPEAKER_03]: we're focusing so many of our efforts on
strawberries okay
[SPEAKER_00]: let's look at these polls about how
effective the current suite of herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries raspberries and blueberries
and let me just make sure that they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast the results of all of these as
we look at them and I would you know
[SPEAKER_03]: concur with these results at least that's
how I would expect them to come out even
[SPEAKER_03]: if you hold a bunch of growers that you
know strawberry herbicides are moderately
[SPEAKER_03]: effective there are more now than there
were just a few years ago same with
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberries moderately effective none are
super effective but blueberries you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a few that are you know fairly
effective on blueberries because you have
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant that's up hired has woody stems
shoots so it gives us a lot more options
[SPEAKER_03]: for spraying a little bit more harsher
product down on the ground and not
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the plant all right and for our
final question this was actually the first
[SPEAKER_03]: question broadcast those results and again
I think people's perception is right you
[SPEAKER_03]: know strawberry growers struggle the most
with weeds compared to the other two and I
[SPEAKER_03]: see a few questions down here that we can
maybe answer about cover crops the Sarah
[SPEAKER_03]: managing cover crops book is a good
resource and it sure is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: information from the Sarah guide we've
picked out cover crops that would be in
[SPEAKER_03]: that Sarah book for the production guide
because certain ones don't do well like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's in the Sarah book like some of the
legumes but in a blueberry field where you
[SPEAKER_03]: have an acidic soil the legumes don't grow
well in acidic soil so those would be
[SPEAKER_03]: excluded even though they might be good
cover crops otherwise so if you look in a
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry production guide it won't talk
about leguminous cover crop because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just not compatible with acidic soil and
the question that Dean asked can buckwheat
[SPEAKER_03]: be used as a lake cover at renovation or
the pest concerns the problem what we've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen with buckwheat is that it throws a
good bit of shade and it also goes to seed
[SPEAKER_03]: and the and you might have to kill it or
cultivate it before it goes to seed
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas the oats and the Sudan grass we
don't have to worry about that we let that
[SPEAKER_03]: frost take care of it for us and we can
just leave it in place if you would use
[SPEAKER_03]: buckwheat in between the rows you'd have
to manage a little bit more carefully
[SPEAKER_03]: because you wouldn't want it to turn into
a weed for you the following year I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: sure about pest concerns buckwheat I don't
think there would be pest concerns
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly you know when it's flowering
it's flowering after strong strawberries
[SPEAKER_03]: flower so even if it would attract carnage
plant bugs or something like that it would
[SPEAKER_03]: be past the point at which strawberries
are vulnerable then I see Jeff as I was
[SPEAKER_03]: asking about sap beetle I'm not sure what
context but sap beetles do overwinter in
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry can't overwinter in strawberry
fields if there's a lot of junk around so
[SPEAKER_03]: there could be an issue I suppose if you
had a lot of residue it can make an
[SPEAKER_03]: environment a little bit more favorable
for the sap beetle to overwinter in so
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of leaving the field into the
woods and all it might just hang around
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a good question I don't know the
answer that I haven't had anybody say or
[SPEAKER_03]: observe any growers say you know I've been
mulching more and I've been using these
[SPEAKER_03]: interplanet cover crops and I just noticed
my sap beetle increasing dramatically I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't heard that but I think
theoretically it's possible
[SPEAKER_00]: all right does anybody else have any
questions for Marvin do want to let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that we have another webcast training
on October 8th at one o'clock again it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be the same format but a different topic I
believe that one is with dr. Courtney
[SPEAKER_00]: Weber about new small fruit varieties and
I I am hopeful that I'm going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to email you folks a couple of questions
just about the format and whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing went smoothly the whole webcast
went smoothly and if you wanted to make
[SPEAKER_00]: any suggestions please don't hesitate to
email me and I appreciate you thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: very much dr. Pritz for participating and
thanks to the rest of you for joining us
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll see you in two weeks thank you
