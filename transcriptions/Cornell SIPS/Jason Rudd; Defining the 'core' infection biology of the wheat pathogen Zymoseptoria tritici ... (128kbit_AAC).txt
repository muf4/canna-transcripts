[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, no, thanks for the invitation to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very nice to meet way back earlier
in the year, Libby, over in Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the presentation I'm going to
give you today is entitled Defining the
[SPEAKER_00]: Core Infection Biology of the Wheat
Pathogen, as I'm a septuorotritici through
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-omics approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a member of Rothamsted Research
that I'll introduce in a moment in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Protecting Crops and the
Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, so in answer to the question
about how old we are, as far as I'm aware,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are one of the world's oldest
agricultural research institutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are based about 20 kilometres north
of London in the United Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were established in about 1843 by the
gentleman in the top left corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture there, Sir John Bennett Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, we've been sort of hosting
some of the longest continuous agronomic
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments that are currently known and a
notable one is one we call on a field
[SPEAKER_00]: called Broadbork, which is a winter wheat
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that experiment has been pretty much
running as long as Rothamsted's been going
[SPEAKER_00]: since about 1844.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ladies you can see on the picture
there have been storing away wheat samples
[SPEAKER_00]: from that particular experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vegetative tissues, root tissues,
soil, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: year on year from that date for us to
analyse at any point in the current time
[SPEAKER_00]: and still going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really just show this slide to
highlight the fact that wheat has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: major focus of Rothamsted's research for a
long, long time, and it continues to be
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the presentation I'm going to give
today, I'm going to start with some key
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the pathogen and the disease
problem introducing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to give you five,
if time permits, mini presentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, mini scientific research
areas that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with looking at pangenomics as a
method to identify core genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: functional analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give an update on some work we've
been doing on characterisation of a core
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence-infected protein from the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll introduce what I call the
fast-forward genetic screen for virulence
[SPEAKER_00]: gene discovery, with a focus currently on
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll touch on what we call the
Abraham Wald essential gene screen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: associated mutant collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, I'll shift tracks a little
bit and talk about some work that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done using this fungus as a tool for the
discovery of new microbe-derived crop
[SPEAKER_00]: protection products.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most important foliar wheat
pathogen of wheat in the UK is
[SPEAKER_00]: Zymoseptoria tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes septoria tritici blotch disease,
which you can see in the picture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with necrotic lesions bearing
asexual sporulation structures waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: rain splashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is currently the number one
disease problem for UK and European wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put that in perspective, current
calculations have suggested that 70% of
[SPEAKER_00]: all fungicides that are applied on arable
land in Europe, in Western Europe in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, are applied principally to
control this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers really do not want this
disease to get into their wheat crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an economic and environmental
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a representative species of the
globally important Othidium ic class of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, really, I think for
today's presentation and for the system as
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole, is it's long been regarded,
long been known to be a rapidly evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen with a highly flexible sexual
reproductive system, very unstable genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots and lots of ways of shuffling the
deck in terms of genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a model system for looking
at pathogen population dynamics well
[SPEAKER_00]: before we ever sequenced any pathogen
genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a model organism for rapidly
evolving species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's haploid in all, but it's sexual
phase, which aids some of the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you'll hear about today that we do
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of control in this pathogen,
obviously due to this rapid evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is poor host resistance,
and wherever new fungicides are applied,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance occurs very, very quickly and
gets fixed and is prevalent in
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there currently is not one single
fungicide on the market if used in
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation is effective against this
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we need are new disease
control targets, and our research focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on how we can identify the weaknesses that
could form those targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to just give you our overall research
objectives and our methods, basically we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to understand, or we're trying to
understand the genes and pathways which
[SPEAKER_00]: enable leaf infection, but also more
recently we've been starting to look into
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential genes and pathways that
might be essential for life because these
[SPEAKER_00]: are also potentially useful targets for
disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore we focus on things that we
think will hopefully prove useful in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid, near, or long-term for future disease
control interventions, whatever they may
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of methods we use are comparative
genomics and bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use functional genomics and
transformation so we can make knockouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can overexpress genes, and we can very
quickly and easily generate random mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: libraries, and I'll show you some of that
data later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole genome sequencing is now very
affordable, so we can use that to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations and to look at the variation in
pathogen populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: between strains for pangenomics,
and then we obviously conduct infection
[SPEAKER_00]: assays, do microscopy, conduct biochemical
characterization, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the key things that we've been
exploiting in our research is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual characteristic of this particular
fungus in that it's classified as being
[SPEAKER_00]: dimorphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in certain growth conditions,
this particular fungus will grow almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast-like colonies, which you can see in
the left-hand side of the slide there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are not directly plant
pathogenic because to become a pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: to infect wheat leaves, these cells must
germinate hyphae to go in through stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: to start colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be triggered also in vitro by
switching those colonies onto low
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or high temperatures on low
nutrient agar, for example water agar
[SPEAKER_00]: there, which simulates effectively what
happens on the leaf surface and those
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast-like spores start to germinate
hyphae, which enable the fungus to
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate the stomata and begin the early
phases of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very simple laboratory assay,
which forms a very good basis for a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic screen to identify core virulence
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if your particular mutant of
this particular fungus gets locked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast-like state and cannot transition
into the hyphal growth state, you've
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty got a good chance that it's not
gonna be pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: on wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting into virulence genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to reinforce that and make it very,
very obvious and clear is that what this
[SPEAKER_00]: also enables is gives you great power for
looking at genetics and genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereby if you look at a single standard
agar plate for xymoseptoria tritici,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have hundreds to a thousand
genotypes, whether they're natural
[SPEAKER_00]: populations or induced mutants,
whereas a similar plate for most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi that you might be aware of,
you'll have a single genotype colonizing
[SPEAKER_00]: an entire plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really does bulk up the power you
have for doing functional genomics types
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis on this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other important feature was that
obviously we've had fully sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to work on this one, which is one
of the globally accepted reference strains
[SPEAKER_00]: of this pathogen and it's called IPO323.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the fully finished genome
of IPO323, which was done, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: some time ago now by the JGI over in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was at the time, it was the first
complete finished genome for any fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a scoop really for what was then
called mycospheralograminicola before it
[SPEAKER_00]: now became more recently, xymoseptoria
tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there all the, in the red
bars, all the different genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted and where they are on those
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see for this particular iso,
we have 21 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now an interesting feature and slightly
confusing feature of this organism is that
[SPEAKER_00]: those small chromosomes 14 to 21 can be
lost and gained in natural populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also be lost in experiments
as I frequently find, which drives me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start an experiment with IPO323
with 21 chromosomes and you can finish
[SPEAKER_00]: your experiment even though you're not
trying to affect the chromosomes with 20
[SPEAKER_00]: or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are highly unstable and therefore
they're likely to be dispensable for
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence because natural wheat infecting
strains of this fungus can lack any number
[SPEAKER_00]: of those small chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important feature, which is a
bugbear of mine and what I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into going forward is that typical of
most filamentous fungi, actually typical
[SPEAKER_00]: of most eukaryotes, if you like,
is that still 40% of the coding genes
[SPEAKER_00]: present in genomes are of unknown
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the sort of things that are
predicted hypothetical proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins with domain of unknown functions,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of stuff we don't
understand about fungal genomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably eukaryotic genomes in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I'm trying to
address in future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll hopefully show you how we plan to
do that going forward throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other key aspect of the work we do
is to look at the virulence assays of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus on wheat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of the better experiments we
ever did way back in the day where we set
[SPEAKER_00]: up an attached leaf infection assay,
which you can see here is where we put
[SPEAKER_00]: spores on the surface of a wheat leaf and
we can photograph it every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's from day 14 to day 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is this very long
period of symptomless colonization at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start where you're not actually sure
whether you put the fungus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's not going to happen at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then typically around about 10,
11, 12, 13 days, you start to see some
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration and collapse of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 14 day onwards, you've seen that
very same area where you applied the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores on completely collapse and become
necrotic and dry and bear those pycnidia,
[SPEAKER_00]: those fungal sporulation structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we set this up, obviously,
it allows us to do many, many different
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative measurements for
aggressiveness of strains for host
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also to test induced mutants of
zymoseptoria that we make in the lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: any loss of virulence or reduction in
virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can score that by any change in the
time taken to disease symptoms or any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the leaf area where we
inoculate the actually established
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we can measure the levels of
fungal sporulation in the tissue simply by
[SPEAKER_00]: washing spores from the tissue or by qPCR
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very quantitative assay that again
forms a basis of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now I'm going to touch on one of the
first mini scientific areas that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is unpublished data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, it is published data,
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other stuff is unpublished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is exploiting pathogen pangenomics
to prioritize core genes for functional
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether or not you're aware of
pangenomes, but everybody now is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to generate pangenomes for whatever
species they are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically, biologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a pangenome in summary is the sum of
all genes that you might expect to see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire species, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each individual will have a core set of
genes, but then each individual will
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute its own unique set of genes to
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sequence enough individuals,
you will start to reduce the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: core, if you like, a set of genes that are
present and functional in the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will also start to uncover some of
the genetic variation, which we term
[SPEAKER_00]: accessory genes, that potentially allow
the selective interactions of pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, with changing environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the larger the size of that accessory
or unique fraction is, the greater
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptability of the species is thought to
have to change to environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought about this in a different
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I really wanted to do,
and you realize that xymoseptora is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be super diverse, and it's going to try
and shuffle the deck as often as it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But surely there will be stuff in there
that it can't shuffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea for us was to try and define
and to harden down on what is the core
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the likely gene set that are
indispensable for the lifestyle of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals of this pathogen, because we
thought within there, there could be some
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting new potential targets for
future disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a little panel on genome
analysis, not as big as some others have
[SPEAKER_00]: done, but a very focused and targeted one,
which we started with reannotating the
[SPEAKER_00]: IPO323 genome, which needed a little bit
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took genome sequences of 17
other European isolates that we collected
[SPEAKER_00]: as far west as Ireland and as far east as
Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pathotype them all on weak genotypes
and selected very aggressive strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also did RNA sequencing on
those strains, the majority of those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains as well, including in culture and
during infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And effectively, we built a pan genome,
which was about just short of 18,000 genes
[SPEAKER_00]: from all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we assigned them as either core
or accessory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the core genes we assigned as being so
due to being present in all isolates with
[SPEAKER_00]: no loss of function mutations in any of
the isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all expressed by all of the
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have any particular strains
where a gene was present, but had no
[SPEAKER_00]: expression support.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the contrary, something was deemed
accessory if it was missing from one or
[SPEAKER_00]: more isolates, had a loss of function
mutation in one or more isolates or had no
[SPEAKER_00]: expression in one or more isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key point about this is that you
can see the size of the accessory
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome is almost as large as the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this fits well with other pan genome
studies done on this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, reinforces the fact that this
is a species that is capable of rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large accessory gene set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have started to then drill into the
core genes, which was our initial
[SPEAKER_00]: objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we started to do was start to
do something which was perhaps a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit crazy and simple at the time,
but it's kind of worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to start to look at variation,
chromosome by chromosome in terms of gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: gene variation expressed as chromosome by
chromosome and gene variation expressed as
[SPEAKER_00]: genes to compare and contrast firstly,
core and accessible chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also all genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this by looking at the mutations
we had in each newly sequenced genome
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the IPO323 template and did a
simple SNPF mutation calling, which gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you three outputs for every gene and every
mutation in whether it conferred whether
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a low effect, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA sequence changes, but the amino
acid stays the same, whether there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate effect on the protein DNA
sequence changes, which changes the amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, or whether there is a high effect or
the DNA sequence change results in a loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of function mutations, which is a
premature stop code on a frame shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just thought we'd have a look what
this looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at it on average chromosome
level data was very, very clear in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you looked at all combined different
types of mutations, high, moderate and low
[SPEAKER_00]: per gene averaged over the chromosomes,
which is the top graph there, you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, there was a little bit more
variation in the accessory chromosomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the core, but not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you removed the low effect
mutations, which don't induce amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, you started to see the blue bars
in the second graph down be much higher in
[SPEAKER_00]: the accessory chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the core chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you remove the moderate
effect mutations and go down to the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: bars, you can see that pretty much the
percentage of genes with high effect
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations on those accessory chromosomes
are way, way higher than the average
[SPEAKER_00]: number present on the core chromosomes,
one to 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a mirror image when you look
at the gene expression of every gene
[SPEAKER_00]: averaged out on those chromosomes,
whereby those small chromosomes hardly
[SPEAKER_00]: express at all relative to the average
expression on genes on the core
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a clear compartmentalization,
which we'd suspected and had been
[SPEAKER_00]: partially reported before, but a clear
compartmentalization of the function and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the core and accessory
chromosomes of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started to look at the individual
genes, thinking whether we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: start to select genes for analysis based
on the fact that they might have lower
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations than expected, meaning the
fungus is not really shuffling the deck in
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to test this out, initially,
we started doing some data mining on all
[SPEAKER_00]: the published genes that were available
for xymoseptory, including our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we divided them into three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at all the genes that were
experimentally shown and published not to
[SPEAKER_00]: be required for virulence, those that have
been required for virulence, and also we
[SPEAKER_00]: defined by all pathology the predicted
essential for life genes that are known
[SPEAKER_00]: from Aspergillus fumigatus and drew them
across to xymoseptoria tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at the protein level
polymorphism in terms of moderate SNPs
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can find in each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a very simple result here is
that those genes that are not required for
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence had higher levels of
polymorphism in the population than those
[SPEAKER_00]: that were required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or those that were predicted to be
essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gave us a sort of idea is that can
we use natural protein sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphism to prioritize genes for
functional analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we actually identify some important
new genes by looking for low levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to test this in the lab, we had a tDNA
fungal mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generated this by random tDNA
mutagenesis some years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called 2310.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the 10th colony picked from
experiment 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basis of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And way back we knew that this particular
mutant, although it could grow perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: well on rich agar, and it could generate
hyphae, sorry, it could not generate
[SPEAKER_00]: hyphae on poor nutrient agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was severely impaired in virulence
on wheat relative to the wild type,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see on the left side of the
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a whole genome re-sequence of
this particular strain, and we identified
[SPEAKER_00]: a 13 kilobase tDNA associated deletion,
which effectively removed five genes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome of this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those genes are shown there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potential CYP51, Cytogrom P450,
a methyl transferase transcription factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nucleoside diphosphate kinase,
and a glycosyl hydride.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all gone in the 2310 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we started to look at the
pangenome mutation rates amongst those
[SPEAKER_00]: five genes in our mini population,
we started to see quite clearly that gene
[SPEAKER_00]: four, which is the NDK, had far less
sequence polymorphism between strains than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other genes present in that cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversely, it was the most expressed
gene on average of all the genes in that
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went, does this mean anything in
terms of if we start to reintroduce those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes one by one into the 2310 mutant,
can we actually restore virulence by
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroducing any one of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So each gene was reintroduced with its own
promoter back into the 2310 mutant by
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very nicely for us, I suppose,
is that reintroduction of gene four,
[SPEAKER_00]: the NDK, the nucleoside diphosphate
kinase, was sufficient to restore full
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence to the 2310 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also restore the hyphal growth defect
seen on water agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of nice, and it supports
our idea that we're currently running
[SPEAKER_00]: with, that we can use pangenomics as a
useful predictive tool for gene functional
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the elements that we're
currently using this in that I'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to later is to see whether we can
really get into core genes with current
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown function that have low levels of
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on to a second little mini
topic, which follows on from the pangenome
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, tell you a little bit about the
identification and characterization of a
[SPEAKER_00]: core secreted virulence effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project started some years ago,
but we've updated it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, and I think it's potentially
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was one secreted, a gene encoding
a secreted protein with the lysem domains
[SPEAKER_00]: that is consistently and very repetitive
reproducibly strongly expressed during
[SPEAKER_00]: infection by all strains of zymosectoria
tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see on the right side of the
screen there is what I call a wagon wheel
[SPEAKER_00]: plot of relative gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the very outer rim, the numbers
represent the different strains we've
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pluses say that it was present and
functional in all of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the C6 and 9 are the expression
data for growing in culture, growing at
[SPEAKER_00]: six days during plant infection and nine
days of plant infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular lysem secreted protein
was very, very consistently and nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the same way by all strains
as a core gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we called this some years ago,
ZT3 lysem, because when you actually look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the protein structure, it has a signal
peptide for secretion, and then it has
[SPEAKER_00]: three lysem domains, which are potential
carbohydrate binding domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the only main, those are the
only real features of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago in collaboration with
Bartoma, we characterized that protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that it is actually a chitin
binding protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chitin being one of the major
constituents of the fungal cell wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also a PAMP in terms of plant
defense response induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ZT3 lysem binds very specifically
chitin and not other complex
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also showed some time ago that if
you introduce it into a chitin
[SPEAKER_00]: elicitation, I say the protein that it
will dampen down the elicitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a well-known chitin binding
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you knock it out in the fungus,
we also saw really quite significant
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in virulence, which you can see
in terms of the infection process,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of green tissue that's left at 21
days post infection and also the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass that accumulates in that infected
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've long known it was quite a major
virulence factor for wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some other work on this,
which I'm not showing today, but basically
[SPEAKER_00]: we showed that if you were to silence the
putative wheat chitin receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are called CIRC1 and CBIP,
then the ZT3 lysem mutant could infect
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a clear gene for gene
relationship between one single effector
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the pathogen and some cognate
receptors for chitin that were present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this also told us that basically
the success or failure to induce disease
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty much a straight battle between
wheat and fungal chitin binding proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: in this system, which again is something
that is potentially tractable in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've since gone on to do is ask a
little bit more fundamental questions in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of lysem effector proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was work done by, I think you
would say graduate student or say PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: student.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did some work looking at the orthologs
of lysem effectors throughout the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are basically lysem domain
containing proteins with signal peptides
[SPEAKER_00]: for secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're likely to be secreted out of
fungal cells for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can actually find them in fungi
with various different lifestyles,
[SPEAKER_00]: including saprophytes, endophytes,
obviously pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find them in both the
basidiomycetes and ascomycetes and even in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the early lineages of fungi and in
different types of numbers basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the key questions, there's been
many reports on the importance of lysem
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors in plant pathogen interactions
and even plant endophytic interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one question we had is whether or not
they could be functionally interchangeable
[SPEAKER_00]: between species, particularly if they kind
of structurally look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let her go and pick some lysem
effectors from her analysis that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: do some functional work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as she also picked the
cladosporium fulvum ECP6 protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the first lysem effector
identified in any plant pathogen from
[SPEAKER_00]: cladosporium fulvum by Bart Omer and
colleagues some years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we had to include in the project
because it's very structurally similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ZT3 lysem if you do alpha fold
predictions, et cetera, which you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: boxed up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also let her pick out some
other lysem effectors with different
[SPEAKER_00]: structures and from different species,
including some from G graminis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is guanomyces graminis, which is a
root infecting wheat pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she picked a couple from there and a
couple of other species from literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of other candidate effectors from
other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we basically decided to try and
test whether there's any evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: putative lysem effectors could be
functionally interchangeable between
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this by effectively taking all
of those candidate effectors, hooking them
[SPEAKER_00]: up behind the 3-lysem promoter with a
3-lysem terminator behind them and
[SPEAKER_00]: transforming them back into the ZT3 lysem
mutant, and then testing whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: they regained any virulence on wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a nutshell, this is where we are
with this work, is that only the 3-lysem
[SPEAKER_00]: protein when reintroduced into
zymosceptorotriticide lysem mutant can
[SPEAKER_00]: restore for virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intriguingly, ECP6 from Cardosporium
fulvum, despite looking structurally very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar, cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither can any of the other tested
lysem effectors thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a little bit more work to do
this on this, but it starts to suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that there might be specialization in
lysem effectors in plant pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, perhaps to deal with the
different types of chitin structures that
[SPEAKER_00]: are made during those interactions or the
way chitin is bound during those
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not so easy as just moving them
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've clearly evolved specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now we're going to move on to the next
little mini-topic, which is a fast-forward
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic screen that we've been running for
virulence gene discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try and tell you why I think it's
fast-forwards, initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the very simple and easy ways we
can generate large collections of mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: in zymosceptorotriticide is to zap them by
UV light in a transilluminator,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this generates a lot of phenotypic
diversity quickly and cheaply without any
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see two examples here of
the sort of diversity you can really get
[SPEAKER_00]: just from UV light-exposing IPO323.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, there are lots of
pigmentation mutants, where you have dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: pink, white albino mutants coming through,
very simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right, you can see the sort of
variation you can get in hyphal growth
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start spotting these different
mutants out on water agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really simple, really cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to build up huge mutant
collections very quickly and, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good basis for establishing forward
genetic screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fast-forward genetic screen that
we've adapted thus far uses this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, basically, where we UV
mutagenize our standard sequenced strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we select for whatever particular
phenotype of interest it may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: either strains that cannot transition into
hyphae from yeast-like cells or directly
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants, although that takes a little
bit longer, as you might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever we get a mutant of interest,
we do whole genome re-sequencing and SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: indel analysis, because it's very
cost-effective, about 80 UK pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this at the moment, to see what
genes we have mutated, whether there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting genes in there that come out
of multiple strains, that become strong
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates, and then we start to
investigate them in the lab via an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent knockout or a complementation
and repeat the phenotypic check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first way we adapted the screen
was to see if we could form a hypothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: around whether fungal cell wall mutants
would be affected in virulence on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we did this was basically
because when you look around the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature for plant-infecting fungi,
there are remarkably few models and model
[SPEAKER_00]: systems anyway, actually, for fungal cell
wall study, outside of looking at classic
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three major species are Candida,
Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus fumigatus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are all opportunistic animal
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are either Ascomycetes or
Basidiomycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, there isn't still,
I think, an intensively studied cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: model for any plant-infecting fungi,
and I thought it would be kind of nice if
[SPEAKER_00]: we could try to establish Zynoceptoria
tritici in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a first step towards this,
we obviously needed to generate a
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of mutants in cell wall
strength and viability to see what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this using literally a very
simple assay that was developed many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many years ago for yeasts, which is to
test sensitivity of induced mutant strains
[SPEAKER_00]: to the stained calcifluor white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calcifluor white has been used in yeast
and in fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a screening tool to identify cell wall
mutants on the basis of that, if a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular mutant strain has a defect in
its cell wall strength, it cannot grow
[SPEAKER_00]: back on calcifluor white, despite being
able to grow back on media, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: without calcifluor white, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a powerful screen, well known in
literature, and I thought we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to adapt it to Zynoceptoria tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we did, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classical yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeast replica plating screen, which we've
used for the yeast cells of Zynoceptoria
[SPEAKER_00]: tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a UV treatment of the single
cells to a 95% kill rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them grow up a little bit on a
plate, and then we print them onto black
[SPEAKER_00]: velvet, if you like, which makes a little
imprint, a marker of what was growing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then onto that black velvet plate,
you print your control plate and your test
[SPEAKER_00]: plate, which has calcifluor white in it in
this particular case, and you grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: up, and then effectively you look for
colonies that grow back on the agar that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have calcifluor white, which don't
grow back on the agar that do have
[SPEAKER_00]: calcifluor white, and you pick the former
colony and analyze it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this very quickly got us to a nice
collection of Zynoceptoria cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, we've got so far about 53 mutant
strains based on hypersensitivity to 200
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per mil calcifluor white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, almost all of
those strains also have a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to hyphal growth on water agar
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly more is that the
majority of them also have a dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in virulence on wheat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is quite a nice way of linking
potential cell wall defects to virulence
[SPEAKER_00]: defects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously the question is,
can you get to the underlying genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are affected in the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was sequence the whole
genome, re-sequencing again, of 39 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those 53 available mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a summary of the types of
mutations and number of mutations we got
[SPEAKER_00]: in those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, of the 39 strains we
re-sequenced, we identified 186 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across those mutants that had high effect
loss of function mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average that just short of five
genes were affected by a high effect loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of function mutation in each mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously got more mutations causing
moderate effects, which are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult, certainly for our analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few thousand in total and an average
of 61 per strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting a lot worse than that
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we did it as a little bit
of a look-see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a question of whether we can
make some sense of the genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by those mutations and whether we
could nail it down to single genes being
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the calcifluor white
hypersensitivity and the plant infection
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, we have been able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a 50% success rate so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we analyze the data, look at all the
data we have in terms of expression data
[SPEAKER_00]: and other data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sets as well for all the candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have been able to validate,
and I just show you here, seven genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: total that are specifically inactivated to
cause cell wall weakness and loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: function, loss of virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give you three examples there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different aspects of cell wall biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manan polymerase generates the actual
physical structure of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: KNR4 is likely a signal transduction
integrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ROGF protein is, again,
a signal transduction protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to write this up as a
pipeline, but the pipeline is very
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptable for screening mutants for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it for calcifluor white,
but you could do it for oxidative stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite a useful and powerful
pipeline, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings me nicely into the Abraham
Wald essential gene screen and mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: collection because it kind of builds on
from the same data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did that re-sequencing of the
UV-induced mutations and looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers that we got, when you actually
think about it, so if we sequenced 39
[SPEAKER_00]: individual mutants, we managed to get 186
genes that were clearly not essential for
[SPEAKER_00]: life because the fungus would not have
grown back and we wouldn't have been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sequence it if they had been essential
for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on typically, you know, 4.95 genes
could be inactivated by high-effect
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the high-effect mutation per strain
using this approach led us to the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: idea to sort of think whether it might be
possible to generate sufficient UV mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that if we re-sequenced them all,
would be allow us to identify genes which
[SPEAKER_00]: could never be mutated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never incurred a high-effect mutation
in the data set, indicating they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: putative essential for life genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very similar to the concept
developed by Abraham Wald, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Abraham Wald survivorship bias screen,
which he employed during World War II to
[SPEAKER_00]: study aircraft that returned successfully
from missions, bomber aircraft,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he looked on the aircraft to see where
they had artillery damage and also where
[SPEAKER_00]: they never had artillery damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the principle being that if something,
if a region of the aircraft never had
[SPEAKER_00]: artillery damage, it probably never made
it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore it was of critical function
for the aircraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically that led to the allies
reinforcing certain areas of those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular aircraft to make them more
resilient to potential artillery fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought whether we could do
something similar for a fungal genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: just pepper it with random induced
mutations and identify the genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps never ever could be mutated so
that we never found them and mutated in
[SPEAKER_00]: viable strains and therefore whether those
genes are likely essential for the life of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually UV mutagenized again our
reference strain of IPO323 and we picked
[SPEAKER_00]: 25,000 colonies into 24 well plates by
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grew them all up until they were saturated
and then we made pools of them for genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made 500 pools of 48 individual
mutants, but we've also got a collection
[SPEAKER_00]: of each and every 25,000 mutant as a
glycerol stock, taking half a minus 80
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer and several half minus 80 freezers
down in our basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did together with an industrial
sponsor, we did sequencing of these pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically the whole idea was to
identify whether or not we could,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we could identify genes in the
genome that had no or fewer than expected
[SPEAKER_00]: higher effect mutations and then to test
and validate some of those predictions in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top here is the global overview of
the data that we got, which was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just data for the high effect
mutation rate relative to the predicted
[SPEAKER_00]: length of the protein or the gene,
as it was expressed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should in general be if there's no
link between mutation rate and gene
[SPEAKER_00]: length, most of the data should fall on
that line of expected mutations per gene
[SPEAKER_00]: length and many does, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are above the line are genes
with higher number of mutation than
[SPEAKER_00]: expected, which grows not of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones that fell below the line are
obviously of extreme interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are genes with lower numbers of
mutations than you would expect given the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the predicted gene and protein
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to break this down
into different categories of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on average the number of,
for all proteins in the IPO 3-2-3 genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the number of high effect
indel mutations and high effect SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we looked at the major facilitator
transporters, which are known to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: redundant in function, enzyme acceptoria,
there's 400 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those had a very high rate of indel
and SNP mutations induced by the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we looked at the known and
predicted essentials and current fungicide
[SPEAKER_00]: target genes, these genes came out with
much lower levels of UV induced mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of our original idea for what we
tried to do seems to have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've gone on since then to do some
experimental validation of these candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: new essential genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we use here is a technology we're
able to do where we swap the gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest with its own promoter,
we effectively replace its own promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: with a promoter we can control under
laboratory conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use the nitrate reductase promoter,
which effectively facilitates growth on
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, sorry, growth on nitrate,
the promoter is on, so switch the gene on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow the strain on more complex
nitrogen media, it switches it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a growth no growth assay,
if you like, for your gene of interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereby you effectively control it by
replacing its native promoter with that
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the data just shows how we
kind of select the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we gather, we identify targeted
promoter replacement strains by having
[SPEAKER_00]: only the single upper band with the green
thing there in a PCR based assay,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas ectopic strains where our
transgene has gone somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the wild type gene is still there,
you end up with the two PCR fragments
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you identify those,
you can start screening them for the on
[SPEAKER_00]: off switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm giving you an example here of two
genes that we have identified so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you the exact details of what
they are due to confidentiality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one is a transcription factor,
and one is involved in the general process
[SPEAKER_00]: of protein ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, starting with the left
panel, when you take these mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have ectopic mutants, which are
pink, they are controls, IPO through to
[SPEAKER_00]: three is a control at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the greens, which are
the validation native promoter swaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we've effectively introduced the
nitrate reductase promoter instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: native promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you switch those strains
onto off media, which either contains an
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acid like glutamate, or on rich
media like YPD, hopefully you can see for
[SPEAKER_00]: both examples, that those strains can no
longer grow when those genes are switched
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of working reasonably well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've validated 15 genes to date from the
wall data.
[SPEAKER_00]: For being a candidate essential for life
genes in enzyme receptor atricide,
[SPEAKER_00]: although there is some confidentiality on
that at the moment due to the company
[SPEAKER_00]: being involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're also able to do of course now
going forward is that we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic resource of 25,000 mutants in
our minus 80 freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've started doing high throughput
screening of those basically in 96 well
[SPEAKER_00]: plate assays for different stress
responses to pre-screen them for then
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing them on wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to resequence their genomes
individually to identify candidate genes
[SPEAKER_00]: and validate them as novel targets and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be a cornerstone of
what we're going to do for quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the final part of the presentation
is some slightly different work in about
[SPEAKER_00]: how we're using enzyme receptor as a tool
for discovery of new microbe derived crop
[SPEAKER_00]: protection products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rothamstead research, we are quite
diverse in the number of staff and
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues we have, but we have many,
many field trials spread over the areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: our different research stations,
which are being sampled continuously,
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops, different environments,
different treatment regimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are sampled continuously for many
things, but also they're being sampled
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously also by our microbiologists
who are establishing cultures of various
[SPEAKER_00]: different bacteria but in this particular
example, I show you examples of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the collections they're making of
pseudomonads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are known to have
antifungal activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is through biocontrol and all the
other types of assays in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we would just set up a
simple assay, again, exploiting the yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: like cells of zymoseptoria tritici.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can effectively form a cell lawn
there, which you can see GFP tagged at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom just to be fancy, but you can make
a cell lawn of zymoseptoria cells and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can start spotting these little bacteria
on the top of that lawn to see whether any
[SPEAKER_00]: create a zone of inhibition, which is a
nice clear zone around where the bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: spot has gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this worked really, really well in a
PhD project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got 37 inhibitory bacteria through
the assay, which we sent for whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea was to start looking at secondary
metabolism to see if they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity the capability to produce any
interesting secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compared those 37 by sequencing 40
strains also that had no inhibitory
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in the antifungal assay as well
as a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have chemists at Rothamsted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very lucky they're just down the
corridor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they also did was generate LCMS
traces from the agar surrounding the zone
[SPEAKER_00]: of interaction, if you like, the little
halos that you can see there on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we were entered the sphere of
bacterial secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our student has generated a really
nice pipeline using available resources
[SPEAKER_00]: that are out there, plus some new tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able from his particular mini
collection of 39 strains to identify 120
[SPEAKER_00]: putative gene clusters for secondary
metabolites in the inhibitory bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: only 10 of which were known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it meant that even from that quite
small collection of strains, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the region of 110 unknown
secondary metabolites potentially being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by those bacteria, some of which
could be antifungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to tweak the assay as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I started this presentation,
I told you about how much genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variation we can see between zymosceptoria
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no point going down a
fungicide discovery route if you at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end find your fungicide will only target
two or three of those strains and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started screening all the bugs
against different zymosceptoria tritici
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates, which was very worthwhile
because we could start to see that some
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates were more resistant to inhibition
by some of the bacteria, whereas some were
[SPEAKER_00]: more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we started to focus down on those
bacteria that were always able to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: good strong level of inhibition of all
isolates of zymosceptoria tritici,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is yet another quantitative
trait in the fungus, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: this sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a proof of principle, what we did
identify in the genome of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitory bacteria were a biosynthetic
gene cluster that is likely to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: known product DAPG, so
2,4-diacetylfluoroglucanol, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown to be antifungal in various
different assays historically against
[SPEAKER_00]: various different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to identify that particular
cluster in reproducing in strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibited all zymosceptoria isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to find it in the genome,
and we were also able to identify the peak
[SPEAKER_00]: in the LCMS for 2,4-DAPG in the zone of
inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still had to prove or test as a
proof of concept that it was DAPG in those
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that were responsible for the
antifungal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed mutagenesis in bacteria
as well now, which is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the example of what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we targeted by mutagenesis
inactivation, a key DAPG biosynthetic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: called PHLD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you knock that particular gene
out in two of the inhibitory bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you can see on the slide there on
the right-hand side, you can see that they
[SPEAKER_00]: lose their halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose their ability to inhibit the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite clearly, DAPG was the secondary
metabolite produced by that, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: giving such consistent control of the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an in vitro assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our pipeline now is obviously focusing
more on some of these unknown,
[SPEAKER_00]: these new products that we've got from the
genomic bacterial predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an obvious question for about DAPG,
which is something that I found curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that, so can it be used as a crop
protection product in itself, or can the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that make it be used as a crop
protection product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a kind of biocontrol and a
chemical control assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summary, the biocontrol assay so
actually putting the bacteria on the wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf with the fungus, these are bacteria
that produce the DAPG were unable to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were obviously not resilient to
the leaf environment, not producing DAPG
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't quite know why yet, but it
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the chemical control using the
DAPG itself was giving us a dose response
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship for protecting leaves against
ZYMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, I think this supports our
general approach that we have for this
[SPEAKER_00]: project, which is to go using the genome
mining of the bacteria to go after the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolite clusters and go after
the chemistries themselves rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: using the bugs as biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that might be more difficult,
but perhaps not impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I think that was my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to summarize there and give
some perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope what I've shown you is that the
genetic diversity that you can see within
[SPEAKER_00]: ZYMOceptoria triticide populations can
actually be used against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you deploy pangenomics that focuses
down on what is core and what cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: mutated at a high rate with it by
individuals in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I've also shown you,
which we've known for some time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the outcome of the fungal plant
battle, if you like, is almost dictated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the fight between two fungal chitin
binding proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungal protein is currently winning
that against the plant receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what I hope I've shown is that the
yeast-like morphological growth phase is a
[SPEAKER_00]: super tool for many of the work we do on
ZYMOceptoria triticide for generating
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, populations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite unusual for a haploid
filamentous plant pathogen, so it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: a really good system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal cell walls are a valid target for
future methods of intervention,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of going forward,
I mentioned right at the start my thing
[SPEAKER_00]: about all these genes of unknown function
and how can you actually prioritize them
[SPEAKER_00]: and motivate yourself to work on those
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we're currently doing is
combining these two large data sets of the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein-specific natural variation we can
see, pangenome data, with our induced
[SPEAKER_00]: Abraham-Wald data to look at each
individual encoded protein of unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: function and to see what is mutating at a
very low rate, potentially in both data
[SPEAKER_00]: sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna prioritize those for some
functional analysis to see if we can start
[SPEAKER_00]: revealing some of the functions of the
dark matter of fungal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to acknowledge everybody
whose data I presented specifically today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on the left is my Rothamsted team
from now and before, PhD students,
[SPEAKER_00]: technicians, and bioinformaticians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been lucky enough on two of the
major projects to have support from
[SPEAKER_00]: Syngenta and Bayer, and obviously Barton
was a key collaborator for us in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: work we've done on the lysome effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the image there that I finished with
shows the GFP-tagged zymoseptoria tritici
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging from stomata of a destroyed wheat
leaf and getting ready to infect other
[SPEAKER_00]: green areas of the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to take any questions if
there are any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if anyone has any questions,
please feel free to put them in the chat
[SPEAKER_01]: or unmute and ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, Jason, I have a question about the
work that you presented in the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: on the chitin binding protein,
gosh, CT3 lysome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the transcriptomics, your sampling
began six days post inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was curious, what role do you think
that that protein plays in the latent
[SPEAKER_01]: phase?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does, how early would you expect
to see differences in expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for simplicity, I didn't show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, Luca, the PhD student that
took on this work, she made some three
[SPEAKER_00]: lysome-promoted GFP-expressing strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually started to look at when the
fungus lights up, when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculating wheat leaves with it,
when it's on super early, within a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the expression of that
particular gene may be linked in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition to hyphal growth, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be baked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus knows it's going hyphal,
and it may just be switching that on at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether they're separable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gillian, you had raised your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you comment in general about genes and
gene structure on dispensable chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, there are some key features.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the predicted genes on the
dispensable chromosomes, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of evidence for RIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look like they're inactivated,
duplicated copies of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes on the core chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's also more epigenetic
silencing on them as well, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably responsible for the very low
level of expression of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very few of them have obvious
predicted functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be smaller than the genes on
the core chromosomes, and there's very few
[SPEAKER_00]: really clear predicted functions on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, many of our colleagues are
very interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in this as well,
but my goal is to identify the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are really important for the variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend not to spend too much time
looking at them, apart from superficially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason, I had, I suppose, not a question,
more so a comment that I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your results in the last component
revealing that when applying bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures directly to leaves, you're in
many cases not getting effective
[SPEAKER_01]: management of the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for a lot of us who are
applying, trying to identify biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: products to manage diseases, we're often
using products that say they have active
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're waiting for colonization to
occur on the foliage in order for bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce the secondary metabolites and
other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so perhaps if we look instead for
products that just have the chemical of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest and bypass the need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's our angle, basically,
just because that's the way we are set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got chemists, we've got
microbiologists, bioinformaticians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just think that this is something that
we can run with in terms of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: product discovery pipelines rather than
biologicals, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the data I've shown you is
obviously just a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that doesn't mean to say it won't
ever work or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what we've tested so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does reinforce what we thought
would be our better approach or our
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred approach was to go after the
chemistry if we can, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the microbes make this stuff and
what they are and to see whether they can
[SPEAKER_00]: be synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be synthesized or in another way
to be tested as a natural crop protection
[SPEAKER_00]: product, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the wheat leaf, obviously,
is a pretty barren place for a microbe to
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I mean, we have started now
generating collections of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: directly from wheat leaves, so they should
be able to persist there, at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is their natural growth habitat,
whether they will fare any better or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they will have fungal inhibition
capability, we will find out in due
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was something in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether something popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we have a seminar room in a
building, and they're saying, I
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly appreciated thinking about
the essential genes through the lens of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Abraham Wald metaphor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fun to be upon that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's a question in the chat
Do you think the fast-forward genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: pipeline could work for other closely
related species, or is it specific for
[SPEAKER_01]: this pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the way we've set it up is
we're taking advantage of this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast-like growth we can have on rich
nutrient agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what allows us to print onto velvet
and to effectively treat it like a yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you have a very filamentous
pathogen, it would be more difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the throughput that we can with a more
yeast-like pathogen like xymoseptoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can manipulate your pathogen to
not be too high full under a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: growth condition so that you can print it
and make replica plate it easily enough at
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, then it should be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, if there are no other
questions, I'd like to thank Jason again
[SPEAKER_01]: for taking the time and presenting during
your dinner hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up now, I'm feeling hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the invitation and
have a nice afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
