[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can people hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really great pleasure to be here
and it's a pleasure to introduce and tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you the answer to my favorite story that
I've been working on for 27 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started this project, the first process
in 1990, and it literally has just
[SPEAKER_01]: finished in the last few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be a complete story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a corn project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love corn very much and this is one of
the things that defines, as you've studied
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the whole literature of corn,
cytogenic literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll run into this strange chromosome
called abnormal chromosome 10 over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I went to my postdoc and started
cytogenetics, I decided to start working
[SPEAKER_01]: on the genetics of this cytogenetic
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to do with basic Mendelian
inheritance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a figure I suspect most of you have
seen or taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shows two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows the law of independent
assortment, two different genes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting independently, and it also shows
the law of segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that you get equal frequencies
of each allele in such a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see this all the time and everybody
really takes this for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that the part that's most
taken for granted is the fact that the
[SPEAKER_01]: squares are shaped like squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the law of segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is such a law.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, much of biology is based on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very few laws in biology,
people who study biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really as close to a law as we
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so reproducible that it's the basis
for basically all of quantum genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's quite shocking when you find
that there are some exceptions to this
[SPEAKER_01]: law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time when you make a simple
test cross, it's easy to see the results
[SPEAKER_01]: in a test cross because it gives you half
and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: You expect to see a heterozygote by a
homozygote like this, 50% of the two
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes and phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in the cases of my outer drive where
it's been corrupted by some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: self-existent, you will see an
overabundance of one of those genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows a case of where you expect
to see 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a homozygote recessive tester
cross by heterozygote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, you would see 50% of both
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a seed color gene, which I'll talk
about as I go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in this case, it's been skewed by
some factor linked to the R gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is hemorrhagic chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phenotype of my outer drive,
you see it here in such a test cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a test cross, a simple single gene
test cross where the small R gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes colorless kernels,
is linked to the abnormal chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the first studied and
documented case of my outer drive,
[SPEAKER_01]: first found in 1942.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in all the textbooks, early
textbooks, and gave rise to a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: literature around the concept of my outer
drive where there are intentionally these
[SPEAKER_01]: are self-existent that have evolved
intentionally to favor their own
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission and avoiding those
limitations of selection on fitness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we find examples like that in all
kinds of cases, for example, in myosin and
[SPEAKER_01]: myrosopra, and also in nebulosis,
the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these actually don't work at the
level of meiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work after meiosis, so that the
meiosis will be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after, for instance, when sperm are
created, the system sets up a killer,
[SPEAKER_01]: a toxic protein in the sperm that don't
contain the myotic dry system and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially kills the ones that don't have
it, therefore ensuring its own survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are still called myotic drive,
but they don't involve meiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the myotic drive is called true myotic
drive and involves meiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the one that I've been
studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have to go through, and it is
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I do tend to go a little faster in
time, so I'm going to try and slow down to
[SPEAKER_01]: give a longer introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have here the 10 chromosomes of corn
at the stage of pacotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is when the chromosomes are lined
up, easiest to define.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the stages where McClintock
and others studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the longer chromosome
is one and it goes down to the shortest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shortest is normal chromosome 10
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the normal karyotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see corn is famous for these
large structures called knobs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which McClintock named and used as
cytogenetic markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have been taken for granted as
cytoloxy markers for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that those are all tied into
the abnormal 10 system as they proceed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In variant, sorry, in some lines of corn,
tropical, not in any modern inbreds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in all land races and all the
ascentates, there's a low frequency of
[SPEAKER_01]: this abnormal chromosome 10, which has all
the genes in normal chromosome 10 up until
[SPEAKER_01]: right about here, where there's some
rearrangements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chromosome is much longer and has
a very large knob at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that chromosome is abnormal chromosome
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the region I'll focus on entirely in
this talk is called the aptin haplotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: This part is non recombining with n10 and
in a very large haplotype, which contains
[SPEAKER_01]: the information required for this matter
drive property.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get straight pictures of
chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the computational tools from 3D
images, probably, which I can do that
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the knobs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just shown at DAPI level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they're heterochromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stand very deeply here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you look at them by fish,
we find that there are two types of null
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary one is 180 base pair repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one on large nominative 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains this three repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another minor repeat called
TR1 repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is shown here in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are 10 in repeats.
[SPEAKER_01]: 180 base pair and 350.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also other repeats,
centromere repeats in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these don't have any homology to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in this line, which is the
t-ascentae, how common knobs can be in
[SPEAKER_01]: some lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the line I showed you, the inbred line
I showed you, has four knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different inbreds differ from 5,
6, 10, 8, 10 knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's quite a bit of polymorphism in
knob content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see how common they can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the presence of aptin and knobs,
you see this amazing property,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially to a cytogeneticist in 1942,
of neo-centromere activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see it in the case where the knob
is heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows the centromere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows the four-strand stage where
crossing never happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there's two copies of this
chromosome on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one happens to have both repeats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this distance from the centromere,
and you can see they were pretty far away,
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be a crossover between the
centromere and the knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, that creates a
situation where there's a knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually called heteromorphic dyad,
because there's a knob on one of the two
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatids on each of the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally, in all cases, certainly in
most corn and all other species,
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily, you'll see anything on a
chromosome arm will lag behind during
[SPEAKER_01]: antifase, because nothing is moving the
chromosome arms normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during mitosis or meiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only the centromere normally has the
capacity to interact with the kinetochore,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that does all the pulling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things just drag behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have a line with abnormal
tendons, that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see now all the knobs in that
line show this remarkable streaming
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior where they rapidly move towards
the poles and get pulled far ahead at the
[SPEAKER_01]: true centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: The true centromere is still interactive,
but these things are moving ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to show you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've measured the rates in live
cells, and they move about 50% faster and
[SPEAKER_01]: get there much quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started this, I was thinking,
this is a long time ago, there was nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: known about centromeres in kinetochores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were called neocentromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking those should be kinetochore
proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's a genetic property,
which I know how to handle genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, I thought I could tear out a
mutant screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find the genes that caused that
behavior, and then that would lead me to
[SPEAKER_01]: better understand what normal centromeres
are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the very original concept,
would be using genetics to find this
[SPEAKER_01]: movement property to help us understand
normal centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see how this went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to talk about how both of
these now, both of the knob repeats will
[SPEAKER_01]: show the centromere activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just showing this nicely here,
showing, again, same kind of picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the real image.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's showing anaphase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the green now here is the
major knob repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most abundant one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That clearly moves towards the pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here how dramatic that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the TR1 repeat, which will become
a minor player as we go forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: also moves in a different fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have motility.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my slides going forward, I'll primarily
use this TR1 as a control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll focus on the green, which will
be the important one.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we see the strange behavior moves
faster, quicker, and generally doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually look like centromere behavior at
the psychological level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, do these
neocentromeres have actually any proteins
[SPEAKER_01]: that you find?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not normal centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've worked a lot in our lab over my
period at Georgia to identify antibodies
[SPEAKER_01]: for all the major kinetic core proteins
that are conserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've studied a lot on real
centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every time we got a new antibody for
the real centromere proteins, so this
[SPEAKER_01]: shows the biochemical, I call it the
biochemical chain between DNA and
[SPEAKER_01]: microtubule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a series of known proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: SNH3, CNPC, MS12, NDC80, all connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: between DNA and microtubule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have antibodies to all those proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I got them, I would say,
well, is this one found on neocentromeres?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer, in every case,
was always no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That protein is not found on
neocentromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this just shows one of them,
CNPC, which is a really highly conserved
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's found on a normal
centromere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in this line, we have 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the knobs are streaming forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there's no red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we observed in all these
other antibodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a form of movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not like real centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I drew this a long time ago,
because at that time, this is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: probably accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a highly regulated rate of
movement by normal centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It slows down their movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually de-primerizes the microtubules
as it moves all along the spindle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: anaphase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably why it's relatively
slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say real centromeres do all
the hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They line up chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry it, make sure the checkpoint is
operating properly, and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes are serving accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, neo-centromeres just take
advantage of an already established
[SPEAKER_01]: framework, which is the spindle,
and slide along the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both now refuse both the green and the red
to show this behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this looks like, everything about it
looks like it should be a protein in a
[SPEAKER_01]: class of motor proteins called kinesins,
which are microtubule-based motor
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are very common in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to be, there are forms that
can move in both directions on
[SPEAKER_01]: microtubules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either toward the plus end, which is the
wrong way for us, or at the minus end,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the correct way, which is towards
the pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, a long time ago, postulated that
this would, the neo-centromere motor would
[SPEAKER_01]: be a kinesin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a lot of work early on to
categorize all the kinesins in plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ultimately realized there was,
although there are such kinesins that do
[SPEAKER_01]: move that way, there are no kinesins known
in the world that also bind chromatin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some kinesins that bind
chromatin and go the other direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are kinesins that go the minus
end, which also bind to chromatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no naturally occurring
examples of, or prior literature,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a protein that binds chromatin on one
side and moves towards the minus end on
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just all, you know, such a mere
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does this relate back to
Maillard-Dry, which is how I started this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, this whole thing was first
found by its Maillard-Dry properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the preferential segregation of the
R allele linked to AB10.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little tricky, and I'll do this,
like, go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can exchange alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: R is just a marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: R is not AB10, but it's very close to
AB10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just switched alleles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're seeing preferential
segregation in chromatographs for the R,
[SPEAKER_01]: big R, color recurrent preferential
surrogate in this case, still linked to
[SPEAKER_01]: AB10, and this is the phenotype we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rhodes, in 1952, came up with the
Rhodes model,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he came up with the Rhodes model,
and he came up with the Rhodes model,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he came up with the Rhodes model,
and he came up with the Rhodes model,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he came up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhodes model, and he came up with the
Rhodes model, and found a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called terminal deficiencies,
broken forms of AB10, and breaking off
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of the chromosome and
showed the lack of Maillard-Dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had looked at all these quite
carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things he found was that you
could separate neocentromy activity from
[SPEAKER_01]: the knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a key question for about 50
years, was whether the knob itself could
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow cause its own neocentromy,
like something special about the
[SPEAKER_01]: heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really amazing heterochromatin
that you can just grab onto the fiddle by
[SPEAKER_01]: itself and move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had shown before my arrival that
you could break off pieces and this could
[SPEAKER_01]: be broken off and that would knock out the
essentially activity but retain the knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the knob itself wasn't able to show its
own essentially activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the whole chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just the apatite shown here and
that's drawn down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see this is the R gene I keep
talking about which marks the edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of inversions in here so
the gene order has changed here which
[SPEAKER_01]: locks it up into a haplotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see that they're on that
haplotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three of these small TR1 knobs and
as this slide coming up, this region is
[SPEAKER_01]: self-contained genetically so that there's
a motor that moves TR1 repeats here and a
[SPEAKER_01]: knob over here or a motor over here that
moves those repeats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went after this using genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main point was to find the neocentric
motor but I was going to use the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype which is that you can just make
a cross with the ear and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: preference of the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just screening for mutants in the
mild drug and anticipating that since
[SPEAKER_01]: neocentromeres are required to make that
happen, I would get mutants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neocentromere property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically this is one of the hardest
mutant screens because it requires that
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow up field of corn, set up a giant
open-pollinated cross, and lines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: all carrying abnormal tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they have a field of corn and
there's males and females, and females are
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed so the males are allowed to cross
onto the females to show them how to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thousands of lines all showing them how
to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wild type property, wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a genitor phenotype, this is the apten
normal phenotype from that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the normal ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are examples of putative mutants
we pulled out of one of those ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see these have more like
Mendelian segregation patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to go out, harvest,
and look at the ear and you could pick out
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis that had lost the capacity to
show myotic drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up with, after all, there were
many deletions we got, but we ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: with five mutants called suppressor myotic
drive mutants that appeared to be
[SPEAKER_01]: cytologically intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at the chromosome and I couldn't
see that it was broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed like it had the whole
chromosome yet it was unable to perform
[SPEAKER_01]: myotic drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five mutants intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ultimately figured out that all five
of these mutants are defective only
[SPEAKER_01]: towards neo-centromere activity at the 180
base pair green knob repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to walk you through how we
see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So N10, this is normal chromosome 10
anaphase figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this real centromere,
this is a centromere repeat labeled in
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what you normally see in
normal anaphase where the centromere is
[SPEAKER_01]: normally the only thing that can move on
the spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the centromere is the only thing that
can move on the spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then when we look at all these
mutants one by one, all of us forgot to
[SPEAKER_01]: point out that the deficiency L,
which is the one that is missing the very
[SPEAKER_01]: tip of the chromosome, all of these,
at least four of the mutants we looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: and deficiency L are all missing
neo-centromere activity specifically at
[SPEAKER_01]: the 180 base pair repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a control, show activity of the TR1
repeat which is genetically separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of figure shows that the
preparation is good because it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing TR1 activity, but the 180 base pair
repeats are lagging behind in all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mutants, first found by their defect in
the myotic drive, are now missing... We're
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is back to just remind you of what
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So deficiency L is the one I showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This becomes the key thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one that's missing the distal
tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing showed the exact same phenotype
as the 180 base pair repeats weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: moving as at least four of these mutants
and not this one we haven't looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that suggested that the gene
responsible for a 180 base pair
[SPEAKER_01]: neo-centromere activity is in that distal
tip region because deficiency L shows the
[SPEAKER_01]: same phenotype as the mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was early data suggesting that
this is where we should look to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: neo-centromere motor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far I didn't know what the gene was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a straight up RNA-seq approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we have the deficiency L
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the peptin progenitor showing
complete haplotype and then this special
[SPEAKER_01]: variant which is just missing that tip and
which is defective for that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: activity and did and carefully back
crossed lines to high coverage sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: and found a bunch of candidates,
most of which turned out to be pseudo
[SPEAKER_01]: genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found at this point the gene which
I'll spend the rest of the talk talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about which is called kinesin driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is apparently as far as I can
tell only one gene out there, a real gene
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is precisely the kind of kinesin I
was at before back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a C terminal kinesin of the type that
should move in the proper direction and as
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see it's slightly modified
suggesting it's the right kind of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this came out from a cDNA or RNA-seq
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the cDNA and I wanted to find
out what the gene looked like on the
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because apten is not present in any of
the agronomic lines or any of the sequence
[SPEAKER_01]: lines anybody works with, there's no
genomic resources so we had to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: back library which we did and probe that
back library with the cDNA trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: the genomic copies of that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point we found out there's way
more copies of the kinder gene than we
[SPEAKER_01]: would have expected based on the size of
the library which is a 4X library.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 23 clones hybridizing to the cDNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: This suggested that it was a A gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gene family, not just one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I skim sequenced all these facts and
put them into categories and then we fully
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced a set, A to the N, fully
sequenced, end to end, packed
[SPEAKER_01]: biosequenced, A to these facts which we
thought contained different kinder genes
[SPEAKER_01]: and assembled those into that context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had been working on this new
technology for scaffolding which is called
[SPEAKER_01]: optical mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biomechanical optical mapping which is a
way of basically taking this real DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: showed on a nanochannel array.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically you take real DNA which has been
cut at a restriction site and nicked and
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled to make green spots at a certain
restriction site and it runs through
[SPEAKER_01]: nanochannels and then images are taken and
then from this dot pattern restriction
[SPEAKER_01]: maps are made and they are assembled into
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: This then gives you a restriction map of
the whole apten genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no sequence data but it does have a
map and a really nice restriction mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that the value of this is that
it allows you to then orient and place
[SPEAKER_01]: back context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the greatest moments of
this, several great moments in this
[SPEAKER_01]: project where these are the back context
we picked out by hybridizing to the kinder
[SPEAKER_01]: cDNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sequenced and assembled into
context and they each had totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinder apparently or slightly
different kinder genes and then we aligned
[SPEAKER_01]: that up based on in silico digesting the
backs and aligning that to the restriction
[SPEAKER_01]: digest map.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the bio nanomap up here and it
clearly shows that this is a long ten
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat array of at least eight sequence
and probably nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is present in the bio nanomap but
not the sequence map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say there's nine kinder genes lined
up over a one mega base area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is quite a large gene family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have gene families in corn but there
are some that are large but not like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are like the Z in cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some disease resistant genes that
have clusters like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is among the biggest arrays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn is a large messy genome but it
doesn't retain long ten repeat arrays of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this suggests it's so special about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've used mutants to identify potential
candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use genomics to find a potential gene
candidate to connect the mutant to the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked then at the expression of
kinder in all of our mutants and found
[SPEAKER_01]: that two of the mutants had reduced or
totally absent expression of the kinder
[SPEAKER_01]: complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call this the kinder complex now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has become these nine kinder genes
together called the kinder complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is expression of, this is wild head
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said by the way the different colors
here show different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people often ask me are all of these
genes expressed or is it just one
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed in a very high level?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't tell them all apart but we can
tell five SNP categories apart by their,
[SPEAKER_01]: by SNPs to differentiate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of the five classes we can
differentiate by SNPs, four are expressed
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure in AB10 by looking at RNAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do the same experiment either by
quantitative PCR or by RNAC in these two
[SPEAKER_01]: mutants, that can be one which is reduced
to 10% expression of kinder and FM12 which
[SPEAKER_01]: has no, absolutely no transcript either by
quantitative PCR or by RNAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing there but the whole
collection is expressed in this mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a strange form of mutant and
also we've re-sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We re-sequenced those mutants to make sure
that the kinder complex was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: present because deletions are quite common
in this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Re-sequenced for sure the whole kinder
complex is present in those mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two mutants have nine copies,
four of which are normally expressed and
[SPEAKER_01]: yet don't have any expression for the
entire cluster of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this suggests that there's some sort of
epigenetic inactivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really only one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably some other ways but the
most obvious way is to, is to imagine that
[SPEAKER_01]: all those genes are knocked out by some
epigenetic RNAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways of knocking out genes
through an RNA-based mechanism that
[SPEAKER_01]: involves mobile RNAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so first thing we did was look at
small RNAs is relatively inexpensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap and expensive to sequence RNAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small RNAs, so we sequence small RNAs from
the, for gender and the SMB12 mutant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the one that has no expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all genes, it turns out,
in corn have an upstream spike of small
[SPEAKER_01]: RNAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a barrier sequence which
separates the transposons from the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is very normal for all expressed
genes to see a spike of small RNAs
[SPEAKER_01]: upstream and downstream of the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, this is what kinder looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a huge, it's a strange gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 14 KB intron followed by a set of
exons and a very long three prime UTR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in SMB12, which has no expression,
there's a clear shift in the distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: of small RNAs suggesting some change in
the targeting small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So small RNAs can result in the loss of
the expression by activating DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: methylation of the locus first through a
process of DNA methylation which leads to
[SPEAKER_01]: stable methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that's analyzed is by looking
at the profile of methylation using
[SPEAKER_01]: bisulfite sequencing, because in our case
we use whole genome bisulfite sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: to basically give you a full vision of the
methylation pattern of the kinder genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows a kinder metagene because we
have nine genes which can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiated from each other separately
by sequence, they're too similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all this is the average, what I'm
showing you is the average methylation
[SPEAKER_01]: profile of the nine kinder genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just looking at the SMB12
mutant, which is the one with the loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows the distribution of three
different methylation contexts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CG methylation is the one that's most
commonly discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I would say, the most powerful
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also present in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see CG methylation in the
upstream motor area, usually there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants also have CHG methylation,
and this is also generally associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: transposons in active areas, almost never
found in gene bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also CHH methylation,
which is generally associated with de novo
[SPEAKER_01]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's associated with that RNA-based form
of de novo methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at ABTEN, progenitor,
it shows a pattern of methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, for CG methylation,
there's something called gene body
[SPEAKER_01]: methylation, which confuses the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even normal genes generally have quite a
bit of CG methylation through the gene
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for progenitor, there's quite a bit of
CG methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see subtle change in SMB12 even in
the promoter, a little bit towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: For CHG methylation, there's a quite a
dramatic change, but there's an increase
[SPEAKER_01]: in CG methylation in the SMB in orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way across, the gene thought of
that as highly unusual, and usually only
[SPEAKER_01]: found for genes that are poorly expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a shift in the CHH,
which generally reflects small na,
[SPEAKER_01]: targeting a shift in the CHH pathway,
which appears to target the promoter and
[SPEAKER_01]: also a region in the first intron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that suggested, well, that clearly
shows there's a change in the pattern of
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA methylation associated with this loss
of gene expression in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the promoter is the most important area
to look at in a case like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is about the only area in
the, around that's consistently not
[SPEAKER_01]: methylated in active genes across all of
angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this little dip here is quite
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look here at the finer detail based by
base detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: At ABTEN, you can see this is the actual,
this plus mark, that's the stern
[SPEAKER_01]: transcription right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there's a dip or complete
absence of methylation, generally right
[SPEAKER_01]: around this first 50, 100 basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally have almost no methylation in
the active gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And SMB12 is strong methylation across the
entire promoter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing gets strongly suggested
if you don't see that in active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see in this case, a shift,
clear increase in CG methylation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is virtually never found in active
genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a slight shift in the,
called CHH island, which I didn't try not
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk too much about here, towards the,
towards the promoter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are, these are clear shifts,
which are unusual and not found generally
[SPEAKER_01]: in active genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I also, by the way, we looked at
SMB1, the other mutant I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a whole genome, bisulfite sequencing,
that was quite expensive to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did targeted bisulfite sequencing
and basically saw the same pattern in SMB1
[SPEAKER_01]: and 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had identified two mutants,
SMB1 and 12, which were totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: screens, which had roughly the same
genotype, a lack of mono drive,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lack of near centromere activity,
and a lack of expression for kinder,
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently associated with the change in
DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was still some concern that
perhaps methylation was reflecting some
[SPEAKER_01]: larger patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of thing is rarely found.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's no good examples of epi
mutants like this in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can say that this is an effect,
not a cause of the phenotype you're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps there's some other mutation
closely linked, like a regulator that
[SPEAKER_01]: regulates all nine genes, which is off,
and that's resulting in a change in
[SPEAKER_01]: methylation change.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this is not the common thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to address that concern, we also had
carried out an RNAi experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a standard thing to do once
you found a gene like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to target the one area
which differs from other kinesins,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the front part of the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically in the case that you
create an RNAi construct, put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, and then cross it to aptin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the genotype of the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's heterozygous for aptin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to use heterozygous to see myiotic
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heterozygous for RNAi because I just
crossed it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those things are heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just crossing it to some tester
line, which is recessed into two
[SPEAKER_01]: characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, myiotic drive from this
individual, in the normal case,
[SPEAKER_01]: would show this pattern, which is the
myiotic drive pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is, the myiotic drive is the
property of the plant that crossed to gave
[SPEAKER_01]: the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ear reflects the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw, then, in some of these,
that in two of the five RNAi lines we
[SPEAKER_01]: tested, a reduction in myiotic drive,
consistent with what we expected that
[SPEAKER_01]: knocking down kinder would reduce myiotic
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are ears showing a reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes some sense because we know RNAi
knocks down RNA, should reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of RNA present, and should reduce the
amount of kinder, and should reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of myiotic drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that already was enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we noticed in these progeny,
because the RNAi construct is segregating
[SPEAKER_01]: as well, is after this progeny of these
individuals, take these purple kernels
[SPEAKER_01]: here, clamp them, and now look at their
expression level for kinder, and
[SPEAKER_01]: categorize them, whether or not they had
the RNAi construct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found was that there was a
clear total loss of kinder expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less, in all the lines that had
the RNAi construct, and what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would normally expect individuals
that did not have the RNAi construct.
[SPEAKER_01]: RNAi is a post transcriptional process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally that dosha, that recovered kinder
expression, we saw in cases here where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no RNAi, many cases, where there
was a total loss of gene expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though the RNAi inducer had been
segregated away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is quite rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are examples of this in
Arabidopsis, where people have shown early
[SPEAKER_01]: literature showing that you can,
in principle, use RNAi to knock out a gene
[SPEAKER_01]: at the DNA methylation level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a classic example of
RNA-dependent methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's quite rare, certainly starting
from RNAi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this seemed to be quite easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew this individual plant,
crossed it once, confirmed the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: grew progeny from that, crossed it again,
and confirmed the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just the only one that we've
carried all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one definitely has AB10, definitely
has no RNAi construct, and definitely does
[SPEAKER_01]: not have myodride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I added this to the bisulphide
analysis, and we find, even better
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of called Ki1, now
RNAi-induced epimutant, you can see,
[SPEAKER_01]: critically, I think the most important
thing here is that this is the green line
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a full Cg methylation completely
across the promoter, which is what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have hoped to see for SMD12 to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this thing has all the characteristics
of being completely flat dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look now at the promoter
here, I'm looking at the traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in Cg methylation associated with
that flat green line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a total loss of this so-called
CHH island, which generally marks active
[SPEAKER_01]: gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this thing, which was, that's the wrong
name, this thing actually came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted knockout, a knockdown of kinder,
resulting in a total knockout of kinder at
[SPEAKER_01]: the DNA level, as I said, by DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows, I think unequivocally,
that kinder is required for aromatic
[SPEAKER_01]: drive, and presumably the neocentrum
motor.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about the evolution of kinder?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some homologs in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all nine of the kinders are on the tail
of that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is because, remember, I started
here with the gene tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all nine of those kinders are out here
in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some homologs in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the only kinesin in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the closest homolog is called Zmkin11,
which is over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another homolog called Dby,
which is over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look at the sequence analysis now
of this kinder sequence as compared to its
[SPEAKER_01]: closest homolog, Zmkin11 and Dby,
and you see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is the natural progenitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the actual ancestor of kinder,
or 12 million years ago it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the first
intramuscular macula expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kinder is missing four exomes in this
so-called coiled coiled omega,
[SPEAKER_01]: which mediates interaction between kinase
and timers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise it has a completely normal,
apparently functional motor domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So its main differences are its missing
part of this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this front exon is larger and
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's duplicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's duplicated, so it's hard to
see in this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, this is the first exon of
kin11, and this is the first exon of
[SPEAKER_01]: kinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this region is duplicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bunch of amino acid changes
in there, all to charge that we use,
[SPEAKER_01]: which strongly suggests a change in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the last exon of kin11,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is the last exon of kin11.
It's duplicated.
And we're not really doing much to avoid
having to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that because DV1, which is the
other one in the other homolog of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome, is sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually found this gene and cloned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually has a spindle morphology
defect like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's wild type focus spindle pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's DV1 mutant, and you can see this
laid spindle pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the normal function of the
progenitor of kinder is to facilitate
[SPEAKER_01]: spindle formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the part that interacts with it that
does that function is missing and modified
[SPEAKER_01]: in kinder, really strong in suggesting it
has a new function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it evolved, if you look at the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It evolved 12 million years ago,
which is an important time for corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's when the last whole genome
duplication occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gave rise to where we have an ancient
tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also happened right about the time
that corn separated from sorghum,
[SPEAKER_01]: and before the time that after sorghum,
before the time that trypsum diverged from
[SPEAKER_01]: sorghum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, what we see is that this
time, probably the origin of kinder
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to the ancient genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably the ancient paralogue
of xanthine 11, which has taken on this
[SPEAKER_01]: new function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also found kinder and xanthine 11 in
this species, related species called
[SPEAKER_01]: trypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trypsum also has knobs, whereas
sorghum does not have kinder and does not
[SPEAKER_01]: have knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this all suggests that kinder is
involved in the evolution of knobs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'll get to in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also looked at the evolution of the
kinder complex gene by gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the work of Jeff Giffoff and
Darren's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shows we have all these different
genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the very earliest origin of the first
kinder was 12 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look and compare the sequence
among all the different homeologues here,
[SPEAKER_01]: this all happened within the last 500,000
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there's been a lot of gene
conversion across and over among these
[SPEAKER_01]: types, as you would expect for gene
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this suggests that kinder evolved a
long time ago and is still evolving,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least at the level of gene families in
the last 500,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kinder is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's required from out of drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It thrives near centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has had a major effect on the
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general concept of the relationship
between knobs and kinder is that all knobs
[SPEAKER_01]: have evolved in response to kinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we rarely see knobs in anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knobs are not that common, especially
in the middle of chromosome arms,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the most genes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally, a highly repetitive region
would only be found at the telomeres,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the centromeres are recombinative,
which is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: The presence of super large knobs in the
middle of the genome region is highly
[SPEAKER_01]: unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this and other arguments led others to
suggest that all these knobs have evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: to take advantage of kinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kinder normally evolved just to take
care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kinder only cares about itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped to facilitate the evolution of
this knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So itself would be preferentially
transmitted to the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, since it's made of kinesin,
which is all over the place in the cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: other knob repeats popped up everywhere
else in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all taking advantage of this
kinder protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this drive, or this force,
would be the creation of all the knob
[SPEAKER_01]: repeats in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see, this is the effect of
kinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much of the genome?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made up of knob repeats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the assembled size of the made genome
is 2.1 gigabits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This basically excludes all repeats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that in B73, this is one of the
few knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a high knob land race, very closely led
to B73, you can be as high as 19%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in these are Tiacente relatives,
we have low knob and high knob versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tiacente is extending up to about 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the 20% of the genome in maize,
it's made up of this simple 100 megabase
[SPEAKER_01]: per repeat, which converts to 500
megabases of DNA, which is larger than the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire genome of some grass species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's driven knob repeats to
extraordinary levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really shaped the genome quite
dramatically, just in terms of gene 100 of
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA content.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the observation that while
knobs are involved to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_01]: kinder, when they drive, they also drive
genes next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I showed you, that the R gene is a
linked marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, marks have 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no way to escape.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a knob, it's right in the middle
from some arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those genes will be driven along with
the knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the 50s and 60s, people showed this
to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did this myself, just to show the
actual cross of our geneticists who like
[SPEAKER_01]: to see things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a knob linked to a gene which
causes greenness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple test cross scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a preference to recover the
green link to the knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of, again, because it's a
link marker next to a knob, would be
[SPEAKER_01]: expected to extend to all the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did this experiment where I create a
line, which is header ligands for AB10,
[SPEAKER_01]: or for lacking AB10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Control line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And headers ligands for two knobs in
chromosome four, a knob in chromosome six,
[SPEAKER_01]: and carrying AB10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the positions of the knobs are shown
here with these arrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: AB10 is out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one in chromosome six,
and then the two knobs in chromosome four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is basically a giant test
cross scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made a line containing W23,
B73, and a test cross back to B73,
[SPEAKER_01]: header ligands for these knobs,
and then looking for segregation
[SPEAKER_01]: distortion around the knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red knob shows the line containing
AB10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the green and the blue knob shows the
paired samples that lacked AB10,
[SPEAKER_01]: showing what happened to this population
without AB10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can test for significance of
preferential segregation, and you see
[SPEAKER_01]: clear, obvious peaks of preferential
segregation over these knobs, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: header ligands in the sample, which I
think is very pretty to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great graph from my colleague at
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to get out the percent of
the genome affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just take these four knobs and
say how much of the genome is affected,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 172 megabases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can count the number of genes that
meet just those four knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 4,500 genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you divide by four, it's roughly
1,000 genes are affected every time a knob
[SPEAKER_01]: is driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in a line which is header
ligands for just two knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number of knobs in corn is
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows the psychological
distribution of knobs in the case of days
[SPEAKER_01]: of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the known knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ancient ones went through and
cataloged locations for all the knobs and
[SPEAKER_01]: all known varieties of corn throughout the
Americas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all the positions where
knobs are known to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 30 positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just simply extrapolate,
which is almost probably close to correct,
[SPEAKER_01]: that every knob can drive 1,000 genes,
that makes it about three-quarters of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome is under the influence of ABTEN
whenever ABTEN is present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it has to be header ligands,
the line has to carry the knobs,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's an oversimplification.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least in the history of corn,
there have been genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three-quarters of the genes of corn have
been driven at some level by the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of ABTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, it has increased genome size by
20%, 500 megabases, and influence the
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation behavior of three-quarters of
the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, yeah, like I said,
a very powerful gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't it gone to fixation?
[SPEAKER_01]: People say, well, really, it's been around
12 million years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a 75%, 80% segregation advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't it gone to fixation?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no examples of any population that
we have found where it's gone to fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go around the world, march around
the world, look at the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: ascent days and corn, you find it's
present in about, overall, about 13% to
[SPEAKER_01]: 15% of different natural isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individuals you pull will contain ABTEN,
but there's no population where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the final interesting part of this
story is that while we are discovering
[SPEAKER_01]: kinder and showing that this is a gene
family that drives neurosensory activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also found that there's something
called pseudokinder present on NTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an NTEN, normal NTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's B73 in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing is to a, over about 100 kb
area, contains six copies of an inverted
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat structure, just containing the
internal part of kinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, six of this 12 copies in
inverted or in repeat orientation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just quite remarkable that this
counts for 1.2% of all the natural sRNAs
[SPEAKER_01]: in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like NTEN is one reason is
that ABTEN has not extended the range
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond what it would have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's currently stuck at, at 13%,
because NTEN has evolved as a suppressor
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism, probably evolved with the
epigenetic and activation process that we
[SPEAKER_01]: observed as mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this large mutant screen,
I found mutants and I found, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised to find epialleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's probably just a reflection of the
natural defense mechanism that's ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: and this battle between NTEN and ABTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that always loses when
ABTEN is present is NTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the poor NTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're not everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can just get lucky and it
won't be a knob next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whenever ABTEN comes around,
NTEN loses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the natural place for some kind
of suppressor to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this looks like, it feels like,
but we have no evidence that this thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the epigenetic and activation
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this concludes what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I've shown that kinder is the
neo-centromere gene responsible for myotic
[SPEAKER_01]: drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's remarkable that there are nine
copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hidden gene family present in the
distal tip of ABTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nine copies probably because it
has to, it had a problem as it evolved and
[SPEAKER_01]: other knobs started evolving around the
genome to take advantage of the activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other knob repeats, 500 megabases of
knob repeats started to evolve,
[SPEAKER_01]: it started to lose its own capacity to
drive itself because it was being diluted
[SPEAKER_01]: by these other knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is probably a direct outcome of
the fact that the genome has cumulated so
[SPEAKER_01]: many knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to expand its own cock number to
make enough protein to drive its own cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is ABTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: That expansion of the gene family may
actually lead to its demise because as it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets larger, it starts to look more and
more like a transposon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is one reason why we see,
we see a relatively high frequency of
[SPEAKER_01]: epimutants because it's just such a high
copy selfish element much like a
[SPEAKER_01]: transposon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's expanded genome size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a remarkable part of this
by 500 megabases and shifting the
[SPEAKER_01]: expression of three-quarters of the gene
to corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's being suppressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much like a transposon because it's a
real awakening for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should have thought of it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selfish system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much like a transposon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's high copy number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being shut down by the same system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I've worked on this for so long
that it's impossible to, this is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: random picture from the Navy, which I
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa worked on ABTEN, he worked on ABTEN.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a longer list of students.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably six or eight students who
worked on this postdocs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had, although I've done most of
this myself, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had collaborators, Jeff Rossi-Bera,
Michelle, who's an evolutionary biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian Burschler has been always helpful on
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Buckler has helped me with TBS and
tuna typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason Wallace at UGA did that
beautiful preferentials irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: display.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a chromosome that's
heterozygous for two different knobs,
[SPEAKER_03]: like say a chromosome one and there's a
knob on the upper arm of one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: homologous chromosomes, and then there's a
knob on the lower arm of the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they compete?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that shows that points
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so, because those would be
widely separated by crossing over.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a case where there's normally a long
arm and a short arm, that would not be a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does raise the question of why
there are, some of those arms had three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't quite see how those
evolved, because I think they should
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they must be far enough away that they
have suspiciously like a fourth revolve in
[SPEAKER_01]: a different position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a case where you have two knobs in
slightly different positions in
[SPEAKER_01]: opposition, there's no drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're on the same chromosome,
you saw what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a chromosome four, you just get a very
strong drive for those two areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has seen evidence of conflict
between knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might imagine that if knobs
recombine or that somehow they decide to
[SPEAKER_01]: go opposite directions, or for instance,
other people often ask the centromere,
[SPEAKER_01]: how does the centromere know to go the
same direction as the knob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't see any evidence of errors
anywhere in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's extremely good at avoiding
dicenter chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might imagine the centromere goes
one way and the knob goes the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually never happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't see evidence of conflict
between knobs either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this probably has to do with the
temporal separation of when the knob goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes very early and probably makes a
decision for the centromere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to revert it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it should revert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly SMD1, which is not a complete
knockout, tried to revert that using MOF1,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the system basically should knock
out the RDVM pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suppose you could look at a higher
frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would look at 50 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think it would revert to the high
frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does not revert to the high
frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so no, did not try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was almost going to do that when I only
had one allele, but then I had three
[SPEAKER_01]: alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did not check shigoshin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what he's asking us to do, shigoshin is
a marker of sister chromatid adhesion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows sisters to retain together when
they're lining up the spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the clean answer to that is that knobs
never line up like that on the spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't see any of the sister
chromatid adhesion at all for knobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do their own thing totally separate.
I wouldn't expect it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're required to connect DNA
microtubule normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I'm saying is that biochemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, do you think that's all
they do is the orientation of the central.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all they do is bind to it and
then move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably none of those are both called
sperm killers or their post-biotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the ones where it sets up a
system where they would be the gamete that
[SPEAKER_01]: does not contain a killer dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Drosophila, SD is the most famous
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have SD, which is a dominant locus,
and then you have the poor, suffering,
[SPEAKER_01]: paired chromosome, which is going to lose
in this battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So SD has a killer, a toxic protein,
which will go and kill this other gamete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, encodes for itself an
immunity, something that makes it immune
[SPEAKER_01]: to that toxic protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a toxic protein that kills its
sperm that doesn't have it, while giving
[SPEAKER_01]: itself a shot of immunity to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the more typical one.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are quite typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these sperm killer type
systems exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make a huge difference because
they don't affect meiosis at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't affect genome structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful seminar and beautiful
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to follow up on this question,
were your pictures in poppin mother cells?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so all the elaborate what he's
saying, which is that the phenotype isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: female, but we do all of our work in the
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a potential problem,
but seems to be not a real problem since I
[SPEAKER_01]: managed to use it to find the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the neo centromere activity is also
present in the male, but it has no effect
[SPEAKER_01]: on the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, has anybody, you've done
enough work, believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody tried to isolate kinder,
get the protein?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there needs to be some, we need to do
basic motor assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any idea of the pharmacology
of it from the sequence?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite straightforward for a lot of
people in the world who are quite good at
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so functionally important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These assays, which are sliding assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about it is, you know,
the fact that I've shown that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: attach a knob to the penicillin suggests
that you should be able to attach other
[SPEAKER_01]: cartos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In principle, we can be able to,
we should be able to do almost anything
[SPEAKER_01]: with myosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any idea how the pseudo,
or the neo centromere, like, knows which
[SPEAKER_03]: way to go, like to the right pole?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just makes one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I think is, it goes early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, basically you see neo
centromere activity as soon as the spindle
[SPEAKER_01]: exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spindle starts to form, and it's a
tiny little spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see already the neo centromere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simplistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very simple minded thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the kind of thing that just moves to
the minus end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by going there and going so quickly,
I think it pulls the natural centromere
[SPEAKER_01]: around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why does it go towards where the basal
cell will be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the trick that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes both directions in equal way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, no, but you have to, it chooses
both the bottom and the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It avoids the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it chooses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how does it avoid the middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by driving, yeah, by driving it to the
pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a slight, he wants me to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk later.
We can talk later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think let's thank Kelly.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
