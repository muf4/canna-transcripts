[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I need to apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized on the way down in the
elevator, I switched the title around.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the poster, it says, angstroms to
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: I switched it to acres to angstroms just
due to the presentation of the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with my field soils and
then move more to my molecular level
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in essence, this is going to be
an overview of my dissertation work that's
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly focused on the interaction of soil
organic matter with mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a quick outline of what I'm going to go
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover my background,
kind of explain why I'm asking the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to show some results from
some field soils that I collected from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up with a series of
laboratory scale experiments looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: model systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully have some time for
acknowledgments and some really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so some quick background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil organic carbon and nitrogen
represent really important pools of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the planet for reasons that have
already been covered extensively this
[SPEAKER_00]: semester in the seminar series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main reasons is because
soil organic matter, which contains carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitrogen, is stabilized in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few really big known
stabilization mechanisms of soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is physical occlusion of soil
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our organic matter here and we
surround it with something like a mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: particles or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not accessible for microbial
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence it is stabilized and remains in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also this concept of chemical
recalcitrance where we have these big kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of bulky, hulking molecules that are
unwieldy to attack enzymatically and they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't mineralized and hence are
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's this last point that I'm
going to be talking primarily about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is this association of organic
matter with soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Angela kind of talked about a month
or two ago, this can take on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is the co-precipitation of
organic matter with soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other form is what I'm going to be
talking about today primarily is the
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption of organic matter from solution
onto mineral surfaces or soil particles in
[SPEAKER_00]: various forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dissolved organic matter, if we're
going to be talking organic matter in
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, we're going to be talking about
the dissolved organic matter fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you pick up a soil science textbook
and go back to the glossary and look up
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved organic matter or DOM,
you're going to get a definition that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mixture of soluble organic materials
derived from the release and or partial
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition of plant and microbial
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I underline mixture there because I think
it's an exceptionally important point
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dissolved organic matter readily
absorbs on mineral surfaces, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all components have a tendency to
absorb equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some factors that we know
associated with dissolved organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: composition have a pretty big impact on
the adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is molecular size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking at the adsorption of my
favorite molecule here, gallic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a mineral surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we looking at this more kind of
polymerized complex counterpart?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the name of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, this is larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dissolved organic matter molecules
that are larger have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: preferentially absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The functionality, so the functional group
composition of the organic matter is also
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically, organic matter
that's enriched in functional groups like
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatic, phenolic, and carboxylate type
groups are believed to play a really
[SPEAKER_00]: important role in retention of dissolved
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least is the
elemental composition of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter itself, the DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, DOM with carbon to
nitrogen ratios on the low side that is
[SPEAKER_00]: higher in nitrogen relative to carbon is
believed to associate very strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: directly with mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could take the form of something
like this nice model peptide here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left, but also biomolecular constituents
like this BT toxin here on the right also
[SPEAKER_00]: would be retained pretty strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can probably tell from the
title and so many other presentations this
[SPEAKER_00]: semester on organic matter interactions
with soils, this is a cross-scale thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not simply a molecular level issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in soils, we have a lot of surface
inputs of dissolved organic matter either
[SPEAKER_00]: through release or release actively by
roots or through senesce plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is as this dissolved
organic matter enters the soil solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: it percolates downward through the soil
matrix where it's subsequently projected
[SPEAKER_00]: to a series of inputs and losses as it
moves through the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the main inputs are released
by biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also see desorption and release of
dissolved organic matter back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the main losses that we're
aware of that we know that occur in soils
[SPEAKER_00]: are this adsorption by the soil matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get uptake by soil biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also get co-precipitation of
the organic matter with minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, as we move down
the profile, the losses kind of went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tend to see less dissolved organic
matter as we go down the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of had a question with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have DOM inputs at the surface
and all these downstream processes going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, what happens if we take the surface
soil where the bulk of organic matter is
[SPEAKER_00]: and we kind of invert it or we disturb it
as one might see in, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage in an agricultural system?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that do to all these downstream
processes of dissolved organic matter in a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that question in mind,
I'm going to start showing some results
[SPEAKER_00]: from some field studies that I did looking
at dissolved organic matter dynamics in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural soil from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the specific field site that I used
is the Penn State Russell Larson Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Center in Rock Springs,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got working with these plots back when I
was still a baby, a Penn State student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a picture of me then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys wouldn't even be able to tell the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these field sites are located
basically smack dab in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the absolutely gorgeous Ridge and
Valley province of PA in the nice big
[SPEAKER_00]: limestone valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plots that I used are part of this
tillage experiment that was initiated back
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1978.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy 40th birthday tillage experiment
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pretty long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there were three or four
different types of tillage treatments in
[SPEAKER_00]: these 24 plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I focused only on two plots and two
tillage treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the no-till treatment and
the moldboard tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plots were subjected to a
moldboard tillage and moldboard disting to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 centimeters every year in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something else I'd like to point out
is the sampling that I did within these
[SPEAKER_00]: plots, I sampled at a couple of different
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this access road here that cuts
adjacent to the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sampled that 125 feet, 375, and 625 feet
from that access road.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sampling itself, it looked like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pulled three cores out of the ground
at each one of those sites and pulled them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the cores looked like
from the till plot and the no-till plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the soil we're working
with here is kind of a, well, these aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: the best pictures, but this is what is
called the Hagerstown soil series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a fairly typical alphasol,
which was developed over limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: residuum down in central PA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't glaciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are fairly old soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the lighting were a little bit
better and these cores weren't dried,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could really see, at the tilled soil,
what it's made up of is basically a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: well-defined AP horizon down to 20
centimeters, followed by a series of BT
[SPEAKER_00]: horizons as we move down the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the no-till soil also has an A
horizon, but it's more of a gradual
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease into the BT horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I had those cores, I pulled them
again into three, and then I split them up
[SPEAKER_00]: into five different depth increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I was interested in
isolating and characterizing the dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the focus of this
study was the DOM fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a fairly standard DOM extraction
procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspended the soil and water at a one to
10 soil water ratio, shook it overnight,
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it through a 0.2 micron filter,
and subjected the filtrate to a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization methods, one of which is
just total organic carbon and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: within.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DOM fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some optical characterization with
UV vis spectrophotometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at the extent of aromatic
functionalities within the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last, but certainly not least
here, I made some fluorescence excitation
[SPEAKER_00]: emission matrices of the organic matter
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get more into what that means as
I get closer to working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a feel for the bulk soils
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of properties do these have?
[SPEAKER_00]: These soils are mildly acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a pH around 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the samples deviated too far from
that, which is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was kind of nice knowing that
pH wouldn't be a confounding factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texturally, the soils kind of had a real
silt-rich topsoil and became gradually
[SPEAKER_00]: finer as we went down into the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mineralogy of these soils is kind
of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some aluminosilicate clays,
illite and kaolinite, that dominate the
[SPEAKER_00]: clay fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also did some extractions that
showed that there's a decent amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: crystalline iron oxides in the soil that
might have a pretty big impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface reactivity of the mineral
particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the bulk carbon and
nitrogen distributions of the soils here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of see the textbook trend that you
would expect to see with depth knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the surface layer is kind of
homogenized as far as the carbon contents
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitrogen contents as well are
concerned, followed by a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitous drop off in the subsoils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't the case for the no-till
soils, where we kind of start off
[SPEAKER_00]: generally with higher concentrations of
carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get more of a gradual
decrease, as we would expect in a system
[SPEAKER_00]: with less disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dissolved organic matter itself
kind of follows somewhat of a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: trend, where the organic matter in a
dissolved fraction, the contents,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, are homogenized within the
plow layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also get this quick drop off below
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, no-till system, it's more of a
gradual type decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true for both the carbon and
the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the carbon-nitrogen
ratios of the dissolved organic fraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that, generally speaking,
with depth, the C to N ratio goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I present this because I'm kind of
going back to that concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon-nitrogen ratio playing an influence
in selective absorption of VOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the optical characterization,
now we're looking at the more molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the specific UV absorbance at 254.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that with both of these soils,
there's a decrease in the SUVA 254 with
[SPEAKER_00]: depth, suggesting that the dissolved
organic matter becomes less aromatic in
[SPEAKER_00]: the subsoils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, in addition to the bulk and
the dissolved organic matter raw content,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see its molecular composition of the
dissolved organic matter also distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: is influenced by tillage somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get this surface homogeneity again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to talk about dissolved
organic matter fluorescence excitation
[SPEAKER_00]: emission matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: These look really scary, but they're
actually really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping to convince you of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dissolved organic matter samples,
again, they're complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of stuff in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways that water and soil
chemists like to characterize this is
[SPEAKER_00]: using this technique, which basically
probes the fluorescence emission of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved organic matter sample at step
excitation wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is, doing this, you can
create an excitation landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a fluorescence landscape, I guess I
should say, that's going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: differently based on the molecular
composition and source of the dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to generally break it up into
two classes, one of which is the less
[SPEAKER_00]: condensed aromatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is individual aromatic structures
within the dissolved organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this oftentimes takes on the forms of
things like aromatic proteins like
[SPEAKER_00]: tryptophan or phenylalanine, but also
nucleic acids and other organic acids also
[SPEAKER_00]: fluoresce similarly to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the more condensed aromatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably shooting myself in the
foot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the terms humic and
fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that do organic matter research,
you know that's like taboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the term that people use in
the literature for characterizing these
[SPEAKER_00]: types of structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are more condensed so they have
fused aromatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fluorescence is redshifted because
the homo-lumo gap is altered by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another story for another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at these maps for the
dissolved organic matter fractions that
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate from these cores, we can see some
pretty cool trends going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one that occurred at every single site
in all these cores with depth is we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the fluorescent behavior that
corresponds with condensed aromatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's with depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those features are removed as we go
further down the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what becomes relatively more
pronounced are these more microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: product type fluorescence landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one last thing I'd like to point out
is, yet again, tillage really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: punctuates this transition quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so those are the main points here
I wanted to kind of get to with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'm going to summarize my
field-based work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the known kind of
textbook trends in bulk carbon and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen content of till and no-till
soils, we see that dissolved organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter content reflects that, where we see
the surface homogeneity within the plow
[SPEAKER_00]: layer followed by this quick drop-off in
the tilled system and more of a slow kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gradual decline where there's no
tillage being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the characteristics of the
dissolved organic matter, they follow a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty similar trend with that surface
heterogeneity, quick punctuation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that when we look at the
molecular characteristics of the dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, the carbon to nitrogen
ratio increases with depth, aromaticity
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down with depth, and the presence of
more condensed aromatic structure goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down with depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of has the fingerprint of
selective adsorption of DOM as it
[SPEAKER_00]: percolates throughout the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: These features in and of themselves do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this little hitch here has me thinking
a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because soluble microbial products,
things like proteins, nucleic acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to adsorb pretty readily in
soils as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which makes me wonder if perhaps lower in
these soil profiles where we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: high reactive mineral surface area and
very little organic carbon, if the biota
[SPEAKER_00]: that are down there are perhaps releasing
things into the soil solution that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of dominating the dynamic down
there as opposed to selective adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this kind of high reactive mineral
surface area protein nucleic acid mindset,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump in now to my laboratory
studies looking at the interactions of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomolecules with mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit, one more quick piece of
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys have seen this model
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Angela showed it during her talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a model that was proposed by
Marcus Kleber and Associates about a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of constructed this
hypothetical model here to help explain
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the multi-layer organic matter
associations we see in soil profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they built off of this observation
that biomolecules interact strongly with
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this model, multi-layer formation
is hinging upon the presence of this
[SPEAKER_00]: contact that is supposedly a biomolecule
rich directly at the mineral surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: a biomolecule rich layer, excuse me,
that forms when biomolecules adsorb
[SPEAKER_00]: directly on the mineral surface,
undergo conformational rearrangements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then more organic matter can absorb on
top of them forming the multi-layers
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to stabilization in this
multi-layered type architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biomolecules are really important,
believed to be important for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, one thing I'd like to point out
is the conformational rearrangements are
[SPEAKER_00]: believed to make this all possible,
so are also really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk more about the confirmation
in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to probe this question experimentally
in the lab, I utilized a few models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a model protein, a bovine serum
albumin, and I used a model DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the protein I used, bovine serum
albumin, is a globular protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a secondary structure that is
largely composed of alpha helices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's these really tightly-wound
regions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are connected by these long,
extended chains that are more extended and
[SPEAKER_00]: open-type structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also some more internalized
turn-type elements there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the DNA that was used comes from
herring testes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a standard physicochemical
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: For DNA experiments, it's a
double-stranded B-form of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, when you pick up a bottle of
herring testes DNA, what's in there is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a really long size distribution of
DNA right out of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I decided I'm going to
shear this to a known size, because size
[SPEAKER_00]: can be an important factor in looking at
absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to shear it to a known size
with a relatively tight size distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: to eliminate that as an influencing factor
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for both these biomolecules,
I think it's important to point out that
[SPEAKER_00]: under my experimental conditions of
5-millimolar KCl background at pH 5,
[SPEAKER_00]: these biomolecules are both going to have
a negative charge on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a net negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both will still have regions of positive
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used two different model mineral
surfaces, one of which is
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium-saturated montmorillonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used good old SWY2 bentonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that have worked with this
before, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 2 to 1 aluminosilicate clay
mineral, meaning it has two of these
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahedral units, or layers, I should
say, as shown by this brownish color,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one octahedral sheet as shown here by
the gray layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this specific montmorillonite,
bentonite, has a permanent negative
[SPEAKER_00]: structural charge that's situated in that
central octahedral layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that imparts a certain shrink-swell
behavior to this clay that gives it a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice high reactive surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike the montmorillonite,
I used another mineral called gotite,
[SPEAKER_00]: named after the German poet and hobby
geologist Goethe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an iron oxyhydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the montmorillonite, this is not
negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is positively charged at the pH
values used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similar to the montmorillonite,
it has a very high reactive surface area,
[SPEAKER_00]: as one could predict from looking at the
mineral structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an SEM image of the minerals
that I used in my experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell they're quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They range from maybe a few hundred
nanometers up to a couple of microns in
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very, very thin, so they have
a nice high reactive surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at biomolecule
adsorption to a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomolecules are kind of complicated to
study the surface behavior of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like other molecules that absorb the
surfaces, they have adsorption rate
[SPEAKER_00]: constants that can be informative about
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have equilibrium surface coverages
that can also be informative as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be informative about the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have this tendency to undergo
conformational adjustments that I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: alluded to earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, when we're going to study the
adsorption, we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be able to do so without
having to dry the system, which could
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially change the conformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do so without making the
system get too hot, too salty,
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything else that's going to make it
kind of artificially conform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do this, I use a technique known as
in situ attenuated total reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
so that one 10 times fast, or ATR FTIR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a form of vibrational
spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can probably tell from looking at
those cheesy little cartoons right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what separates this from other forms
of vibrational spectroscopy, like
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional infrared, is this ATR part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has what is called an internal
reflective element in which the infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: light is shined into this one internal
reflective element.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a diamond one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's reflected off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it's reflected, it's not a totally
efficient reflection, as nothing truly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get this loss of energy upon
reflection that is propagated
[SPEAKER_00]: perpendicularly from the surface of this
diamond that allows us to use it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling surface, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did for my experiments is I
coated the diamond in a mineral film and
[SPEAKER_00]: watched as the biomolecules absorbed to
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this technique, I was able to get
absorption kinetic data, equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: surface coverage stuff, some mechanistic
conformational information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to do this in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to worry about compounding
factors there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm going to move on to some
of my studies looking at the association
[SPEAKER_00]: of the protein BSA with the clay
montmorillonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an infrared spectrum of BSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has three features you're going to
typically see in FTIR spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the AMID-1, 2, and 3 peaks that
correspond with backbone vibrations on the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my studies, I'm going to show
results from the AMID-1 and 2 regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the AMID-1 region contains all of the
structural info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I'm going to look and say,
hey, the protein, is it unfolding or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: AMID-2, this is going to be my quantifying
region for BSA absorption on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's shown here is kind of a time
series of BSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the BSA absorbs, it gives a higher
and higher and higher signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go ahead and plot our AMID-2 peak
here against time, we can look at our
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the four different concentrations
used in this study, you can see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption kinetics follow a certain
logarithmic time dependence that suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: that the energetic barriers associated
with absorption are heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a single activation energy
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a distribution of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not entirely evident just from
these curves, but I'll show why I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is likely attributable to continuous
protein rearrangement on the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein lateral interactions with other
adsorbed proteins, or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: electrostatic heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at our equilibrium surface
coverage results, we can see that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: fit reasonably well by this black line
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the classic Langmuir adsorption
isotherm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing I want to point out
here is this model has a built-in k value,
[SPEAKER_00]: which corresponds with the kind of the
affinity or the strength of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this number here,
5.97 times 10 to the fifth, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the protein, as we are kind of already
more or less new, absorbs really strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: to the clay surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it absorbs, and the kinetics are
logarithmic, but what about the structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the conformation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we first consider here the native
secondary structure of the BSA,
[SPEAKER_00]: as shown by these dotted lines,
we see again it's primarily alpha helices
[SPEAKER_00]: with some more extended chains and turns
kind of mixed into the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the secondary
structure of the BSA on montmorillonite,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that a few things are happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily, I'd like to draw your attention
to this lowest concentration and
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding surface coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this value, it seems that BSA indeed
unfolds, and we see an increase in these
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded kind of extended chains and
turn-type structures that are more open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes at the expense of more
condensed alpha helical regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, as we look at the BSA
adsorbed at higher concentrations and
[SPEAKER_00]: surface coverages, it starts to look more
and more like native BSA in terms of its
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these values are all from equilibrium,
so that's the very end of my experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, does the protein adsorb
in this way and stay there, or does it
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorb and kind of flop around and find
the energetically most favorable state on
[SPEAKER_00]: the mineral surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to address this question, I use a
technique known as 2D correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroscopic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to get into the details
of this right now, but if you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: any questions about it, I would love,
love, love to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technique makes use of what is known
as a synchronous and an asynchronous plot
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at sequential changes to the
protein structure with adsorption time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we apply this analysis to the
data that I have, we see that there are at
[SPEAKER_00]: least two different conformational
pathways that we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is at the lowest BSA concentration
where the protein adsorbs, and with time
[SPEAKER_00]: we see an increase in open structures here
and the loss of the more compact alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: helices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the higher BSA concentrations,
the sequence looks a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that as the protein is on the
surface, we actually see an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregated strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of intermolecular
structures, but higher surface coverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of makes sense, have more
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a decrease in these more open turns
and extended chains with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two pathways that are
occurring there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One where the BSA adsorbs and becomes more
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one where it adsorbs and becomes
more compact and internalized with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to quickly summarize this
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is evident from these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: BSA does adsorb pretty strongly on clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we already kind of knew that as a
scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this really demonstrated,
though, is that not only does the
[SPEAKER_00]: conformation change, but it's a dynamic
conformation on the surface and is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic pathway that differs based on the
surface coverages themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where at the lowest BSA concentrations
used, the BSA adsorbs, and opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the higher concentrations,
it adsorbs and becomes more aggregated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to move on to some more
studies that I've done with BSA and DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: this time on another mineral surface,
the gore-tight, the more needle-looking
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that, I'm going to quickly
show an FTIR spectrum of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a vibrational spectrum of DNA
in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to the protein, we see some
vibrational modes that are attributable to
[SPEAKER_00]: backbone vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the phosphodiester groups from
these phosphonate groups, the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphodiester groups here, the stretching
asymmetric and symmetric modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some carbon-oxygen and
carbon-carbon stretching from the backbone
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to the AMID2 of protein,
I use this backbone carbon-carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching mode as my quantifier for DNA
adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've verified this using another
technique, so it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the results here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start off with the BSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I'd like to point out,
I'm now working on units of mass-based
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration rather than molarity to make
the correspondence between the protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the kinetics here look a little
bit different than they did on
[SPEAKER_00]: montmorillonite, especially at the lower
concentrations used, wherein we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sigmoidal logistic-type curve that
corresponded to these adsorption kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this lag phase that is this
kinetics have built into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the protein literature with surface
adsorption, this lag phase corresponds
[SPEAKER_00]: with a kind of cooperative clustering
effect of the protein on the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the kinetics are really,
really slow until we get a certain base
[SPEAKER_00]: layer surface coverage, in which case it
really kind of starts to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice when we go to higher
concentrations, that isn't quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, on the other hand, these are the
adsorption kinetics for DNA on grotite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of follow a classic first-order
adsorption, meaning the adsorption is
[SPEAKER_00]: rate-limited by energetic barriers as
opposed to mass transfer or some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: clustering effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, it's a single energetic
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we look at the equilibrium
isotherms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both VSA and DNA have pretty good
high-affinity isotherms here, as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell from the shapes of the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty apparent when you look at
the affinity coefficients that come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Langmuir equation here that DNA tends
to adsorb quite a bit more strongly,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I'll kind of link in
the next slide or two to the structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: the adsorbed DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conformation, what happens to the
conformation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like montmorillonite, where we see
unfolding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the trends are fairly
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the lowest concentration of
VSA used, we see something quite similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we see an unfolding of the VSA,
an opening up of extended chains at the
[SPEAKER_00]: expense of more condensed alpha helices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the higher concentrations used,
we can see that, again, it looks more like
[SPEAKER_00]: native VSA than much of the
montmorillonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For DNA, we can see some very clear direct
evidence that there's bond formation
[SPEAKER_00]: between DNA and the grotite.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece of evidence is these XPS spectra
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to get into the details
of XPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: In essence, this peak shift here,
about 0.7 electron volts, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus spectrum is in line with what
you'd see for like a phosphate adsorption
[SPEAKER_00]: on para hydride or something, which
corresponds really clearly with an
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-sphere coordination between this
phosphodiester group on the backbone and
[SPEAKER_00]: the grotite surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the infrared spectra of DNA
adsorbed and in solution, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: further evidence for direct inter-sphere
coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in solution, there's kind of this
valley here between these peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when DNA adsorbs, we get this nice big
peak that pops up at 1010 wave numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look in the literature here,
this corresponds really strongly with
[SPEAKER_00]: computational studies that have shown that
there's most likely an iron-oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus stretching bond forming there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further evidence for this is if we
look at higher energies at the asymmetric
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching modes of the backbone
phosphodiester group, we see a shift of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 7 or 8 wave numbers upon adsorption
to a lower energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, this shift here could
also be indicative of a conformational
[SPEAKER_00]: change of DNA from the B form that it
initially started in to a more expanded
[SPEAKER_00]: optically different Z form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look elsewhere in the spectrum
of DNA, we don't see any of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators that a Z form has indeed popped
up, suggesting that DNA adsorbs in the B
[SPEAKER_00]: form and doesn't necessarily undergo any
conformational changes, but we do get this
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-sphere bond forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to quickly wrap this up, both BSA and
DNA do adsorb strongly on gore-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some differences in the
kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: BSA, at the low concentrations,
has this kind of lag phase, whereas DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: just straight up first order all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confirmationally, it looks like BSA,
again, does kind of unfold on these
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces at lower concentrations,
at least, or surface coverages,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas higher surface coverage is not so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: For DNA, no large kind of long-order
conformational change seems to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, there is an inter-sphere
bond that appears to occur between the
[SPEAKER_00]: backbone phosphodiester group and the
gore-type surface, and this is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, strong, stable bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the angstrom component in this
work, so I've got to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a direct bond forming there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we mix them together in
solution, and we look and see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorb when they're together?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one could very easily build up the
argument based on the kinetic results
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's that lag phase in the
protein, and the equilibrium isotherms
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have this real nice higher
affinity with the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could easily say we're going to put
them both together, and DNA is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: preferentially adsorb on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to spoil anything too
much, but when you mix molecules together
[SPEAKER_00]: in solution, you have a tendency to
undergo what is called supermolecular
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really important for two
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main reasons is as molecules in
solution spontaneously assemble to form
[SPEAKER_00]: these aggregates, the properties of the
constituent biomolecules change a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very interesting to see how that
could possibly translate to the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior of the mineral surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there haven't been too many studies
leading up to this that have demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing that's really important
about this is we've known for decades,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, that supermolecular assembly
does occur in dissolved organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst those components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has more than a wee bit of
environmental relevance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these studies, what I did is I made
a series of supermolecular complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were made by using a fixed DNA
concentration, and it was titrated with
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts of protein in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once these complexes were formed,
I characterized the extent to which they
[SPEAKER_00]: bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: How strongly do they associate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I characterized the charge characteristics
of the complexes relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: constituent biomolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the complexes themselves,
and I said, hey, how are you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: I characterized that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at some of the results here,
this is kind of the extent of binding here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an equilibrium binding curve
between protein and DNA as derived from a
[SPEAKER_00]: technique called circular dichroism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two main things I'd like to
draw your attention to here, one of which
[SPEAKER_00]: is the shape of the binding curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it has that S shape that we saw for
the kinetic of protein absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that there is some
cooperativity amongst the proteins bound
[SPEAKER_00]: to the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when one adsorbs or binds, it's more
likely to make further binding more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing here is the binding
saturation is reached on the DNA at a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein-DNA ratio of about 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, when we add more protein
to the system, it's not binding directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to the DNA because we've reached a
saturation on the DNA helix itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the K value that comes out of this is
really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the order of five or six times 10
to the fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put it up here because it's not
quantitatively usable, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a strong underestimate of the
real case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is proof that this binding is quite
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the charge characteristics of
the complexes are fairly unique as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting with DNA that has a
relatively high electrophoretic mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means it has a large negative
charge on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BSA is up here just below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not quite as negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just got a little bit of negative
charge at this pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that as we combine them and
make complexes of mixed BSA-DNA ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: the negative charge in the complexes goes
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we change the charge characteristics
here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do these complexes interact in
solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where a technique known as dynamic
light scattering comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a set of light scattering curves
here, light scattering distributions,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have relaxation time on the
x-axis, arbitrary intensity on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have here is DNA with
increasing amounts of BSA added to the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and BSA by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main features I'd like to draw
your attention to on these relaxation time
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the fast relaxation mode peak of
DNA, which corresponds with the diffusion
[SPEAKER_00]: of individual DNA helices through
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a higher diffusion time
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's this slow relaxation mode,
which is a concerted diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that DNA helices in the
solution at this pH have a negative charge
[SPEAKER_00]: on them from electrophoretic mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative charges have a tendency to kind
of repel each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we have a lot of these DNA helices
in solution, they're kind of afraid to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything because they can't get too close
or too far from anything because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by negative charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an analogy I like to use to kind of
conceptualize this is that of the jet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here are a couple of McDonald
Douglas FA-18 Hornets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these jets, I looked this up earlier,
when you have one of these as is and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going full throttle, these things can go
about 1,300 miles per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're flying in formation,
as the blue angels are here, they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have to slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going full throttle,
it's much more difficult for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: maneuver and control themselves with
respect to their neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get too close or very bad
things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA in solution is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mass, the en masse diffusion of the
DNA is a lot slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what creates this slow
relaxation mode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, as we add BSA to the
system, a few things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is this slow mode peak that
corresponds with the diffusion of
[SPEAKER_00]: individual DNA helices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shifts to higher relaxation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a slower diffusion of the molecule
in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go back and look at the
Stokes-Einstein equation from which these
[SPEAKER_00]: curves are derived, that's most likely a
higher mass that's making this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, the slow mode peak that
arises from this intermolecular repulsion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the DNA is really, really, really
dampened as we add BSA to the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that there's a breakdown in
that intermolecular repulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one last thing I'd like to point out
on these light scatterers and other
[SPEAKER_00]: results is even when we get above this
finding saturation of DNA, BSA that's
[SPEAKER_00]: added isn't free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see this free translational
diffusion of BSA here, suggesting that the
[SPEAKER_00]: BSA is still kind of under the influence
of these complexes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll quickly recap here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add BSA to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make complexes that grow larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The negative charge on the complexes
becomes lesser and lesser as we add
[SPEAKER_00]: protein to the system, likely through
electrostatic interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: positively charged domains on the protein
and or side chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this happens, the electrostatic
repulsion between the complexes breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we add protein to the system,
even above binding saturation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the BSA isn't free, and it's still in
loose association with the complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when we take these
complexes and absorb them on the surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a set of FTIR spectra from one of
my adsorption experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that as the complexes
absorb the protein component, AMID2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my DNA quantifier is back on CC mode,
we can see them both clearly with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the composition of the
adsorb material with time at these lower
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental ratios, it's more or less
pretty flat, suggesting that the
[SPEAKER_00]: speciation of the adsorb material doesn't
exhibit any discrimination in the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes of this kind of adsorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a different situation,
though, when we move to the highest ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is above saturation point on the
binding curve, wherein we see an early dip
[SPEAKER_00]: in the protein to DNA ratio of what's
adsorbed, suggesting that early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption process, kinetically speaking,
we have more protein adsorbed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with time, it kind of stabilizes,
but it still results in an equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: protein DNA value that is
disproportionately large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests to me that maybe we're
getting some early dissociation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes, and the proteins that are
peripherally associated with these
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes are rapidly adsorbing initially
in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then perhaps the complexes without the
peripherally adsorbed protein will then
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the equilibrium results,
if we look at the amount of DNA adsorbed,
[SPEAKER_00]: as, again, shown by this backbone cc peak,
we can see that the amount of DNA adsorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: as we add protein to the system actually
goes up, which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One might think more biomolecules,
more competition for surface sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily the case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe this is attributable to the
electrostatic repulsion that is reduced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the addition of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DNA adsorption on surfaces is
oftentimes limited by the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: electrostatic footprint of the DNA helix,
because we know they don't like to get
[SPEAKER_00]: close to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physics doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take these complexes and we add
BSA to the system and we make them less
[SPEAKER_00]: repulsive to each other, the surface is
able to accommodate more DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this isn't always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we move to the concentrations of BSA
that go beyond what the DNA itself can
[SPEAKER_00]: accommodate, we actually kind of see this
sharp drop-off again, suggesting to me
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe those kinetic results are
really onto something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're getting some blocking of
surface sites by quickly adsorbing protein
[SPEAKER_00]: that's preventing complexes from adsorbing
beyond that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one last piece of result I would like
to talk about real quick here is this
[SPEAKER_00]: chart here at the bottom showing the peak
height of the FeOP peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the extent of direct
coordination divided by the cc peak
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the extent of direct
coordination per DNA molecule in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we add BSA to the DNA, we see that the
extent of direct coordination per adsorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks to me that the BSA somehow is
blocking direct coordination of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphodiester groups with the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether this is through a direct
interaction of the BSA, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: electrostatically, with the phosphodiester
groups, or if it's more of a steric type
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking, simply preventing the groups
from even touching the surface is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain yet, but it seems to me
that that's what's going on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating kind of a protein bridge between
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll quickly wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that under the experimental
conditions used, BSA and DNA, they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get very involved with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind very strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that this solution behavior
simply as predicted from the equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: binding behavior, it propagates itself in
so many interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly in solution where you can
see the intermolecular characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: the complexes are going to be altered
greatly by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrostatic characteristics are
influenced greatly by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think perhaps most importantly for
the thinking about soil organic matter and
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior of biomolecules in the
environment has a pretty big impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: what goes on at the interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the binding mechanism and the amount
of at least the DNA that are adsorbed is
[SPEAKER_00]: altered greatly by this interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you guys can remember back
to that, the Claiborne model that I
[SPEAKER_00]: presented that had the multi-layer
biomolecule formation on the mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, those guys thought that
biomolecules would adsorb, and then you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have another adsorb and then another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this work kind of demonstrates
that's not necessary in situations where
[SPEAKER_00]: we have supermolecular association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite possible that a multi-layer of
material could form in a single adsorption
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to quickly summarize the bulk
of everything and hopefully still have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to take a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our field studies, tillage seems to
have a pretty big impact on DOM dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's surface inversion, especially on
the downstream processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question I think was more or less
kind of addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes both the amount of DOM
and also the characteristics of DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the characteristics in the
amount, it's reasonable to assume that,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, adsorbative fractionation could be
the culprit here for the removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some hitches in there that
suggest that in subsoils, it might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: source driven by perhaps more resident
microbial communities or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we kind of hone in on this region
down here, we have a lot of reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral surface area and microbial
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do some cool experimental lab
studies at the molecular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned quite a few things there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that not only do biomolecules
absorb the surfaces and change
[SPEAKER_00]: conformation, we knew that, but it's kind
of a continuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a constant energetic struggle of
these biomolecules on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that, at least with the case of BSA
on montmorillonite, and I suspect some
[SPEAKER_00]: other proteins as well, the pathway with
which that occurs is going to change with
[SPEAKER_00]: surface coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, conformational and actual
bonding type interactions drive a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the associations you see with geratite as
well with those mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one final thing that we see is that
when we combine these biomolecules in
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, they interact in strange ways
and they change the way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents are retained at the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a broad overview of what
I just presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to quickly wrap up with some
acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my present lab group.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, my advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long, strange ride,
but she's always given me really great
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor helped me out with getting some of
the dissolved carbon and nitrogen data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past lab group members, when I was
still at Penn State, they really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me understand just the basics of
being a grad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are super valuable, and I didn't
realize that until after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My committee members, far, far,
far too many other friends and colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: to name drop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot in the audience, and I
appreciate you showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My funding sources, obviously,
and you guys, the audience, for being
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I have time to take a couple
quick questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the C to N ratio of dissolved organic
matter in the field is increasing with
[SPEAKER_01]: depth, that would imply that it possibly
could imply that in the surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting preferential absorption of
higher nitrogen-containing compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then the expectation would be that
microbial products surely would be more in
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface than the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was the opposite of what you showed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that maybe, at least in terms
of the dissolved fraction, what was being
[SPEAKER_00]: shown, I think it might be driven more by
microbial processing and byproducts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: subsoil itself, rather than being
transported from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done any studies to go beyond
that and really kind of probe it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that was kind of a result that
my first instinct was the same as yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like microbial activity is much more
pronounced in the surface going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done anything to really follow
up on that too much yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the fluorescence as
itself isn't super, super strong at
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't actually change the
characteristics that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the circular dichroism that I used to
characterize the binding equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get DNA conformational information
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the peak that I was using,
I was looking at the change in the molar
[SPEAKER_00]: absorptivity of that peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a peak that's associated with the
actual B form of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't seem like it was being
altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, it got higher and higher
because the absorptivity was increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other indicator peaks like A or Z form
didn't seem to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And single-stranded DNA don't absorb
circularly polarized light at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a feature of the double-stranded
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I wish I had more
time to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely look further into those
direct interactions that are going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there and really kind of understand that
morphology a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically with respect to the proteins,
I believe that those are unfolding to some
[SPEAKER_00]: extent once they bind to the DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, proteins, I mean, that's how DNA
opens itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as a mechanism in our cells for,
I mean, actually, some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are proteins that are made to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nonspecific interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a more definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, based on a circular dichroism,
I have no reason to believe it's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BSA is cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in some cow blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a byproduct of slaughterhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these studies use a lot of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to use something like lacase
or something initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to kind of get the kind of
quantities I would need to run these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies with kind of purity I would need
for a molecular level experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it became cost prohibitive very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, there's a whole range
of soil proteins in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes sizes and charge
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think calling any single one a really
great model, I think, unless I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at a specific process, I think it's a
little bit short-sighted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to go with something that's
real broad, quick and dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reviewers, when I submitted this paper to
the ES&T, the reviewers had a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: set of concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it's true that we'll have
to sort of figure out some of these little
[SPEAKER_02]: experimental, whether or not there are
other research subjects that might work
[SPEAKER_02]: with BSA or just something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BSA is a fairly common physicochemical
model, I think, for the reasons I
[SPEAKER_00]: explained that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always joke with people that ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, it's relevant under a dead cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dead cow is going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to release the serum proteins
in the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's kind of my reason for doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of other people use it
probably for very similar reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so well-studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have to, for example,
the secondary structure, I didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through a long, rigorous
crystallography experiment to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's already been really well-studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to verify my FTIR results
with that pretty cleanly, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, so why do you use a model?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one, historically, the earlier
studies on protein-soil-middle
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions, before you have these fancy
instruments, you have these things that
[SPEAKER_02]: have an appropriate analysis of this
protein, these previous studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do you use a model?
[SPEAKER_02]: A question there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the accessibility, particularly with
respect to DNA, is a topic of vast
[SPEAKER_00]: research interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's commonly kind of understood that
mineral surfaces, to an extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of protect DNA in a lot of ways from
microbial alteration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the influence of the processes
themselves on the presence of microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once the microbes are there and
they're exuding these kind of compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of opens up the door for them
being a little more relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the general paradigm right now
is that once molecules are absorbed on
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, there's some degree of
protection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I probably didn't answer your
question thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But microbes still probably want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would love to get their hands on
them, but they're bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: These mechanisms, I think, direct bond
formation, and you get actual unfolding,
[SPEAKER_00]: which increases contact points between the
biomolecule and the mineral surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it just makes a lot of it really
inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you get energetically tough to get
those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the same reasons they love to get
on there, they're tough to get back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just these vast releases of
Gibbs free energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a quick question regarding the
employing of electrolytes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been told the experiments were done
with the phosphor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could imagine if you had to multiply
it higher, especially with respect to DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: and mineral extraction, that it would
influence, it would essentially change the
[SPEAKER_02]: strings of part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to know if you could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the literature, what I've seen on
that, and this makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if we were to get, I'll answer
your question first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think super molecular association would
not occur when we get further and further
[SPEAKER_00]: and further away from the isoelectric
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the molecules become more
electrostatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're statically repulsive to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're less likely to get close.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be one situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In situations of high ionic strength as
well, things tend to disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes biomolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the local charges that could form,
that could be an attractive force,
[SPEAKER_00]: might be disrupted by the presence of more
cations in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can disrupt those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be some of the situations I'm
thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, and it would also depend on the
identity of the biomolecules too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if there's a real good
clean answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would depend a lot on the identity of
cations, on the identity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomolecules themselves, the super
molecular components within that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the surface behavior is
concerned, let's say we were to use
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium in the DNA study instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'd probably see a higher
affinity for the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, for DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's asking about DNA specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, electrostatically,
DNA doesn't really want to go near each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of one of the limiting
factors of absorption on surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do something like add calcium to
the system, you can kind of stabilize some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those negative charges that are on the
DNA backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been studies that have come
out of a group in China that have shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the presence of something like
magnesium or calcium, it tends to enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: the absorption of DNA on surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could, especially with clay minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
