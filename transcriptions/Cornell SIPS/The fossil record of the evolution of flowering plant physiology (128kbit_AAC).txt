[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great being here so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun being in a plant biology
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in earth science departments my
whole career, and it's been very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to so many actual botanists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though there's a lot of plant
biology in this room, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to explain why I'm a plant
biologist and what I think of my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it very well may be different from
the way a lot of people think about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, the real draw for plants primarily
is the fact that they have cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an awful lot falls out of that as far
as what you can do with them as fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fossil that's 300 million years
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snails are just shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant in between is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all this anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that plants are largely physical
creatures involved in conducting water and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on, we can actually say a lot about how
this thing functioned based upon having
[SPEAKER_00]: that anatomy present.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original cell walls are preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That biochemistry is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk about the evolution of
different biochemical cell wall compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, perhaps less immediately,
but also very importantly, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: have cell walls, there's no cell
migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their development is much simpler than
what you'd expect to see in an animal with
[SPEAKER_00]: gastrulation and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at the final adult
morphology and say something about how it
[SPEAKER_00]: got there in a much more direct way than
you could with an animal and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, plants are all trying to
make their living the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nearly all aspects of land plant form
has evolved multiple times convergently
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lots of independent experiments
looking at the evolution of different
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this phylogeny of living
vascular plants here, the lineages make it
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the Devonian and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, if you know what these guys
are, it looks like there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological continuity there as far as
roots and leaves and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the common ancestors of these lineages
are very small and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of what it looks like these
things might share has actually evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we can directly
assess from the fossil record,
[SPEAKER_00]: where all these guys have leaves that look
kind of ferny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we look at slightly older members of
those lineages, and you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but these things slightly older.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be leaves at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually trace the evolution of
these things and compare multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutions of very similar structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, something that has taken me
many years to really fully appreciate,
[SPEAKER_00]: that animals are cute, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're scary, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants, they're the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the hydrologic cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the water in the atmosphere,
plants are climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the evolution of these guys and the
evolution of their physiology really is
[SPEAKER_00]: the evolution of the Earth's surface in a
very direct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a whole lot of turnover
through time in what those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turnover matters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of focus on this kind of
turnover down there with the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're really kind of passive
recipients of a world that these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: making for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my heart of hearts lies down here in
the Paleozoic and all the crazy beasts
[SPEAKER_00]: that are down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to focus on these guys,
the flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am not an angiosperm person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They scare me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are far, far, far too many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an angiosperm person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that has some utility,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking from the outside in towards the
angiosperms can give you some perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: on what it is that they're doing
differently that it's harder to see from
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully, if I have enough time,
understanding what's going on here also
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects back on what's going on back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my primary kind of entry into the
fossil record has always been leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, I was interested in leaf
development and how we can use venation
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns to say something about where
growth is occurring within these leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structures, how laminate surfaces evolve
multiple times, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing that in my thesis and so on
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use venation patterns to say
something about sequential appearances of
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology indicating sequential
appearances of different developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: modes showing up in multiple independent
lineages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, I got more interested in the
fact that these things are not just
[SPEAKER_00]: passive records of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also matter for how this thing is
functioning physiologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're conducting the water, and water
matters if you're a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got more interested in the
physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I did, I was amused by a basic
little lie in the way I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: presented this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might as well have been from my
thesis defense here indicating about how
[SPEAKER_00]: ferns can very closely converge upon
venation patterns seen in angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lie in the way I presented
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never presented that, which is that
they're not presented at the same scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were, they would look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more veins in the flower
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually is going to end up
mattering quite a bit for how these things
[SPEAKER_00]: can function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a plant, you're trying to do
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to take in carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere, and you cannot help
[SPEAKER_00]: but lose water in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to keep on taking in carbon
dioxide through your stomata, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to replace the water you're
losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cannot maintain that steady
state, you have to close the stomata,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to stop photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ability to move water very much
matters for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydraulic capacity is going to be very
strongly correlated with photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydraulic capacity of the whole plant
is very much tied up with the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the resistance of the entire
pathway of water through the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least half of it, sometimes 2 thirds or
more, is tied up in the last little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: that is represented by the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go up through the roots, up the stem,
out the branch, to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even within those centimeters,
that last couple centimeters, the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much resistance in the leaf is
actually tied to the last couple microns,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last millimeter or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the fact that throughout that
hydraulic pathway, water is moving through
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes designed for water transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's when they leave those pipes,
this is a cross section of a leaf here,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you leave the vasculature here,
to make it to the stomata, you're moving
[SPEAKER_00]: through tissue that is not designed for
hydraulic transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much of the resistance, as a result,
is tied up in that pathway through the
[SPEAKER_00]: mesofil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hydraulic conductance of the entire
plant is very much tied to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the leaf, it's really tied to
this path length from vein to stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything you can do to change that path
length is going to affect the hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity of the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest way to change that path
length is just to change the vein density.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more veins, those little blue
lines are going to be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum distance water has to travel
from the vein to the stomata is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to demonstrate that this really does
matter here, this is looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance from vein to stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shorter that distance is,
the higher the leaf conductance to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the higher the leaf conductance,
the higher the flow aesthetic rate that
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all very much tied to these
vein characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at distance from vein
to stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flip that around, you get vein
density, which is a much easier term to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just looking at the millimeters
of vein per square millimeter of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look at that here,
this is vein density versus maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there's a very good relationship
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the fun thing is that this is
something that is readily measurable in
[SPEAKER_00]: fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work with this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a living cycad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living cycads are very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would never impugn a triassic
cycad and say that, well, they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing slowly like the living cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all we know, these guys have been
displaced by the spread of angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they were more ecologically diverse
in the distant past before these
[SPEAKER_00]: transitions occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I looked at a variety of fossil
cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look like the living cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be stuck way down on this
spectrum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes a very powerful tool for
looking at the physiology of fossil plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and physiology through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at a whole bunch of
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first off, don't worry about the
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had to do with a specific argument
about leaf development and how that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be tied or not tied.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be tied to potential vein
densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pattern to look at here is the fact
that these guys down here, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plants, go way farther out on
this axis than anything else that has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this includes a lot of exclusively
extinct lineages of seed plants and so on,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as ferns up here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the best way to look at this is
this graph here, which is vein density
[SPEAKER_00]: through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vein density is incredibly stable in all
non-flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go down to about 1 millimeter of
vein per square millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of leaf surface, it can go up to around 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you get the evolution of flowering
plants, where the average is about 8 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, and it can go up to 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower bound is still the lower bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mean and the maximum is about four
times larger than any other group of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that has ever lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see what some of these guys
look like in practice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fairly typical flowering
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fairly typical fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even see the smallest veins
here, whereas you're seeing everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: that fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a talk once, and there was a
molecular biologist who even worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had seen these pictures of ferns
that I was putting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he assumed that there was more orders
of veins that he couldn't see that were
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and that I was just showing the
bigger veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all the veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is going to end up
mattering physiologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to pause, though,
and say that the veins are not magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a magic leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took one of these and stapled it to a
cycad, you would not get a magic,
[SPEAKER_00]: fast-growing cycad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would get a dead leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is doing is integrating a
lot of the whole biology of the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in a way that we can actually
then measure in fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get an illustration of that kind of
integration, I'm going to do a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent that will actually come back and
be important later on, where there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper that I was not involved in,
but the senior author here is Maciej
[SPEAKER_00]: Cianniski, who's a close colleague of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is they made artificial
leaves out of gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they carved little channels in them,
ran a tube to a balance, and they blew air
[SPEAKER_00]: over the surface and evaporated water from
the surface as an artificial leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were able to demonstrate is
that as you add more channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: more veins, the amount of water you lose
increases, but then it rapidly saturates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where that saturation occurs is going
to reflect the thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that optimal
placement of these veins, if you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to lose water, is when the distance
between the veins is the same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance from that vein to the evaporative
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more veins than that,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to flatline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this leads to expectations of what
leaves should look like in cross-section.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all, cartoons are all
cross-sections of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are good leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what leaves should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of veins, and they're
close together, this should be in a thin
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that D and the delta are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a thick leaf, you can have two
different systems going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these are merely placed, then you
should have a very low vein density.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could also have these things
offset, because what matters is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual thickness of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the distance from the veins to the
evaporative surface with the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are good leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are bad leaves that should not
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no point to having a lot of veins
if they're far from that evaporative
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, because that evaporative surface
can't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of wasteful,
the construction, the displacement of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic tissue, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, this should be a problem,
because the tissue immediately in between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two veins should dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be getting enough water at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you should actually be kind of
actively killing stuff down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have expectations of what leaves
should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they went out, and they measured
a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, that's a biological paper,
and they get a relationship that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one-to-one line that they
wanted, and everything is right there on
[SPEAKER_00]: the one-to-one line, from thin leaves down
here to thick leaves up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw this, when this came out,
this was when I was first kind of sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: down and measuring vein density a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I was doing with my time
for a while there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this paper immediately bothered me,
because there was a big problem with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that problem was was,
where are the ferns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferns have thin leaves, and they have very
low vein densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should be plotting out here,
not on that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Monty very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very good scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a theory about what was going
on, which was that the authors were all
[SPEAKER_00]: either hydraulic physiologists or actual
physicists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably just went out and grabbed a
bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on a university campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grabbed stuff, and they measured
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, you're sampling this kind
of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I suspected was going on was that
it was not just a simple line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a slightly more complicated
relationship for these different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf types.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the good leaves here on the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the bad leaves I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bad leaf should just never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over-investing veins, there's no reason to
ever do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this could exist, as long as you live
in a sheltered environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I suspected went on in this
original paper and how they got such a
[SPEAKER_00]: good relationship is they were only
sampling out here, as far as degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those things are going to be
one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you got things living in the shade
and wet environments and so on,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you're going to find the
ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went and we sampled a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first thing to say about this is
that is a really glorious triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really did get the hydraulics right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't on that first paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they really did get it right,
because there really is nothing below that
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one-to-one line really is what matters
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a very good indication that
they really did do the hydraulics right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we do fill in a triangle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing what all those different
symbols are, there really is an ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient there, where the things in
exposed environments are on the line and
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that fall off the line are
going to be in much more sheltered
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even gradients within the
ferns and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw what we expected to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also saw something that I didn't
really anticipate, which is there's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: separation of different phylogenetic
lineages as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already mentioned the ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there's an ecological gradient
here, where the ferns down there are tree
[SPEAKER_00]: ferns in exposed environments and so on,
versus guys that are in deeper shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of them can be very good,
although they can be better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gymnosperms also have low vein densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can have thicker leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can end up actually kind of
grading onto this line by virtue of having
[SPEAKER_00]: very thick leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there is also this ecological
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not showing the data, but all the
fossils we looked at are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent with that, suggesting that the
ecologies that we're seeing in these
[SPEAKER_00]: living guys are consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ferns have always been ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cycads have always been cycads,
ecologically, as far as what they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set up this system where the canopy
and smaller trees and more open
[SPEAKER_00]: environments are going to have these
thicker leaves on these various seed plant
[SPEAKER_00]: lineages that are capable of doing that,
whereas these guys are going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted to these sheltered
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then all the angiosperms we looked at
violated that in a very interesting way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where you are
ecologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The angiosperms are on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep shade angiosperms are also on the
line, even though they don't have to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very interesting to think about
their evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that's derived angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the red angiosperms, they look like
the ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across the basal angiosperm phylogeny,
they start out all looking kind of very
[SPEAKER_00]: ferny in these relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they get on that line,
and we're derived angiosperms,
[SPEAKER_00]: they stay there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that here, this is
plotting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just looking at the ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't know where you are on this
line, but you know how far off the line
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody here, the furniture up here,
they're not so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The various gymnosperms are slightly
better, but not so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once all this is the angiosperms,
Anita, basal guys, this whole backbone is
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the core eudicots, and the derived
monocots, and specifically the laurelis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the magnolia and laurelis are better
than the pyprolis and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the backbone of this would have been
very poorly optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's several independent lineages
within the flowering plants that figure
[SPEAKER_00]: this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been kind of this stable system
through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that can tolerate being in open
exposed environments versus the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that couldn't, but could handle these more
sheltered circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the angiosperms came along and
completely violated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these things, their thin leaves,
would have been capable of a lot of gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange, but didn't necessarily have a
lot of need for that gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they could handle having so few
veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these guys are much thicker and
are therefore capable of much less gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're the ones that actually had the
light and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What angiosperms did was they figured out
how to take leaves that should have been
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shade and put them at the top of
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that basically only
they have figured out, which speaks to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of what they're doing and how
different it is biologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these aren't magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These really are integrating an awful lot
about the overall biology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the rest of this talk, I'm going to
explore what that actually means for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth, and for the plants, and the
ecosystems, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start out, I'm going to talk about this
climate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a graph I already showed you,
how vein density scales to maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly if you go to tropical
systems, recycling of rainfall can account
[SPEAKER_00]: for 30% to 50% of the rainfall that falls
on a rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants suck it up, put it back up in
the sky so it can fall down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing this kind of cloud seeding
over the forest in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's present over the forest,
not over the ocean in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying that those transpiration
capacities up here would not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: present before the evolution of flowering
plants in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the evolution of flowering plants
is relevant to thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of tropical rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not saying that flowering plants
invented rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will always be a tropical rainy
belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is stretching across the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the distribution of sea
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This always would have existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, if you have mountains near
a coastline, they can squeeze water out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there always would have been little
distributions of rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, angiosperms had to have evolved
in them based upon the ecology of basal
[SPEAKER_00]: extant lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did have to pre-exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, transpiration is important to
these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may very well have been important in
the spread of these things, depending upon
[SPEAKER_00]: how important that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question becomes, well,
how important is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I engaged with a post-doc, Jung Yun
Lee, who is a climate modeler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are part of climate models as they
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have physiological parameters in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we ended up doing is we just
turned the one knob that had to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: these physiological rates and looked at
what the outcome was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are standard models for
atmosphere and ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using modern circumstances, modern surface
temperatures, all we changed was the
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration capacity of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it mattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at the Amazon basin here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a difference map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's showing how much rainfall is lost
in the absence of flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the same biomass of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just changed the physiology of the
plants to a non-angiosperm mean average
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the center of that bullseye,
we're losing about 1,500 millimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall per year, which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at that temporally rather than
spatially, but this is still over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon basin, there's a variety of
interesting things to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue is present day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue versus the black shows how
closely the model corresponds to actual
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the absence of the flowering
plants, the basin is hotter and drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much more seasonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasonally, it's up to five degrees
hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the tail end of that dry
season, transpiration becomes very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latent sensible heat becomes very
important for cooling off the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets much, much hotter once you
turn off that transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hotter, we're drier, and we're
more seasonal in the absence of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants being present in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, the area of what gets defined
as ever what rainforest, based upon number
[SPEAKER_00]: of rainy days per year, drops by 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a rainforest band.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's much more confined to where the
ITCZ, that tropical rainy belt,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be situated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that massively expansive Amazon
basin that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm showing you the Amazon,
because that's where it works the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are global effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are less severe in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are less severe for fairly
obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is high topographically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the East African Plateau,
which constrains where you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to make Africa wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Southeast Asia is a bunch of
mountainous islands in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to make them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's reasons for why the impact is
less in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in Eastern North America,
it's still a 50% reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a different color, because
there's less overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still 50% of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's reason to think that what's
going on in the Amazon basin, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: is perhaps relevant to some things that
are going on in Earth history.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Eocene here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark hatching is distribution of
tropical aspect rainforest, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these things are at rather high
latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the fact that there was this kind
of extreme spread under these warm
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances in the Eocene may very well
have been related to the transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: capacities of that vegetation,
which was flower and plant dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way to think about that is this
was not the only time the Earth has been
[SPEAKER_00]: very warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back a little bit earlier,
oops, that's the wrong way,
[SPEAKER_00]: back to earlier in the Cretaceous,
it was also warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're talking about in North
America and so on is seasonal aridity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference is turnover and what
that vegetation was composed of,
[SPEAKER_00]: what those forest canopies would have been
created of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would have been much less
transpiration in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any case, if you just thought about the
physical nature of this world,
[SPEAKER_00]: this should have been the wetter world,
because this is when we had lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: internal seaways breaking up these
continents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pathway for moisture movement
should have been much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just based upon those reasons,
this should be wet and this should be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the opposite of what we
actually see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this could have been very
important earlier in Earth history,
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in the history of angiosperms in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also sets up a very interesting
dynamic, because plant diversity itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: tied to precipitation levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work of Creft and Yetz here,
where what they're showing is that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: potential evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of how warm it is,
how much water you could evaporate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is related to solar influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it shows is that looking at
diversity, in lots of localities around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it shows is that if you're cold,
getting warmer matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you're relatively warm,
getting warmer still doesn't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does make a difference is
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also where angiosperms are the
most hyperdiverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are creating the very environments
where much of their diversity is situated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're propagating them out much larger
than they otherwise would have been based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on physical parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that does matter also for animal
diversity and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at primate diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And animal diversity is also correlated
with rainfall abundance, evenness,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rainforest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the monkeys care that it's raining?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the monkeys care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they care about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terrestrial diversity as a whole is
going to be very much impacted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of this physiology that is
unique to the flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you can perhaps even see this
in other lineages of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fern phylogeny where the green
is evolution of epiphytic ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines there, you can't read that at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lines here represent the K-T
boundary, which is the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mesozoic, start of the cenozoic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering plants evolved around in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these lineages of epiphytic plants
are evolving after this transition to a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plant dominated world.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are the filmy ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's plenty of good reasons
to ignore them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look earlier in Earth's history,
where are the epiphytes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Triassic of Greenland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been the warmest,
consistently wet place at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tropics at that time were more
seasonally dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is as close as you're going to get
to a rainforest type situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of these plants have been
reconstructed as lianas or vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this may reflect this
transition where epiphytes are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very dependent upon the regularity of
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that regularity is going to be
buffered by the existence of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in these later time periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think their evolution has greatly
impacted climate in a way that then also
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts just diversity of both the plants
themselves and everybody else that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: along with them in these ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also, I think, going to be very
relevant for productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I showed graphs that were just very
clear cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity should scale with vein
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a lot more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bear with me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because productivity is also going to be
dependent upon other factors, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious of which is going to be
atmospheric CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has fluctuated quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually now in a very low level of
CO2 versus the distant past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that initial paper on vein density,
there was four of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all ex-patriots of Missy
Holbrook's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all post-docs at the same time
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of those authors were Tim Broadrib
and Taylor Field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went off and measured a whole
bunch of more angiosperms, more than I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever cared to do, because they're the
hardest things to measure, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they also kind of developed a
model over how this relates to carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide changes through time that I felt
was very problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they argued was that the effect
of vein density is going to saturate at
[SPEAKER_00]: high carbon dioxide concentrations so that
there's no advantage for high vein density
[SPEAKER_00]: when CO2 is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only as CO2 declined from the
Cretaceous to the present that suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: these high vein density values become
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when these things are
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they link the evolution of angiosperms
to declines in CO2 through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they talked about this in terms of a
big increase in photosynthetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of concerned by this model,
though, because the back end of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this graph here shows,
and it was just kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementals, was different crops versus
tropical trees versus non-angiosperms and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do in the modern world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's these big differences between
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sure, everything saturates at high
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have it saturating way the heck
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is saying is any crappy fern,
if you get enough CO2, it would be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more productive than mazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sunflowers are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that felt wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually fits into a larger
debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the debate happens at the rate of
paper every five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a variety of people have come out on
either side of this, where there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of people that are very invested
in carbon dioxide through time and wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to make this as the driver of much of
what's going on in evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the paper I was just talking
about, broader urban field, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of these others as well,
a lot of them led by David Bierling and
[SPEAKER_00]: his students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this focus on this extrinsic
driver of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other cases, and not always aware of
what they're arguing against, I certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't aware of it in some of the cases I
was arguing against this, are people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have focused much more on the intrinsic
biology of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best known of these would be
Bond's great paper about the tortoise and
[SPEAKER_00]: the hare and the differences in the
potential ecology of angiosperms versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was largely talking about conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can expand it beyond there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the same CO2 changes are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just no interest in
emphasizing that as far as what's driving
[SPEAKER_00]: the changes in the ecology through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that this model might be a
very interesting way to test some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the model they use is reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same photosynthetic models that
have been used since the early 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been very well vetted and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they found a way to include vein
density in it, which is another way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: at the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually set up some very
interesting tests here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They emphasize this flat line and why
there's no advantage to high vein density
[SPEAKER_00]: when CO2 is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't talk about, which I find
much more interesting, is just how steep
[SPEAKER_00]: this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no other plants besides the
angiosperms ever made it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any plant can do this within this pink
range here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is an extrinsic driver,
it should be affecting all plants equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's inherent in this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they have the ferns getting so
productive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that means is that if you're down
at this lower range of what other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: do, any incremental increase in your vein
density is going to make a huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in what you can do as a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ways that should not matter for the
overall hydraulics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it just means is that when CO2 is
that high and photosynthetic rates can be
[SPEAKER_00]: that high, if you're not doing it all the
time, you're going to get overgrown just
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a huge disadvantage to having
very low vein densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the expectation would be that the
upper bound, maybe that just can't change
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lower bound in everybody should
increase at times of high carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should lose the lower half of this
pink range here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of Berner's models of,
this is CO2 through time, showing the time
[SPEAKER_00]: periods that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at vein density at these time
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no dependence upon the CO2 what
that lower bound looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medians in all these cases are
basically down in this zone where there
[SPEAKER_00]: should be nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not showing the data, but there's
a variety of CO2 models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you try the different ones,
it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of these bars will change up
and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's always stuff up here and
there's always stuff down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no effect on the vein density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's wrong with that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, it's a good model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got curious about whether we could
figure out, rather than just saying this
[SPEAKER_00]: is wrong and walking away, saying,
well, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we improve upon it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the model that they used,
the way they incorporated vein density
[SPEAKER_00]: into these photosynthetic models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got leaf conductance via the vein
density as per those empirical graphs that
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Broder did in himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they got the leaf
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then flow into the leaf is going to be
dependent upon the leaf conductance and
[SPEAKER_00]: the water potential gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the flow into the leaf has to
balance the evaporation from the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to be related to the vapor
pressure deficits and stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can get stomatal conductance
from the vein density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that can be plugged into a model
of the physical limits of diffusion on CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that can be solved simultaneously
with a different model of photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon the biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you solve those simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you end up with these
curves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a way that we can kind of fix
what they did to actually get something
[SPEAKER_00]: that worked with the fossil record?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first correction we did was getting
back to that thing I showed you about leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they used all leaves being the
same thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: When actually, it should, in some ways,
correlate with the vein density that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very gratifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had some empirical data that
they used to correlate their graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our correction actually matches their
data better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made us happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you look at the resulting
curve, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have a big disadvantage to the
lower end of the vein densities that any
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing the rate gain in
assimilation with vein density here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how much it matters if you
can creep up out of this zone here as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as the overall photosynthetic gain that
would be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that didn't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried a variety of other corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really play with oxygen,
whereas that's going to affect voter
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oxygen also is fluctuated through
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We played with stomatoconductivity,
which should go up and down with carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide concentrations independently of
what's going on with the veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of these corrections matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they only looked at discreetly
low versus high CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at it continuously, where here
the colors are the assimilation rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked continuously at all
potential CO2 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see how the colors stack
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get out of this low CO2 regime,
it matters immensely, getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher of these vein densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of these corrections to what they
did make any difference whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to look a little bit beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one solution that does work is if
we just say maybe ferns can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we lower this VC max, maximum
carboxylation rate, and just assign
[SPEAKER_00]: different rates to different lineages,
it actually solves everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what ended up happening then is
that you still have a plateau related to
[SPEAKER_00]: vein density at different CO2
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is that at high CO2
concentrations, that plateau occurs right
[SPEAKER_00]: at the base of vein densities that plants
do anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, ferns don't care about CO2
concentrations in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher CO2 concentrations, they're not
going to be any more productive,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the argument there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it's really only the angiosperms
that are potentially going up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that goes in the model as maximum
carboxylation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is something where it's
integrating the overall biology of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboxylation and rubisco, that is very
CO2 dependent, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have always kind of assumed
that it should just track CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have to, the whole rest of
the Calvin cycle and the regeneration of
[SPEAKER_00]: RuBP, that is not CO2 dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a variety of other things
that have to do with productivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: like phosphorus and nitrogen, that you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be that much more
productive, you need more phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some indication that that's
actively kind of gets harder as CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at the very least, it's unrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty of reasons to think that
you can't just amp up CO2 and expect
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, is there other reasons to think that
this might be true?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take plants, and these are all just
numbers from the literature, and give them
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated CO2 concentrations, what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, flowering plants end up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferns and conifers that have been done
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no ferns out here potentially
to go up there, as far as their vein
[SPEAKER_00]: densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, within the range that they do
exist, there doesn't appear to be much of
[SPEAKER_00]: an impact of elevating that carbon dioxide
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: People haven't focused upon that,
because they're more interested in these
[SPEAKER_00]: overall patterns and the big things up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no reason to think that these
guys could have responded in that way
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even consistent in a very fun way
with the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is data from a follow-up paper
from these guys, led by Taylor Field,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they measured a whole bunch of
cretaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black circles are non-angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white circles are angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the black circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say what I've been saying,
that there's no response to whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations of CO2 went on in this time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just kind of merely continuing on
with this flat line, as far as their vein
[SPEAKER_00]: densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early flowering plants share that full
range, including the lower half below that
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow line, which corresponds to that
steep part of the gradient there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they evolve, the high vein densities,
and presumably the various physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: capacities that go along with that,
they lose those low vein densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are responding the way you might
expect if this model was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only the flowering plants that do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is potentially a very
useful way to actually bring the fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: record to bear on some of these
relationships that have been proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the graph I've shown explicitly
versus CO2 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These papers, various papers from David
Bierling's work, is relative to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is largely tied to CO2
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think basically you can throw out
the top half of all these graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's even independent
reasons that they couldn't have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten there, which is all of these graphs
are ultimately dependent upon the work of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Berner and his modeling of CO2
concentrations through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Berner is very explicit about what
goes into his model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants are a big part of it,
because the primary drawdown of CO2 from
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere is via silicate weathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's largely mediated by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The acids pumped down into the soil by
roots and so on increases that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biggest feedback on CO2
concentrations are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that if you have more CO2,
there's more productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to the drawdown of more
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CO2 comes back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has these sensitivity analyses
looking at the levels of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right there in his papers of,
if you had as much CO2 fertilization as
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up in these graphs, then you
wouldn't get any change in CO2 at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would just be swamped out by
the plants immediately sucking up that CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: and ending up with the silicate
weathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the silicate weathering of
rocks on land ends up in carbonate rocks
[SPEAKER_00]: in the oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's definitely a CO2
fertilization effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was as extreme as these papers
rely, they wouldn't get the CO2 curve that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using to generate those graphs in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it couldn't have been that productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wouldn't have worked out in that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think productivity really has greatly
increased with the evolution of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the baseline of these papers is
that we're actually living in a world that
[SPEAKER_00]: is very depauperate and very less lush
than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an internal bias on my
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't feel right to think that
the most productive environments were
[SPEAKER_00]: ferns and giraffes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a classic relative to
what we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So climate's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity has changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as a last step,
and this is just a couple slides,
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise, it's been interesting to use
that to think back to the earlier record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, this is really what I like
to think about the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this becomes very important,
because paleoecology has to be founded on
[SPEAKER_00]: modern ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And modern ecology is flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no place on Earth in the
terrestrial environments where flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't represent at least 90% of the
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you go to Siberia, most of the
biomass will be the same couple species of
[SPEAKER_00]: conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the species are going to still
be herbaceous plants underneath that that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So modern ecology is flowering plant
ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything I'm saying says that that
probably is not a good way of thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about this system here back in the
Carboniferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a variety of implications of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to touch on a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the stuff that interests me
the most at this point going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this sometimes gets maligned by
ecologists now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Grimes' Triangle, looking at
ecology based upon different guilds of
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors, your stately oak trees and so
on, versus weeds, things that reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly, use a lot of resources,
and then reproduce and die, versus stress
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slow growing and also have a very
low reproductive output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is related to intensity of stress
and disturbance and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two of these three vertices here are
dependent upon high productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I think that this is
angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a world without angiosperms,
you still have some differentiation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking about a much more
limited triangle, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this to Bill De Michael,
who is a paleoecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, and his immediate response
was, yeah, like I was on my high school
[SPEAKER_00]: football team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know Bill De Michael,
he's about that big and not big in any
[SPEAKER_00]: dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a high school team, there's just
less competition relative to the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still going to be
differentiation within this space,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to be much more limited
than what we see in the modern world,
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon the fact that we're going to be
much more constricted in this range of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's evidence that that is
going to be present, because basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a world without weeds,
in a very real sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that may be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have herbaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have annuals, really,
in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in part, that's also going to be tied
to angiosperm reproductive biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things like bracken is the one thing
that gets often brought up in this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: context as being a competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slow growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a competitor by any kind of
modern sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it's hard for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's there, there's an incumbency
effect, and things can't grow up through
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is definitely not a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really a proper competitor by
these modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one last thing to think about in this
regard, this is an oversampling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Westphalian bee in the Carboniferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is less than a million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is effectively one time slice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows this time slice one,
because we have a lot of fossils from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboniferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, CO2 concentrations were about
what they are now, then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you don't like what I said
about carbon dioxide, photosynthesis would
[SPEAKER_00]: be tied to vein density then the way it is
now, because it's the same relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of lineages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sampled this about as well as we had
in that original paper, sampled modern
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this as well as any other time
slice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all basically one flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some differentiation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all incredibly low relative to
what's seen in literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you would expect to see
in the deep shade, if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: an angiosperm system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're largely even lower than that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think is kind of fun to think
about in terms of just the original
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of vascular flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often kind of couched as kind of
reaching for the light, as far as why we
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve trees on and so on like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anything of these things
cared about light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of them were light
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had other things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these plants were desperately
wanting the light levels that a modern
[SPEAKER_00]: angiosperm tree wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet that's kind of often when we look
at, this is a graph I put together myself
[SPEAKER_00]: many years ago, so I'm as guilty of it as
anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very often when we think about the
Devonian evolution, the Paleozoic
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of vacuolo plants, it's
implicitly there that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological succession and what goes on in
ecological succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these guys are all fighting over light
in a way that I don't think was going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets into questions of why be a
tree at all then?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not trying to shade your
neighbors and get to the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there can be a variety of
kind of non-intuitive but interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things to explore in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could in part be related to being long
lived, because plants keep growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't really avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can even be involved with things like
rooting depth instead, where if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizomatous you're never going to get
roots that are that deep with these
[SPEAKER_00]: adventitious roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there can be a point to being a deep
rooted plant, but that's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: only trees can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be as much about what they're
doing growing down as growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of this that's fairly local is
Bill Stein over at Binghamton has a
[SPEAKER_00]: locality where they have these casts of
tree stumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one kind of basal relative who
would be one of these guys here actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that actually might be a basal
seed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a relative of the seed plants growing
rhizomatously, and it goes from about here
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way across that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been many, many years of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout that growth, if the thing's
going to stay alive, it has to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're rhizomatous growing
horizontally, you're constantly changing
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas there might be a point to sitting
in one spot if you're going to be long
[SPEAKER_00]: lived and growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also allows you then to extract
more nutrients at depth and more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be more complicated than the
easy analogy that's available for modern
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological succession and basing things on
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, one conclusion slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flying plants are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're different in ways
morphologically that translates to their
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that physiology matters for climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And climate is relevant to the fact that
they're also hyperdiverse and biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: in these environments which they dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is all environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also more productive in a way that
I think is not going to be related to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide the way it has been often
related in the older literature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: current literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that they're so different,
it makes it problematic to easily kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: translate from modern ecology to
paleoecology and what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a last point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked about flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked about flowers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often when people talk about
flowering plants, evolution, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on the differences in their
reproductive biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly are extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they matter a lot in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as their overall dominance of
the planet, I think the vegetative biology
[SPEAKER_00]: is as relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure if you're going to have
250,000, 500,000 species, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those have to be rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reproductive biology of
angiosperms is very good at keeping rare
[SPEAKER_00]: species short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also most of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that really comes down to
their vegetative biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reproductive biology allows them to
subdivide all that real estate very
[SPEAKER_00]: finely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason they have all that real
estate in the first place, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: much more down to their vegetative
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at least as important when
thinking about the role of angiosperms in
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern world and how they evolved.
