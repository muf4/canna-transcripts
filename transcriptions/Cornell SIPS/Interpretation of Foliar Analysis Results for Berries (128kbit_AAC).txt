[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the 7th of 12th Berry Soil and
Nutrient Management Webinar, sponsored by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast Sustainable Research and
Education Program, better known as
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast SARE, and hosted by Cornell
University Department of Horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kathy Heidenreich, and I'll be
your moderator for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to let you know that today's
speaker is Dr. Marvin Pritz, who's
[SPEAKER_00]: professor and chair of the Department of
Horticulture at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the topic is Nutrient Management and
Established Plantings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a delay in the program
loading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang on, and it should be up in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to our 6th webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This webinar is on interpreting foliar
analysis, and this gets a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated, and it's not something that
computers can, you know, we can develop
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations for very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you want to do today is walk you
through various ways of interpreting soil
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis and give you a sense of what you
might want to look for when you get these
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a brief review from last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time of leaf sampling varies slightly
between the berry crops, but mostly it's
[SPEAKER_01]: late July and early August when you take
the leaf samples and send them in for
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last couple of weeks, I was able to
find some data to show you what happens to
[SPEAKER_01]: values of nutrient concentrations of
certain elements over the growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is old data and an old slide,
but early on in the season, this is with
[SPEAKER_01]: boron, we found that the levels start off
pretty high, and then they drop during the
[SPEAKER_01]: season, and they stabilize somewhere after
August to a level that's lower and more
[SPEAKER_01]: stable for the rest of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing was true for leaf zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Values start high, they go down,
and they stabilize in the later part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the season when we don't have a lot of
fruit being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is up with strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's why we recommend at
certain times of the year we take the
[SPEAKER_01]: samples when we don't have large changes
in values from week to week.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are standard foliar nutrient ranges
for all the berry crops, and these are
[SPEAKER_01]: generally accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter where you're at, they're pretty
standard across the board, different
[SPEAKER_01]: climates, different soils, and that makes
it nice for interpreting these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you'll notice when you compare
strawberries to raspberries is that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's very little difference between the
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are rosaceous plants, the accepted
values are pretty much the same for both
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it sort of indicates that the
plants are growing in similar ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulating nutrients to a similar
amount, and these are indicative of
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy levels of plants that are growing
normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries are a little bit different
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we compare those with raspberries or
strawberries, the critical values for
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries are usually quite a bit lower
than they are for strawberries and
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things to keep in mind when
you're using a soil and leaf testing lab
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't know much about blueberries
is that they'll often use a standard that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be appropriate for strawberries or
raspberries, and truthfully, many other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops have those similar ranges of
strawberries and raspberries, alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll use those to base the
recommendations on, but really,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to be adjusted downward quite a
bit for blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries just have a much lower
nutrient requirement than many other crops
[SPEAKER_01]: that grow more slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't require as much nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical levels of leaves are much lower
in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep that in mind if you see
giving nutrient recommendations that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem right and maybe that they're using
the wrong standard that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusted for blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one exception in the blueberry
side of things, and that's with manganese,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not going to have much of an
impact on your interpretation,
[SPEAKER_01]: except you might see high manganese values
in blueberries occasionally, and for other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops that might signal a problem,
like, oh, maybe manganese is becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic, but in blueberries, it's not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries have evolved tolerance to high
levels of manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take that manganese and they stick it
in the vacuoles and isolate it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the plant, so when you grind that
leaf and analyze it, you see lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: manganese there, but really, it's not
hurting the plant, and blueberries evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance for that for a couple of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, if you recall a few webinars ago,
we looked at the availability of manganese
[SPEAKER_01]: when the pH changes, and at low pH levels,
manganese levels tend to be higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: so blueberries grow in acid soils,
so we would expect more manganese to be
[SPEAKER_01]: available, but the other thing that
happens is blueberries evolved in soils
[SPEAKER_01]: that tend to flood frequently,
and in flooded soils, you don't have very
[SPEAKER_01]: much oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxygen diffuses very slowly in waterlogged
soils, and when oxygen isn't available,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have these electrons moving around and
if the oxygen is not available to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptor for that electron, that electron
has to go somewhere, so the next thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that it goes to is manganese, and in the
soil, a lot of manganese is available in
[SPEAKER_01]: the form of four pluses, one of the
valence states, but when you throw
[SPEAKER_01]: electrons at it, it converts to the
manganese two form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That manganese two form is the
biologically active form, so all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden, in flooded soils, you get a lot of
this manganese two form, and it's rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up by the plant, and it's
biologically active, and blueberries take
[SPEAKER_01]: that and they put it in a vacuole and
isolate it from the rest of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it doesn't become toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just so you know, if you see that,
it looks odd, it's probably not gonna be a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem unless it gets really,
really high inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the folate, foliar analysis will give
you values of leaf nutrients that just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't show up in the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we sort of discounted levels of
manganese, iron, and zinc, and copper,
[SPEAKER_01]: and soil as not being very meaningful,
but the probability of being deficient
[SPEAKER_01]: varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same for all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some nutrients you're more likely to see
deficient than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, nitrogen, we rarely see it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers fertilize fairly well with
nitrogen, and in fact, we often see it
[SPEAKER_01]: above the critical value that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, growers put on nitrogen oftentimes
more than they really need, and leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis comes back showing it's a little
bit high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rarely see it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way with phosphorus, and our soils,
particularly in the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: where there have been lots of dairy farms
in the past, and people have used manure,
[SPEAKER_01]: to fertilize fields, phosphorus levels are
generally pretty high, and we rarely see
[SPEAKER_01]: it below the critical value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium, we sometimes see low on lighter
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, calcium, sometimes see it low,
but not a real probability of it happening
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot, particularly if the pH is within
the appropriate range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium, that'll sometimes show up as
deficient, particularly in blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese will show up as deficient
somewhat frequently, particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: fields that were once wet and then were
drained.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, there's just not a lot of
manganese in those soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron, it's low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is a very, very common element in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rarely that there's insufficient iron
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, if you see iron deficiency,
it's generally a problem with pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron, though, is an element that is
frequently low in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the Atlantic coastal plain soils
tend to be very low in boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the areas of the world where
boron tends to be deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parts of Ontario and Canada also
deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the one we see most commonly
deficient in leaf analysis is boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zinc, when phosphorus is high,
sometimes zinc is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper, you see it low, sometimes
deficient, particularly in soils that are
[SPEAKER_01]: high in organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question about aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aluminum is really sporadic around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toxicity can be high in low pH soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, if the pH is within a normal
range, we don't see aluminum toxicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if there's a lot of aluminum in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we tend to see aluminum be a problem
is when we lower the pH for blueberries
[SPEAKER_01]: and we release lots of aluminum,
sometimes then we'll see that becoming
[SPEAKER_04]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foliar tests are really useful for
adjusting the fertility program,
[SPEAKER_01]: but only when plants are healthy and the
soil pH is adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The foliar test doesn't really do much
good if there's a disease in the soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants aren't growing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good way to fine tune the
fertility program, but not really use that
[SPEAKER_01]: as a sole guide for whole cell
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we use a foliar analysis,
we want to make sure that the soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally adequate in nutrients,
the plants are growing well, then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really good for making adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just have a soil analysis
alone, it often doesn't give you enough
[SPEAKER_01]: information to develop a recommendation
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do, whenever I look at the foliar
test results, I go through a series of
[SPEAKER_01]: about five or six steps that one after the
other to help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I do is I want to ensure
that the soil pH is within the correct
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not, that'll throw off the foliar
testing value.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just looked at the soil test,
you might say, well, I have to add four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five nutrients to the soil because my
leaves show me deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, a simple adjustment in pH
might correct those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure the soil pH is right
before you jump to conclusions about what
[SPEAKER_01]: is lacking in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is make sure that there's
nothing else that could be limiting the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have diseases in the soil or
something eating roots or something's just
[SPEAKER_01]: not right, the foliar test isn't really
going to be that useful in helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnose the problem or making
corrections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have to be growing relatively
healthily for the foliar test to be
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third thing I do, particularly since
we live along the Atlantic coast and the
[SPEAKER_01]: soils tend to be low on boron is to check
the status of boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a couple of webinars ago about
how boron is essential for root growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: root elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have low boron and your roots
aren't growing, that means the plant can't
[SPEAKER_01]: take up other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boron has to be adequate for the other
nutrients to be taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the third thing I check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if all those things check out,
then I'll look at the specific nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in the leaf analysis and see if they might
be deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I'll do is there's a few
interactions that you might want to check
[SPEAKER_01]: out to make sure things are in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about what some of those are in
a second, but they can exacerbate low
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this gets a little bit complex at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why sometimes just looking over it
yourself is better than having some
[SPEAKER_01]: computer plow through it and try to tease
these apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you some examples in a minute
where we can look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to cover three scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is when the leaf test and the soil
test sort of tell you the same story,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look at a situation or two where
soil tests are low for nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet the leaf analysis is normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, when the soil test is high for
nutrient, yet the leaf test is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about some of those situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got 12 scenarios I want to go
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these are based on real soil and
leaf analysis tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberries, good growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to look down here and we have a
soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things look pretty good in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf analysis is normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of tells you that, hey,
what you've been doing is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks appropriate and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are growing well, so you're
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep up what you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to a second example.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we'll just look at the leaf
analysis here and see what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see normal N, P and K, high calcium,
normal magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we see low manganese, iron,
copper and zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see these four in particular low,
that's a pretty good indication that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not that they're low in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that they're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't be taken up by the plant
because the pH isn't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the pH here, it's a little
bit too high in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to lower that pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: By lowering that pH, it will basically
automatically increase the values of zinc,
[SPEAKER_01]: copper, iron and manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just automatically because the
availability will suddenly go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: These levels of leaf nutrients should go
up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be tricked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think, well, I've got to go out and
find some source of manganese and iron and
[SPEAKER_01]: copper and zinc to add to the blueberry
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost guaranteed it's going to be too
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiger soil, river bottom soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an actual leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at that, normal values of N,
P, K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is normal, but we see low
calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what might be going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to add calcium and magnesium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sort of, but this is a pretty good
indication that the pH is too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we would want to add
probably lime and probably high magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will increase the pH and also
increase the plant's ability to take up
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a pretty good clue, if you just saw
the leaf analysis alone, that when calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: and magnesium are low, that's probably an
indication that the pH is too low as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question came up, is sulfur part of a
normal leaf analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a separate test that's required
for nitrogen and then a separate test that
[SPEAKER_01]: does all the other nutrients except for
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen test is fairly expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have a dose since it's so
critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other nutrient test is fairly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put them together, it's going to cost
about 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do sulfur, it's going to
cost about another 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not worth it because sulfur
and nitrogen track very closely together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time, we don't do sulfur
analysis, particularly because it's rarely
[SPEAKER_01]: ever deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of sulfur around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of sulfates around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur's coming down in the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in most of the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in fertilizers that we apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just something that's just not
worth testing for, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, take another look here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got low nitrogen in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing really low here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron's medium pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: High pH is kind of on the high side for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's normal, but we have some low
iron and copper and zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary cause for the low nitrogen
might not again be we have to go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: add nitrogen, but in this case here,
it's a very weedy field and we have lots
[SPEAKER_01]: of weeds that can suck nitrogen out of the
soil and give us a low leaf value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the grower probably doesn't have to do
anything different in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just manage the weeds better and that
nitrogen level should go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH probably should go down just a
little bit and when the pH goes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll increase the zinc and the copper
and the iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at this whole picture,
two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lower the pH and manage the weeds a little
bit better and that's really a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: simple thing to do and that'll most likely
bring everything back into balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, example five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberries, kinesia soil, poor growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few things are low here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium magnesium medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf analysis, everything looks fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants aren't growing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we conclude from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we conclude that whatever's wrong
with that planting causing poor growth
[SPEAKER_01]: probably isn't nutritional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look for something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a case where the leaf
and soil analysis don't really tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: much about what's going on with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to correct the other factor that
might be limiting growth before the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaf analysis tell us any valuable
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's look at some strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a soil here and we look at the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fairly high amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of like the threshold for
boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what might be going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, the leaf analysis is fine,
but the plants still aren't healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at the field,
we can see that the plants have black root
[SPEAKER_01]: rot or some weevil or something like that
eating the roots of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a situation where the
soil test looks fine, the leaf analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: looks fine, but it doesn't tell us what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens most of the time when plants
are compromised with disease, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the leaf values generally are normal or
high in plants that are diseased because
[SPEAKER_01]: they just aren't growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not difficult for the plant to
accumulate the nutrients it needs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doesn't tell you what's wrong
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you have to look at both the
foliar analysis soil test and the health
[SPEAKER_01]: of the planting because unhealthy plants
almost always have good foliar nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: levels when there's something else that's
causing the poor growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's take another example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we've got medium levels of phosphorus
and potassium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What might be going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's look at the leaf analysis and
see if it gives us a hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an actual test that we got from
soil and leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, boron is a little bit below the
threshold of what we'd like to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaf boron is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that reflected over here
in the foliar test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of at the low end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we don't have boron,
we don't have good root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes that leads to low levels of
some of these other nutrients that require
[SPEAKER_01]: good root growth to be taken up at high
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case here, the recommendation
should probably say raise the pH a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and certainly apply some boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what we need to do in order
to make this correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, example eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have high levels of phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, based on that last example,
you'll say, oh, boron's low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here the pH is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic matter is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look and see how that affected the
leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, look up, it's a well-drained
soil in a dry year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the leaf analysis shows in this case
is that even though we have high potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: and high calcium, the levels in the leaf
are low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high levels in the soil but low levels
in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, probably a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is boron is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have low boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have poor root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't often have the uptake that we
would expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, it was a very dry year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these nutrients, particularly
calcium and potassium to some extent,
[SPEAKER_01]: get taken up by mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get dissolved in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a plant transpires, the water moves
into the plant and brings along the
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved nutrient in that water stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have water.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's dry, that just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we end up with low levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible in many cases to have
high soil test values but low leaf values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually, it's because of low boron or
inadequate water, or sometimes both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen is low in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we don't test for that in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, there might be a need for an
increased level of nitrogen fertilizer in
[SPEAKER_01]: this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What impact would poor drainage have on
foliar values?
[SPEAKER_01]: What that often does is poor drainage
sometimes increases the level of the
[SPEAKER_01]: copper and the zinc and the manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked earlier with the example of
blueberries how you have waterlogged
[SPEAKER_01]: soils, manganese levels go way up,
almost to toxic levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the first things you see
happen in a planting where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: waterlogged soils or poor drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese levels get really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the first signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, sometimes it stops the
plant from growing because the soils are
[SPEAKER_01]: waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaf nutrient levels can come to
normal within normal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at it and you say,
well, I don't really see anything wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaf levels look normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant's not growing because the
soil's waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm saying you have to look at
the big picture and not just look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar analysis because that can be normal
when you have these other impacts going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's look at another example here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberries, kinesia soil, very heavy crop
load, exceptionally heavy crop load of the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil looks fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical value is around one pound per
acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do a leaf analysis, everything's
good except potassium is showing up as
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is potassium low when the soil
values are high?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is reflected over here in the
leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, actual test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you recall, fruiting takes a lot of
potassium from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In years where you have heavy,
heavy fruit load and you test for foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients shortly after fruiting,
you'll often see low levels of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean you have to add potassium
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that you've got to give the
plant time to recover and build back those
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case here, probably the best
thing the grower could do is just ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's adequate moisture in the soil
so that the potassium levels can recover
[SPEAKER_01]: because it looks like there's plenty in
the soil to be taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant just needs time to do that
because it just went through a really
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy cropping load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a reason to understand the big
picture, the cropping history,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on physically to the plant as
well is just look at the soil and foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, 10th example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exhibiting poor growth,
but you look around, you just can't find
[SPEAKER_01]: any disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't find any insect problems,
but the plants are growing poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the soil test, these values
are high, magnesium is medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty of boron in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is right on target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we have poor growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the foliar test and we see some
things are low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is low, even though the soil
levels look adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have low iron, low copper, low zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we have these low values when the
soil tests show that most things are
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is an example of where
sometimes the soil nutrients can be too
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, phosphorus is high,
maybe from using too much manure or too
[SPEAKER_01]: much phosphorus fertilizer in a previous
crop or in a previous year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have high levels of phosphorus in
particular, phosphorus interacts with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these micronutrients and ties them
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It forms precipitates before they even get
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even evidence inside the plant
that phosphorus can interact with these
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients even after they get into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus zinc is one that's commonly
written about in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is known to interfere with iron
uptake and copper uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than likely, in this situation here,
the high phosphorus is actually causing
[SPEAKER_01]: problems and causing low levels of these
other nutrients because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the things you just kind
of have to learn to watch out for because
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliar testing recommendations that
come back from the lab aren't going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to give you this level of detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another negative interaction that you
often see is real high calcium can
[SPEAKER_01]: interfere with iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is especially true in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this example is strawberries,
but we've talked about this before that
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in blueberries, high calcium
is really bad for blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does interfere with iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much iron uptake, but the iron,
when there's high calcium around,
[SPEAKER_01]: the iron is in the ferric form,
which is in the inactive form of iron in
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, as opposed to the ferric plus two
form that's the active form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an interaction that happens with
the valence of the iron, and it affects
[SPEAKER_01]: the activity of the iron in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the phosphorus in the calcium in the
two you have to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they come out at high levels,
it could spell trouble for the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, soil tests are important to make
sure we don't exceed the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and exceed the level of calcium
so we don't induce these deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're getting close to the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries, poor growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here we have both the soil test and
the leaf analysis results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking through here, seeing what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is one of those interaction
kind of things that we see that in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case, blueberries had poor growth,
magnesium is low, the leaves are showing
[SPEAKER_01]: typical magnesium deficiency symptoms,
but we really wouldn't expect to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: from the soil test because the levels in
the soil are medium, but we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that there are
other nutrients that basically compete
[SPEAKER_01]: with magnesium in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those are potassium,
calcium, and zinc to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese will do it too because they all
have this calcium, manganese, and zinc are
[SPEAKER_01]: plus two, so they will compete for binding
sites with the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little bit more subtle,
but again, high values of certain leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients can suppress others,
and in this case here, what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: explains why we're seeing magnesium
deficiency in the leaf when there is
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate magnesium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's subtle and it's not really
picked up with the recommendation,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you kind of have to watch out for that
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the last example I wanted to
review with you, blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very poor growth, but again, you look at
the soil there, there's just no disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil test, everything looks pretty good,
everything's medium or high, boron is
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate, pH is adequate, organic matter
is good, foliar levels are normal or high
[SPEAKER_01]: for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you explain that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I see something like this,
I can't figure out what's going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sometimes go back and ask to look at
this complete soil test and a complete
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar analysis to look at all the
elements that are being reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: The report you get shows the essential
nutrients, but it doesn't show you all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a question came up earlier about
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't show standard aluminum levels
in leaves or even soil in many tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you ask for it, oftentimes the
original analysis has that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not reported on the report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go back and look and see,
oh, maybe aluminum is present at really
[SPEAKER_01]: high levels and it's actually causing a
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing you want to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sodium, not so much in the northeast or
the Midwest, but as you go out further
[SPEAKER_01]: west, you might want to look at sodium
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's not standard on a report,
but too much sodium can raise havoc with
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar nutrient levels and compete with
sodium and cause all sorts of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same way with soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much fertilizer, too much salt can
cause toxic problems in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it doesn't reflect it in the
leaf nutrient values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the examples you
might see, and hopefully that is a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you interpret these foliar analysis
that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't always rely on what the computer
says.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go into the level of detail of
looking at interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most foliar analyses don't tie back in
with soil tests, so you can look at them
[SPEAKER_01]: both simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our goals at Cornell over the long
run is to integrate the soil tests with
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf analysis and include
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one recommendation based on both
the soil and leaf analysis, and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: can account for some of these interactions
that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of anybody who does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have to do that with your own
human brain and perform those analyses and
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust the recommendations that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question, so soil compaction has the
same impact on foliar values as pore
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compaction doesn't alter the amount of
oxygen in the soil as much as you might
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it reduces it some, but when you
wet it, it really pushes the oxygen out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have that same response with
accumulating high levels of manganese and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff with compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get poor root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: With compacted soils, it's hard to predict
what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: One outcome is it's just poor growth,
but the plants have adequate nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: given their small size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another is you'll see deficiencies in
certain nutrients and not others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to predict specifically
what the impact of compaction will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any consistent effect on
foliar nutrients alone by looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last principle that I want to share
with you is something called the Steinberg
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens at low levels of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about a situation where you have a
plant that has adequate nutrients of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything except for one nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just pick one at random.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very low levels of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's limiting growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants aren't growing well, magnesium is
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start to add magnesium to the soil and
the plant starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see growth increases as we add more
and more nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plant starts to grow,
we often get what's called a dilution
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant grows so fast because now all of
a sudden it has magnesium that foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: levels actually drop even though we're
adding more nutrient to the soil or to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The foliar concentrations drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because we're stimulating growth so
much and the plants are growing faster
[SPEAKER_01]: than the rate of uptake because that
nutrient was limiting before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's not so limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are really growing fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of reverses and the levels
actually drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll get to the point where they
start to behave normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go through the critical concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You reach a point where not much happens
as you add more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get out of real high end,
you get to be at the toxic range where
[SPEAKER_01]: growth actually starts to drop off again,
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this place right in here is an
interesting place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sometimes see this when values are
really, really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grower will add what we tell them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come back the next year and test
again and say, hey, my foliar values
[SPEAKER_01]: actually fell after I did what you told me
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, trust you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's going on is you say,
well, how happened to growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the plants grew really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants grew well, diluted out the
levels of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, until we're at a point where the
plants are looking good and growing well
[SPEAKER_01]: and the yields are good, that's why these
foliar tests are better for these
[SPEAKER_01]: fine-tuned adjustments in these whole cell
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's summarize what we've talked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sol tests results don't always correlate
with foliar test results and we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about a variety of reasons why that might
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folar tests aren't really meaningful for
fertility guidelines unless the soil pH is
[SPEAKER_01]: within the correct range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think by now you should understand
why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folar tests are useful for diagnosis,
but not for detailed guidance unless
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and yield are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when growth and yield are good,
the foliar tests are really good for
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sometimes good for diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's major things wrong besides
nutrition, the foliar tests aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be that helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we just mentioned with the
Steinberg effect, applying nutrients may
[SPEAKER_01]: result in a decrease in foliar
concentrations under certain
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be thrown off if applying a
nutrient gives you a lower foliar value
[SPEAKER_01]: the following year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a good thing because the
plants are growing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And correcting deficiencies or imbalances
in these established plantings based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliar test is going to be more
difficult than amending soils prior to
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be the subject of the
next webinar that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to be a lot trickier
when the plants are in the ground and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have roots and you can't mix things in
with the soil after the plants are already
[SPEAKER_01]: established.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to start reverting to foliar
sprays and certain nutrients that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I have for today's subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was a lot and it's somewhat
detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always go back and review the
webinar and go through those examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to stop and not overwhelm you
with a lot of ways to correct that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll save that for the next webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, we'll see if anybody has
any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to type into the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Bob Chittin mentioned that Eric
Hanson received the Distinguished Service
[SPEAKER_01]: Award by the Michigan State Horse Society
at last week's Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really great, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eric will be next webinar's speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're glad to have him involved in this
series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So questions, go ahead and type those
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're waiting for any questions,
I just wanted to say some of you have not
[SPEAKER_00]: yet sent me the demographics questionnaire
and the educator pretest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please download those and send them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Mark made a comment that it's
frustrating sometimes when people send you
[SPEAKER_01]: the tissue test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you know something's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't know what the soil pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what the condition of
plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to call them up and ask a
bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope that they remember and give you the
right answer and try to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope in the future that's why we
want to set up a system where growers
[SPEAKER_01]: submit soil samples simultaneously with
leaf analysis and fill out the form so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get all that information in one place
so we don't have to try to piece it
[SPEAKER_01]: together later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, so good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we ever see tying up of nitrogen from
straw mulch in lower foliar analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you have the straw mulch down
first or even bark mulch like on
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries and you throw fertilizer on
top of it, sometimes you have to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of nitrogen you apply because
that'll get tied up when it's way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria that are breaking down the
straw mulch will grab some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen and hold onto it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually it will get down into the roots
but it's a little bit more slow because
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's in an organic form as opposed to
the nitrate or ammonium form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll eventually get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's underneath the straw,
generally it won't tie it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll work its way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly on its way through when it's
in close combination with that organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter that's being broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, does there tend to be
more nutrient issues in blueberries versus
[SPEAKER_01]: other small food crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the answer is yes to that but it's
mostly because people are trying to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries on soils that they really
shouldn't be growing blueberries on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they dump a lot of sulfur on there to
try to lower the pH and that's what they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do but that releases all sorts of
other nutrients that normally aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: present at high levels and it causes these
interactions to happen that you don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: with strawberries and raspberries under
our pH range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more normal for crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we do see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see so many nutrient problems on
some of the lighter soils where
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries might grow naturally like in
western Michigan or New Jersey along the
[SPEAKER_01]: shore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in upland soils, yeah, we see a lot
more problems with nutrients than we would
[SPEAKER_01]: with strawberries or raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mark says, with blueberries it's pH,
pH, pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that's exactly, I would agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time with blueberries,
when you correct the pH, that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes solve a lot of those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those nutrient problems that you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, on these, some of these soils
that people are trying to grow blueberries
[SPEAKER_01]: on, they just should not be growing
blueberries but they want to do it so they
[SPEAKER_01]: throw the sulfur on there to get that pH
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just starts a cascade of other
problems that are unintended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there are any other
questions and so we want to wish you happy
[SPEAKER_00]: holidays and we'll see you on the first
week of January for the next webinar in
[SPEAKER_00]: the series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
