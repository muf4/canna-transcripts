[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome again to the NASGA
Winter Webinar Series.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to have you with us today for
the third and final in this first
[SPEAKER_00]: mini-series on day-neutral strawberry
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be discussing diseases with
Dr. Frank Lowes from North Carolina State
[SPEAKER_00]: University and insect and light management
with Dr. David Hanley from the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to tell you that the first two
webinar recordings are posted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see in the web links box there's a
berry archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on that it will take you to
the Cornell fruit website where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our berry webinars recorded and
you'll be able to listen to those
[SPEAKER_00]: recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've not participated in a webinar
before I'm just going to remind you that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can type your comments or questions
into the chat box at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and push the little bubble or the
enter button to submit those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up above on the menu bar you'll see
there's a little person with the hand
[SPEAKER_00]: raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ways for you to provide feedback
or comments while the speakers are
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can agree or disagree with a
statement, ask them to speak louder or
[SPEAKER_00]: softer, to speed up, to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they tell a joke you can laugh,
you can applaud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are options for you to
participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without further ado we're going to begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first speaker today is Dr. Frank
Lowes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank is professor of plant pathology and
director of the Center for Integrated Pest
[SPEAKER_00]: Management at North Carolina State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew up with a farming background
including strawberry production and has
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with strawberry diseases the past
15 years at NCSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Lowes seeks to develop IPM programs
that help growers do their best in
[SPEAKER_00]: producing high quality fruit with maximum
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant pathology research program has
included work on strawberry farming
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, soil borne disease management,
methyl bromide alternatives, and seeking
[SPEAKER_00]: new knowledge about the biology and
management of foliar fruit and crown rot
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you very much Kathy and
am I coming through okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay well thank you very much for the
invitation and it's good to have all these
[SPEAKER_07]: attendees.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of friends in different places
in Canada and the US and many people I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know but it's great to have you
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk about integrated disease
management of strawberries and a lot of my
[SPEAKER_07]: data and information is biased towards
plastic culture systems but the
[SPEAKER_07]: information is transferable to a lot of
systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you know the biology and what we
know will apply to matted rose systems as
[SPEAKER_07]: well as to the day neutral strawberry
systems and before I get into the data and
[SPEAKER_07]: the information I just wanted to highlight
some key players.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Dr. Mahfuzur Rahman here and then
shown here and he's a postdoc that's done
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of this work and he just got a
faculty position at West Virginia so we're
[SPEAKER_07]: very pleased for the opportunity he has.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Carnes is a student here at NCSU and
he's worked a lot with Dr. Rahman to
[SPEAKER_07]: generate a lot of data we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jim Driver also is a technician in my
program and he's provided a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: support and field work that we do and
finally Rob Welker has done a lot of work
[SPEAKER_07]: in managing our methyl bromide
alternatives program and I'm only going to
[SPEAKER_07]: show two or three slides about that
towards the end of the talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also get a lot of great support from
grower associations, USDA, the Southern
[SPEAKER_07]: Region Center and we do a lot of on-farm
work so we're highly appreciative of what
[SPEAKER_07]: growers do and how we interact with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of diseases that hit
strawberry and you know here I highlight
[SPEAKER_07]: minor diseases in terms of what we see in
our production systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not true across the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably run into more phytophthora
crown rot but say maybe in Ontario they
[SPEAKER_07]: might run into more red steel issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to highlight a few of the
diseases and problems, the most prevalent
[SPEAKER_07]: ones that occur in our production systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing that I want to highlight
and one of the most important things as a
[SPEAKER_07]: diagnostician you know I'll go in a field
and I'll often ask the question try to
[SPEAKER_07]: discern if the problem is a living factor
or is it a non-living factor.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, might have excess bone boron,
high fertilizer which can cause leaf
[SPEAKER_07]: necrosis and plant death and it could look
like certain crown rot diseases.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just discerning what the issue is and
of course a lot of times it's not that
[SPEAKER_07]: easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So most states, provinces, etc.
[SPEAKER_07]: have very good diagnostic facilities and
it's going to be very important to figure
[SPEAKER_07]: out what the issue is to implement proper
control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So getting the proper identification is a
key part of an IPM program.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of diseases that hit
strawberries and I'm not going to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, phytophthora where you have
leather rot that occurs in certain
[SPEAKER_07]: production systems, in matter rose
systems, soil-based systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see it much here in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_07]: Powdery mildew is a big issue and I know a
presentation was made not too long ago on
[SPEAKER_07]: powdery mildew and I know in more northern
production areas there's more leaf scorch,
[SPEAKER_07]: leaf spot issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see them as much in our annual
systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we might have questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have questions, we're happy to
answer questions about issues you might
[SPEAKER_07]: have run into.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start with botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: With botrytis, the most important thing is
just the biology of the organism.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm showing here are three key things
related to biology of the organism.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is generally true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm showing here, circling it in red,
a petiole and you can see a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: sporulation of botrytis on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now in our production systems,
the botrytis can live on green tissue and
[SPEAKER_07]: then when that green tissue dies,
it sporulates on that dead and dying
[SPEAKER_07]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then the pathogen, I'm showing with
this green arrow here, the pathogen gets
[SPEAKER_07]: in through the flower, through the stamens
and it appears that about 90% of the fruit
[SPEAKER_07]: infection actually occurs through the
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then over here in the top right,
which is what I highlight as C,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can see the botrytis gray mold rot
occurring and it's starting at the calyx
[SPEAKER_07]: end.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that infection occurred through the
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that happens, it's felt about 90% of
the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in the lower left, where we have B,
you can see botrytis and it's colonizing
[SPEAKER_07]: the lower part of the berry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that colonization could have
happened because a flower petal fell on
[SPEAKER_07]: the berry and or you see it sitting on
decaying residue and then the botrytis
[SPEAKER_07]: gets in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the key thing here is that the
understanding the biology helps us
[SPEAKER_07]: understand management.
[SPEAKER_07]: So botrytis primarily gets in through the
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we focus on how to manage that
enicholam before it gets into the flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in our annual systems, we've done a
lot of work where we plant in October and
[SPEAKER_07]: then we manage that crop over the winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we find that the crop,
the leaves that over winter will die in
[SPEAKER_07]: the spring and this becomes a very
important source of enicholam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we feel we need to really
concentrate in this time period for
[SPEAKER_07]: managing botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll talk about, you know,
how we do that both from cultural
[SPEAKER_07]: management or a fungicide management
approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we will see botrytis hit the
crown.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see on this plant, you can see the
lower crown is colonized by botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: This often happens if there's some bloom
that occurs, that bloom gets frost killed,
[SPEAKER_07]: then the botrytis will grow down,
the bloom stems and then start colonizing
[SPEAKER_07]: the crown.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have thick plants, cool wet
conditions, you'll see that crown rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: In those cases, a lot of times it doesn't
lock out the plant, it can set the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you do use fungicides, a product
like Switch or Roveraw, which has systemic
[SPEAKER_07]: activities, does a very nice job to limit
the damage from crown rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we think about managing botrytis,
one of the most important things is to
[SPEAKER_07]: manage fertility.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you have excess fertility,
you may or may not get more yield,
[SPEAKER_07]: you get softer fruit, you have more
botrytis damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Optimum plant spacing, that's different,
of course, in a plasticulture system
[SPEAKER_07]: versus matted row.
[SPEAKER_07]: But excess density of plants will have
more high humidity conditions where that
[SPEAKER_07]: flower is and where the berry is,
and then we'll get more plant or more
[SPEAKER_07]: fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put here, remove dead and dying leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're an organic grower,
in perennial systems as well as in annual
[SPEAKER_07]: systems, if you can remove that dead and
dying leaves before bloom, you can
[SPEAKER_07]: decrease your inoculum load a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, botrytis, of course, produces lots of
spores, and then once it starts,
[SPEAKER_07]: it produces a lot more.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've seen data where that procedure
can decrease botrytis incidence by up to
[SPEAKER_07]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you use fungicides, some of the
chemistry we have now is so good on
[SPEAKER_07]: botrytis that it probably doesn't pay to
spend $300 or $400 an acre removing dead
[SPEAKER_07]: and dying leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably doesn't pay to reduce
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we talked about initiating
fungicide sprays at first bloom,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then if you use fungicides to make
sure you rotate the chemistry to avoid any
[SPEAKER_07]: problems with developing resistance in the
population.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll come back to specific
recommendations and products.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second disease I wanted to talk about
is anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see here, an annual system,
and I know this happens a lot in Ontario,
[SPEAKER_07]: Ohio, other production regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like a beautiful field.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a great fruit load,
and there was no indication of disease
[SPEAKER_07]: until that fruit started coming on,
and then we had wet, very hot conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a severe epidemic of anthracnose in
that field.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the organisms that we're concerned
about, one, is Colatotrichum acutatum.
[SPEAKER_07]: It causes a fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of the typhoid Mary for us as
strawberry growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second one, Colatotrichum glias
spheroides.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of growers here call it the glow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Colatotrichum fergari, they cause a
crown rot, and we consider these to be of
[SPEAKER_07]: low to moderate importance in terms of the
incidence as well as the amount of damage
[SPEAKER_07]: that they might occur for us as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll talk about both the crown rot and
the fruit rot that we run into.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason that the acutatums are so
important, I'm not sure what this green
[SPEAKER_07]: line is here, there's some kind of quirk
in the system, but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: anthracnose does come in on the
transplants.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is especially true for Colatotrichum
acutatum.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be very important for glias
spheroides, although glias spheroides has
[SPEAKER_07]: a very wide host range, and Dr. Raman here
and folks in Florida have shown that wild
[SPEAKER_07]: host species can be a very important
source of the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: But plant source is very important,
and once the organism is introduced to the
[SPEAKER_07]: field, it lives on the leaves and green
leaves, and then it can sporulate either
[SPEAKER_07]: on the green leaves or dead tissue,
then it goes to the berry and causes
[SPEAKER_07]: lesions on the berry, and then we get this
secondary buildup of the disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here in our systems, we can run from 0
to 80 percent fruit rot in a 14-day time
[SPEAKER_07]: span when the weather is favorable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very devastating.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a slide Dr. Raman put together
just showing over here on the right what
[SPEAKER_07]: anthracnose fruit rot will look like,
and on the lower left we see a plant
[SPEAKER_07]: that's wilting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we look over at the crown here,
we can see marbling internal in the crown.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to think that was fairly
diagnostic, but sometimes it's hard to
[SPEAKER_07]: tell from phytophthora because the two can
have similar symptoms.
[SPEAKER_07]: The anthracnose also can affect the,
especially the acutatum strain,
[SPEAKER_07]: the young tissue, and if you grow plug
plants, you can have severe epidemics in
[SPEAKER_07]: plug production systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the young tissue here being
damaged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over here you can see a petiole with
damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can cause a flower blast or early fruit
damage, and also can cause a black dry rot
[SPEAKER_07]: on green fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So acutatum can cause multiple symptoms on
a plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gleosporoides, likewise, we can see in
addition to the crown rot, sometimes we'll
[SPEAKER_07]: see these lesions on the leaves,
and Gleosporoides is in that tissue,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we can PCR it out of that tissue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had some severe epidemics.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the lower left here, you can see
there's a 60,000 plants, plug plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the severe damage that's being
caused by acutatum, and we see a range of
[SPEAKER_07]: symptoms where the plug plant did not grow
out, or it grew out and is not thrifty,
[SPEAKER_07]: and sometimes we can even see kind of a
black root rot associated with that
[SPEAKER_07]: colotachrum acutatum strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mostly a foliar, upper, and a fruit
problem, but it can affect the roots also.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we do a lot of work with the
colotachrums, we use what we know about
[SPEAKER_07]: its biology to assay the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here on the left, you can see a leaf,
and you can see large collections of
[SPEAKER_07]: spores on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we do is we dip that leaf in
gramoxone.
[SPEAKER_07]: That immediately kills the leaf,
and then within four, five, seven days,
[SPEAKER_07]: the fungus will grow out of that tissue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is a close-up, and you can see just
billions of spores in that small area,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then if a rain splash hits that,
those spores will get dispersed and splash
[SPEAKER_07]: to the next berry and cause a severe
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use this paraquat method to assay it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, and NASCA has supported this,
we've also developed and implemented
[SPEAKER_07]: real-time PCR assays and other
high-throughput diagnostic methods to
[SPEAKER_07]: advance our ability to detect the passive
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me review.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Thracnose, we saw that in many cases,
infested plants are the main source of the
[SPEAKER_07]: disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our experience, the pathogen does not
survive well from one crop to another.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a nice break in between,
like a summer break or a winter break,
[SPEAKER_07]: here we have a summer break from June to
October.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, in mat-and-row systems,
you might have rotation systems or a
[SPEAKER_07]: winter break.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we saw that infested tips can lead to
widespread problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pathogen comes in as quiescent
infections, and then it can spread to the
[SPEAKER_07]: fruit, and gliosporidase can be an
alternative host and cause problems from
[SPEAKER_07]: those alternative hosts.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we think about management, the most
important IPM tool is to get disease-free
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that tongue-in-cheek because in many
cases, it could be in the nursery but not
[SPEAKER_07]: showing any symptoms, and then we take it
to the fruiting field or the plugged
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse, and then it expresses itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can only follow the best protocols
possible through certification or
[SPEAKER_07]: third-party inspections.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have great relationships with our
nursery providers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have very good nursery growers that
seek and prevent these kind of issues from
[SPEAKER_07]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do see anthracnose on a few plants,
let's say both of them, if you see crown
[SPEAKER_07]: rot or if you see the accutidium strain,
the fruit rot, if it's a small hot spot,
[SPEAKER_07]: we've had success in roguing out those
plants, and then you need to bury or burn
[SPEAKER_07]: those plants to make sure the inoculum is
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do use fungicides, then the
Strobilurin fungicides have been excellent
[SPEAKER_07]: products for doing that, and then I'll
provide some specific recommendations of
[SPEAKER_07]: how they might be used.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our work, I'll just give you a little
bit of background of how we approach
[SPEAKER_07]: solving these problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, I think grower knowledge and the
scientific knowledge that we have about
[SPEAKER_07]: the biology is critical to managing
things, and I hope I gave an idea that we
[SPEAKER_07]: always want to use as many tools as we can
to manage the problem, and that's pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: consistent from production system to
production system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then in our protocols, when we get a new
product, we screen for the efficacy of the
[SPEAKER_07]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to see what spectrum of pathogens
it controls, and then we try to integrate
[SPEAKER_07]: that into management systems for our
growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of products that have come
on the market in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the old ones are still available.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have protectants, we have systemics,
and this is a list of a number of the
[SPEAKER_07]: products that are available, at least in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the names are different in Canada,
I know, but we have a good arsenal in the
[SPEAKER_07]: last number of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be an example of a field trial
that we would do, and Jim Driver is shown
[SPEAKER_07]: here with a weed whacker, but he often
puts out the fungicide troughs for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some early data we got when we
first were getting a hold of products like
[SPEAKER_07]: Quadris, Switch, and Elevate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just show here how botrytis fruit mold
increased, especially we get it in the
[SPEAKER_07]: early season when it's cool and wet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you can see how Switch and Elevate
are very superior botrytis products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the strobilurins, if you just have
straight strobies, they provide modest
[SPEAKER_07]: control of botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is data that Mifusa recently
developed in 2009.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of our growers here, I just wanted to
highlight, if we have nine fungicide
[SPEAKER_07]: sprays, we can get very good control of
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we move here to the right, we can see
that we can have anywhere from 4% to 6%
[SPEAKER_07]: botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is over the whole season.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see 15%, 18%, 25% in the early
season, but if you average out the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: season, it works out to be about 5% year
in and year out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see if we use a nine-week spray
program, we can reduce that to below 2%.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's very important, this relates to the
biology, is that if we used four
[SPEAKER_07]: well-toned time sprays during bloom,
and you've got to remember here in North
[SPEAKER_07]: Carolina, we'll have an extended bloom
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd need to confer with your local
extension, but in matted row systems,
[SPEAKER_07]: two well-time fungicides where you have a
very succinct bloom period, it appears
[SPEAKER_07]: like two sprays might be enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use CAPTAN, and then the P stands for
pristine, and then Switch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do CAPTAN, pristine, Switch,
pristine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see those four well-time sprays
give us as good control as nine sprays
[SPEAKER_07]: through the whole season.
[SPEAKER_07]: That relates to the biology of organism.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now for the day-neutral strawberry
production system, maybe that can be a
[SPEAKER_07]: point of discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly day neutrals might be dealing with
more summer weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the cool wet season.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not be as big of an issue,
so we can talk about that if necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do a lot of work in post-harvest
season.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do a lot of work in post-harvest fruit
rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see our tray here, and you can see
some rows, which represents a given
[SPEAKER_07]: treatment where we have almost no mold,
and way on the bottom here, you can see
[SPEAKER_07]: almost 100% gray mold in the control.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some excellent data.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just on the top left here, you can see if
the control is not sprayed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can have 85% fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: These fruit are harvested with no
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_07]: We surface sterilize them to get rid of
rhizopus, then we incubate them,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we get 85% of the fruit growing
with botrytis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see if we use Switch, or pristine,
or some of these other programs,
[SPEAKER_07]: the amount of post-harvest fruit rot is
substantially reduced.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new product coming on the
market, Luna Sensation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It also gives good post-harvest fruit rot
control.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a slide of anthracnals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we can go from zero to 80%.
[SPEAKER_07]: 80% fruit rot in four days.
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, the plot is showing number
of fruit, but you can see how serious it
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we look at the strobilurins,
we get excellent control, as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: Captivate.
[SPEAKER_07]: That combination seems to give good
suppression of botrytis, and it's mostly
[SPEAKER_07]: the Captin ingredient that does the work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall, the strobilurins are better than
Captin, but Captin is an important partner
[SPEAKER_07]: in an anthracnals management program.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thyram.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Florida, they use a lot of thyram,
but that's because they spray so much,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they have limitations on how many
times they can use Captan.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not seen thyram perform as well
for anthracnose management.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to highlight this slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bit dark, but what this shows is we
have the non-treated control where we had
[SPEAKER_07]: 68% anthracnose, and then you can see
where we have a program where I hit the
wrong button.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see where we have a program where
we have a 26% anthracnose incident,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's with Captan pristine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we also did a Captan abound program,
or Quadris, and we're seeing compromise in
[SPEAKER_07]: our program here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the last two, three years,
we've seen abound and pristine fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, some of you growers might say,
wow, 26% anthracnose is still a lot,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you have to remember that what we do
is we leave control plots.
[SPEAKER_07]: We leave unsprayed portions, and there's a
lot of spores produced in those,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they will splash disperse to our
fungicide trial where we have treatments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most growers that I know don't leave
unsprayed controlled plots if they have
[SPEAKER_07]: anthracnose in their field.
[SPEAKER_07]: This just shows you the data.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pristine gave excellent results.
[SPEAKER_07]: Abound started to compromise the control
in Quadris compromised it even more,
[SPEAKER_07]: even though it's the same active
ingredient, and then you can see the
[SPEAKER_07]: control.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had up to 70% fruit rot in that
particular harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are shying away from Quadris abound
recommendations for anthracnose
[SPEAKER_07]: management.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, those strains, this is with the
accutidum strains, and we don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: handle on this, why that is, so we're
trying to understand that better.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I did want to highlight, too,
again, if we use an eight weeks program,
[SPEAKER_07]: we get excellent control of anthracnose
fruit rot, and then Natalia Perez,
[SPEAKER_07]: and recently there's a number of players
who have joined her group, Mike Ellis in
[SPEAKER_07]: Ohio, Mark Gleason in Iowa, us in North
Carolina, Guido Schnabel in South
[SPEAKER_07]: Carolina, and others using forecasting
methods, and with that model, Dr. Raman
[SPEAKER_07]: could show that three well-timed sprays
based on weather patterns offered equal
[SPEAKER_07]: control of anthracnose as compared to
weekly sprays.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is going to be really
important for people who have stretched
[SPEAKER_07]: out seasons so that you don't have to
spend too much money on fungicides,
[SPEAKER_07]: but really link it to weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with some of the new local weather
tools that are becoming available,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can foresee this becoming an important
part of our future programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to highlight where a lot of
our IPM recommendations are.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to smallfruits.org, you can find
excellent production guides and
[SPEAKER_07]: recommendations for many of the small
fruits.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's geared towards the southeast,
but I think you will find a lot of that
[SPEAKER_07]: information highly valuable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to highlight some of the stuff we
put in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put efficacy tables in, so if you're
going to use a certain fungicide,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can go across here and see how it
performs for different pathogens you might
[SPEAKER_07]: encounter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just zoomed in on some of that data.
[SPEAKER_07]: For Abound, we've degraded its rating for
anthracnose, but something like Pristine
[SPEAKER_07]: gives excellent botrytis control because
it's got a Boscolyd component,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's got a good botryticide, and an
anthracnose product in there, so it gives
[SPEAKER_07]: good control of both.
[SPEAKER_07]: Captain is modest on both.
[SPEAKER_07]: Captivate, we saw Elevate, Elevate just
gives excellent control of botrytis,
[SPEAKER_07]: and with that Captain component in the
Captivate, we also get some anthracnose
[SPEAKER_07]: activity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And likewise, Switch is a great
botryticide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let me go back there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, knowing this efficacy data,
I think you just got to select the
[SPEAKER_07]: products to manage the problems that you
know are in your field.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you don't have anthracnose,
and you're mostly concerned about
[SPEAKER_07]: botrytis, Switch and Elevate rotated with
Captan give you an excellent botrytis
[SPEAKER_07]: program, and also good disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you have anthracnose, or are
concerned about it, then you probably need
[SPEAKER_07]: to incorporate Pristine in your program,
and it also gives good botrytis activity.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just in terms of principles in
fungicide management, that's how I would
[SPEAKER_07]: approach it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to hit two other diseases real
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I toss a crown rot, we can see how the
pathogen grew into the middle of the
[SPEAKER_07]: crown, caused severe problems,
that plant will collapse.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we find is that if I take roots,
and I use a razor blade, and just scrape
[SPEAKER_07]: those black roots, we can find O spores in
the roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those survive in the soil for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pathogens, a water mold, and over here
in the bottom right, part of its cycle is
[SPEAKER_07]: zoospores, which can swim.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, that really affects some
management recommendations.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for phytophthora management,
you need excellent good soil drainage,
[SPEAKER_07]: and just decrease any potential for
standing water where the phytophthora
[SPEAKER_07]: might get started.
[SPEAKER_07]: That, of course, is true for red steel
also, for our more northern production
[SPEAKER_07]: regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our IPM guide, where people use
fumigation, we have a table that just
[SPEAKER_07]: helps for product selection, especially if
you combine it with some of the new
[SPEAKER_07]: plastics, like virtually impermeable film,
we see excellent efficacy of a range of
[SPEAKER_07]: pests.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will knock out phytophthora in the
fumigated zone, but phytophthora can come
[SPEAKER_07]: back into the bed with a ventricle,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a good source of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the products that are available,
Ritamil Gold, one pint per treated acre.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, that would be the actual amount
applied in the rows.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in our plastic culture system,
if you have two acres of physical land,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's only one acre under plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you'd apply a pint to that two acres
of physical land.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the phosphites also give good
control, not as good as Ritamil,
[SPEAKER_07]: but their strength is that that product
can be absorbed through the foliage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if the roots are damaged, then the
phosphate can be fully applied,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you also can get some response to
that if you have phytophthora problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ritamil Gold, it's really good to get it
in the root system, because it's only
[SPEAKER_07]: picked up by the roots and then moved to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we really like to link those
applications to crop phenology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in our plastic culture systems,
we know we get rapid root growth in the
[SPEAKER_07]: fall, soon after planting, and then right
around this time of year, we get rapid
[SPEAKER_07]: root growth shown in the green.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's when we want to have our
applications to control phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I just want to talk briefly about
anguar leafspot xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very host specific.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can only survive in association with
living plant tissue or strawberry residue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once that residue breaks down,
the pathogen dies out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see symptoms in the field possibly
start sunting, and if you look at the
[SPEAKER_07]: leaf, especially on the underside,
you would get a lot of bacteria oozing
[SPEAKER_07]: out, or if it's not that advanced,
if you hold that leaf to the light,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can look through those lesions.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're translucent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can cause a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the biggest problems we have,
we might not get many foliar symptoms,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the pathogen colonizes the calyx.
[SPEAKER_07]: The calyx gets these ugly looking
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see them here at the lower right,
the lesions, and then that distracts from
[SPEAKER_07]: the aesthetic value of the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a lot of useful tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: Healthy plants is the most important tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting it from nurseries that don't have
a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Limiting overhead watering and frost
protection.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be aggravated by frost
protection.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do recommend copper sprays to prevent
it from getting on the calyx, but we've
[SPEAKER_07]: done experience putting on 11 copper
sprays through the winter and season
[SPEAKER_07]: without really impacting the amount of
disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's work by a group in Florida looking
at heat treating of tips or plants before
[SPEAKER_07]: they go into a nursery to prevent the
problem from spreading.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more work to be done there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, I just wanted to highlight,
in terms of diseases, it takes an IPM
[SPEAKER_07]: approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a fair amount of work with
host resistance.
[SPEAKER_07]: We looked at reduced spray programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know looking at the biology,
fertility programs can have an impact on
[SPEAKER_07]: disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: Detection and weather forecasting systems,
integrating all these things are very
[SPEAKER_07]: important at the grower level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the interchange between the science
and practice of growing strawberries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, I just wanted to highlight two
slides about fumigation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done a lot of work with looking at
fumigation.
[SPEAKER_07]: As many of you know, methyl bromide is
pretty well phased out for strawberry use.
[SPEAKER_07]: This slide shows if we treat with methyl
bromide, we can use straight
[SPEAKER_07]: chloropichrine, drip, apply 1,3-D
chloropichrine.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of like a C35 formulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we can shank apply it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can use metam sodium, either shank and
rotatil then, or drip applied.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can make all these products work
with similar efficacy as methyl bromide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So technically, sometimes they're more
challenging to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of soil conditions, in our
systems, if we don't fumigate,
[SPEAKER_07]: we get about 60 to 80% crop yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our main problem is black root rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true for most areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have plant killers like
verticillium, then fumigation can also be
[SPEAKER_07]: very critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you can have total plant death.
[SPEAKER_07]: But mostly, we get plant stunting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have these alternative fumigants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we've done a lot of work at looking
at biologically based systems and cover
[SPEAKER_07]: crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the summer, we can grow a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we add compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: We work that in together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We pull the beds in September.
[SPEAKER_07]: We manage that crop over the winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can get excellent yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've seen some of our growers
transition to organics using crop
[SPEAKER_07]: rotations, cover crops, and biologically
based systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the things that I wanted to
highlight, just to emphasize the
[SPEAKER_07]: importance of identifying the biology.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're an organic grower, then
management becomes key, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_07]: external inputs.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not an organic grower,
we have some excellent fungicide products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're used judiciously,
related to the biology, potential of
[SPEAKER_07]: forecasting, and in proper rotation,
I think they will continue to be excellent
[SPEAKER_07]: tools for us in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Kathy, that brings me to the end of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll turn it back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have time for one or two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom is asking if you can comment about
organic materials.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of botrytis and anthracnose
products, we've done a fair amount of work
[SPEAKER_07]: with biologicals, organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's say if we get 80%, 90% control
with some of the fungicide products,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, man, we might get 10%, 20%,
30% control.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can rely on organic
products as a main strategy tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: To manage these foliar and fruit diseases,
you need a whole integrated management
[SPEAKER_07]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, are there other questions for Frank?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a comment from Raymond from
Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluazenam or chlorothalonil active
substance can be effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certain places have the products
registered for those uses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't have chlorothalonil
registered.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that depends on your location of your
production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we'll have a chance to ask Frank some
more questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Frank.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next speaker is Dr. David Handley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the Extension Vegetable and Small
Fruit Specialist and a Cooperating
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor of Horticulture for the
University of Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Handley has been based at the Highmore
Farm Agricultural Experiment Station since
[SPEAKER_00]: 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he carries out applied research
regarding berry and vegetable variety
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation, production techniques,
and pest management strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He coordinates statewide integrated pest
management programs for strawberries and
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: David is the author of numerous extension
fact sheets, articles and newsletters,
[SPEAKER_00]: and co-editor of two regional small fruit
production guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: David.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I hope everyone can hear me if I've
got this thing set up right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger, while we're waiting, did you have a
question?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could type your question into the
chat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger, we'll get your question at the end,
OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, David.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Frank, what I want to do is
concentrate on a couple of pests that have
[SPEAKER_06]: shown to be most problematic in the
day-neutral production systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk a little bit about some of the
minor pests on day-neutrals, which would
[SPEAKER_06]: be major pests if we were talking about a
perennial short-day system like a Manic
[SPEAKER_06]: Row.
[SPEAKER_06]: But because we're talking about
day-neutral strawberries, where we look at
[SPEAKER_06]: flowering and fruiting to occur later in
the summer and into the fall in most
[SPEAKER_06]: areas, the pest complex tends to shift a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a result of that, how we go after
these particular pests and whether or not
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going to become a problem for you,
also is affected by exactly what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: growing in when it comes on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, the same philosophy of
integrated pest management should be
[SPEAKER_06]: applied whether we're talking about
short-day plants or day-neutral plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about an integrated pest management
or IPM program, really looking at the
[SPEAKER_06]: major components that support the system,
just as Frank discussed with diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now with insects, the first of those
primary components is to actually monitor
[SPEAKER_06]: for pest populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: This means getting out there and looking
for the insects that seem to be causing
[SPEAKER_06]: the problem, if indeed that is what the
problem is being caused by.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is different than just saying,
okay, I know that two-spotted spider mites
[SPEAKER_06]: or tarnished plant bug are going to be an
issue, so I'm going to start spraying as
[SPEAKER_06]: soon as I see some flower buds out there,
and I'm going to continue on a five-day
[SPEAKER_06]: program until I start picking.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not monitoring pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just as soon as you have a problem
and growing everything you've got at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That tends to be the least cost-effective
method of going after this.
[SPEAKER_06]: A better method is to actually go out and
determine whether or not you have the pest
[SPEAKER_06]: before you go spending a lot of money on
chemicals and the equipment you need to
[SPEAKER_06]: put down.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second component is using action
thresholds to determine exactly when to
[SPEAKER_06]: spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this goes hand-in-hand with the first
part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we discover that we have some pests
out there, is it really worth going after
[SPEAKER_06]: them?
[SPEAKER_06]: That question really comes down to a
matter of economics.
[SPEAKER_06]: If, I only have one bug out there,
it is not going to cause enough damage to
[SPEAKER_06]: justify the money I would have to invest
in sprayers in my time and the sprayer
[SPEAKER_06]: itself to get out there and do anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at some point, the damage that a
number of insects are going to cause will
[SPEAKER_06]: indeed cause economic harm that will
surpass what it costs me to control it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what your action threshold is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your action threshold is just telling you
right now is the time to apply that in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't mean when the insects first
arrive, it means that when we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: wait until we're over at a level where we
can no longer tolerate them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the third component is using
alternative management methods whenever
[SPEAKER_06]: possible to keep those insects from ever
reaching the action threshold.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are some basic things we can do,
like using crop rotation, not planting
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberries in the same place year after
year, shift them around to make the
[SPEAKER_06]: insects follow you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That can keep those populations down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can also use some more
proactive things during the season,
[SPEAKER_06]: like releasing predators or parasites,
for example, to try to keep those insects
[SPEAKER_06]: suppressed so that we won't have to build
that sprayer out and those pests will
[SPEAKER_06]: never reach the action threshold.
[SPEAKER_06]: So based on those three components,
we can take a look at how to approach
[SPEAKER_06]: these pest problems that are going to
become an issue for us during the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: So looking at some things you can do to
keep those pests from ever reaching the
[SPEAKER_06]: action threshold, first and foremost,
one of the things that comes to mind is
[SPEAKER_06]: managing weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I know we're talking about insect
pests here, but the two really go hand in
[SPEAKER_06]: hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weeds are an important component of how an
insect is going to interact with your
[SPEAKER_06]: crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, just having the weeds in the
crop weakens those plants, and as a
[SPEAKER_06]: result, weak plants tend to be more
attractive to insect pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been several studies that have
shown this, depending on the species of
[SPEAKER_06]: insect that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we want to keep our plants healthy,
happy, growing, and vigorous.
[SPEAKER_06]: They become less appealing to insects in
some cases, but certainly they're better
[SPEAKER_06]: able to tolerate insect injury if they're
in good health.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not going to happen if you have
a lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, just having other plants in with
your strawberries is going to reduce the
[SPEAKER_06]: effectiveness of your pesticides because
they're going to block the materials from
[SPEAKER_06]: actually reaching the plants and getting
the good kind of coverage that you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with these newer pesticides
where the rates we're using are extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: low, you want to make sure that you're
getting very good coverage with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not only a matter of making sure
you have the best spray equipment possible
[SPEAKER_06]: to get that distribution, but making sure
there's nothing in the way that's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: block that pesticide from reaching the
target where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, of course, weeds also provide
harbors for insects.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can hide out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can winter there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about that more with the
specific insects that might have problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they act as alternate hosts.
[SPEAKER_06]: If for some reason the strawberries aren't
available, we're going into winter,
[SPEAKER_06]: or there's no fruit available,
these act as places where the insects can
[SPEAKER_06]: lay their eggs and be well protected while
you're busy spraying the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're happily producing the next round
of pests where you want to feed population
[SPEAKER_06]: at the edge of the fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crop rotation, as I mentioned earlier,
is also very important so we can prevent
[SPEAKER_06]: pest populations from building up over
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: With day neutrals, we're usually talking
about these plants only being in the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground one year.
[SPEAKER_06]: In some cases, and I know in Canada,
they're looking at carrying them on to a
[SPEAKER_06]: second year and getting a little bit of a
spring harvest off of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, weeds, we can put them on
a relatively short rotation to get out of
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberries and put some other crop in
there for a year or two, which will not
[SPEAKER_06]: encourage strawberries pests, something
that's not going to share the same host
[SPEAKER_06]: attractiveness as strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we can fumigate, as Frank mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another way of cleaning it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But fumigation has its own issues,
especially if you're an organic grower,
[SPEAKER_06]: which will bring us down to the next one,
which is managing crop and soil health.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure that the soil
fertility is good so that our plants are
[SPEAKER_06]: vigorous and healthy and can tolerate
injury that they may be subjected to.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure our organic matter
level are high so that the fertility we're
[SPEAKER_06]: adding to the soil is being properly
monitored by that soil so that the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: can have easy access to it and that it
will be held in reserve.
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't leach out for yeast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, having lots of organic
matter in the soil also increases the
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity of flora and fauna that lives in
that soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's actually a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you fumigate, you've basically
sterilized the soil so that if a bad fungi
[SPEAKER_06]: or bad soil insect pest comes in there,
they basically have no competition and can
[SPEAKER_06]: run rampant through the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas if there are other flora and fauna
in there, some of which, in fact the
[SPEAKER_06]: majority of which, are probably
beneficial, they can help the plants if
[SPEAKER_06]: not actively antagonize some of these pest
species that are coming into play.
[SPEAKER_06]: So managing that crop and soil health is a
very important part of your insect pest
[SPEAKER_06]: management strategy as well as your
disease management strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go back to the monitoring part
of this IPM program, and that involves
[SPEAKER_06]: scouting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically with a short day strawberry
plant that they flower, in the spring,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's a relatively short flowering
period, we say initiate your scouting at
[SPEAKER_06]: the flower bud stage and you'll be able to
keep up with most of the pests and try to
[SPEAKER_06]: scout them once or twice a week during
that flowering period.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about day neutrals,
however, we're going to plant them in the
[SPEAKER_06]: spring and we're usually going to pinch
those first flowers that come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no sense in really worrying
about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I'd be really worried about
early on in the season probably is mites
[SPEAKER_06]: or any of the foliar feeding insects that
may start to show themselves early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as the ones that are going to
affect us directly in the pocketbook with
[SPEAKER_06]: feeding on flowers and fruit, you probably
don't need to do that until the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: have been in the ground for about four or
five weeks and we've stopped pinching
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers and waiting for that new set of
flower buds to come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the time that we need to start
looking at things like tarnished plant bug
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been a real headache on some of
these day neutral production systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I still say you might want to do a
little bit of scouting prior to letting
[SPEAKER_06]: those flower buds come out to set fruit in
the late summertime, but pretty much your
[SPEAKER_06]: intense scouting should start with that
new set of flower buds, the first set that
[SPEAKER_06]: you intend to fruit, start showing
themselves outside of those crowns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's the best way to scout?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideally you would look at every plant in
the field, but of course that's just not
[SPEAKER_06]: practical.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we want to do is get a sample of
that field that, one, doesn't take us too
[SPEAKER_06]: much time and effort to do, but on the
other hand gives us a very good
[SPEAKER_06]: representative sample of what actually is
going on in the field as a whole.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you look at these green bars as rows
of strawberries in a field, if we were
[SPEAKER_06]: going to scout, we'd want to come through
and looking at these little stars,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can see that what we're doing here is
stopping at five locations in that field
[SPEAKER_06]: and these locations will kind of give us a
pretty good representation of what's going
[SPEAKER_06]: on in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to use the outside rows
because they tend to be biased,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if they're new patches or brush
or something like that where these pests
[SPEAKER_06]: are coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to come in a few rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nor do we want to be right at the ends of
the rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to move into the field a little
bit to, again, give us a better idea of
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is what I like to do in a field
that's, say, one and a half acres or less.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's bigger than that, I would probably
double this and go out to about 10 sites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at each site, depending on the insect,
I'm going to do different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm either going to look at a certain
length of row at each site, counting
[SPEAKER_06]: damage or counting insects, or I'm going
to be, in the case of tarnished plant bug,
[SPEAKER_06]: whacking flower blossoms and looking for
nymphs, or in the case of mites,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be actually picking leaves in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, bear in mind, when I say you stop at
one site, if I've stopped at one site and
[SPEAKER_06]: beat up a plant to look for one insect,
don't assume that that other insect that
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be looking for in a minute is
still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have to move down the row
because if you disturb the plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: you've probably changed what's going on in
terms of the pest population there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I just wanted to get you an
idea of how you should distribute your
[SPEAKER_06]: monitoring efforts through that field to
make sure that it's representative of the
[SPEAKER_06]: field as a whole.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the bottom line here is that driving by
in the pickup at 30 miles an hour and
[SPEAKER_06]: sticking your head out the window is not
adequate scouting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do need to get out in the field and
get down on your hands and knees and
[SPEAKER_06]: actually look at these plants to see if
those pests are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move on to the specific pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I said, this is just based on my
experience with day neutrals and also
[SPEAKER_06]: talking to growers that I've worked with
with day neutrals, the biggest pest
[SPEAKER_06]: problems they've had to deal with as far
as insects are concerned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tarnished plant bug keeps bubbling up to
the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about tarnished plant bug,
the damage you see here in the photo,
[SPEAKER_06]: these berries with very CDNs on them we
call apical CDNs or cat-facing button
[SPEAKER_06]: berries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tend to see quite a bit of this with
day neutrals and that's because
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately the day neutrals tend to be
flowering and fruiting right at the time
[SPEAKER_06]: when the tarnished plant bug insect pest
populations are at their peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: We deal with these in the short day plants
in the spring too, but we find with the
[SPEAKER_06]: day neutrals the pressure is even greater.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to add to our roles, we run into
control problems whereas we want to be
[SPEAKER_06]: spraying and protecting our plants when
they're in the early bloom to late bloom
[SPEAKER_06]: stage for tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: But with day neutrals, you find that you
have a lot of fruit ripe at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really want to be spraying and
harvesting at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what are your customers going to think
of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to be very careful about what
products you're selecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about management.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alternate hosts and flowering weeds play a
very important role in tarnished plant
[SPEAKER_06]: bug's ability to succeed in your field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to avoid mowing during bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk more about this in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're using insecticides, trying to
concentrate those during the pre and post
[SPEAKER_06]: bloom periods and trying to avoid going
after them at full bloom when we're hoping
[SPEAKER_06]: our pollinators are good.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at the biology of this pest,
you can see an adult there on the top
[SPEAKER_06]: photo feeding on the developing strawberry
flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the receptacle of the flower,
which is actually the part that's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: become your strawberry flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they feed on those developing achines
or seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by killing them, those seeds aren't
going to give off a growth regulator that
[SPEAKER_06]: will cause the lower part of the fruit,
the receptacle, to swell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we get that seeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: They overwinter as adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: And interestingly, we don't feel that they
do a particularly good job of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, the population that
emerges in the spring is quite a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: smaller than that that went to bed in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when those adults emerge,
the first thing they start to do is look
[SPEAKER_06]: for flowers and growing points to feed on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as soon as they fatten up a bit,
they start mating and laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they like to lay their eggs in the
leaf petioles and even the flower stems or
[SPEAKER_06]: pedicels of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just insert their eggs into the
plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they hatch in about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the little green nymphs, as you can
see in the lower photo here, will emerge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll run around and start feeding
on, again, growing points or any
[SPEAKER_06]: reproductive tissue they can find.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like to feed on growing points.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like to feed on flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because nutrition-wise, that's what's best
for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot better than plant fat.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more protein and fats in those
tissues than there are just poking into a
[SPEAKER_06]: leaf, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where they concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what you need to know about the
nymphs is that they don't fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nor do they reproduce.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fact is that if the adults lay
their eggs on the flowers and stems of a
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberry plant, when those nymphs
emerge, they've got no place else to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't fly away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're really going to concentrate
their efforts on those strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we need to keep an eye on
what the adults are doing in your field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know if there are adults there,
that soon there's going to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: little nymphs running around and feeding
and causing problems on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: These nymphs will molt four or five times
before they become adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: And until they become adults, they can't
fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't fly or reproduce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we figure there's two or three
generations per year here in the Duolingo
[SPEAKER_06]: area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although those generations are very
indistinct.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see specific peaks of
populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of overlap and run into each
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as far as monitoring goes,
there's really two techniques that are
[SPEAKER_06]: used.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is trapping, where we can just
stick up these white sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just nail them to little stakes in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those traps should be set at about the
same height as the canopy of a strawberry
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are just covered with a sticky
goo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the tarnished plant bugs happen along
and think maybe that's a nice strawberry
[SPEAKER_06]: flower and land on it and get stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with these traps is everything
else gets stuck on them, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: All different kinds of insects,
a lot of dirt and chaff, occasional small
[SPEAKER_06]: bird, mouse gets stuck on them as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't tend to be very pleasant to
work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like to use them at the edge of the
field and take a look at them once in a
[SPEAKER_06]: while.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to know what the tarnished
plant bugs look like and be able to sort
[SPEAKER_06]: them out from everything else that's on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to determine how many adults are
flying around at any given time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know what to look for when I'm
eating.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the rubber really hits the road when
we move into the strawberry field itself
[SPEAKER_06]: and start going after those nymphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the nymphs are what tend to cause
most of the injury, especially later in
[SPEAKER_06]: the season with these day-neutral
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see, this is Sonya Schloman,
my counterpart at UMass here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's taking a flower cluster in a
little white clipboard there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's just bashing a flower cluster
over the clipboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just put my hand behind it and give it
three sharp wraps over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use a white styrofoam plate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if there are any nymphs on that
flower cluster, they fall onto the plate
[SPEAKER_06]: and they run around like crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to look quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just count the nymphs that are
coming off of those flower clusters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do that to 30 flower clusters in a
field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember that map from earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were going to go to five locations
in a field, we'd want to tap six clusters
[SPEAKER_06]: at each location.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I tend to move down the row.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't tap one cluster and then go to the
one right beside it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because tarnished plant bugs are very
active and shy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I beat on one flower cluster,
I assume the one right next to it is the
[SPEAKER_06]: nymphs have already probably run off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to move down the row.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's talk about those thresholds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to use the sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say just use them to determine whether
the presence of adults is a problem or
[SPEAKER_06]: not.
[SPEAKER_06]: For most growers, I don't think it's
really practical.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more important that you get in there
and tap those flower clusters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would do this with day-neutrals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably be doing it twice a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can sample three clusters in 10
sites to get my 30 flower clusters,
[SPEAKER_06]: or six in five sites, depending on how big
your field is.
[SPEAKER_06]: My threshold is quite simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: If four of the flower clusters are
infested with nymphs out of the 30 that I
[SPEAKER_06]: tapped over my plate, or an average of a
quarter of an infant from a cluster,
[SPEAKER_06]: if that makes more sense to you,
it's time to do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't actually have to count nymphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just count the number of clusters that
were infested.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one cluster really means that I need to
do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it had four tarnished plant bugs on it,
I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to know whether four out of
the 30 had any nymphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember what you're looking for here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The nymphs can be very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just circled this little guy here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's compared to a strawberry,
a keen that you see right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can be very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing to remember is that they're
also very active.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they hit the plate, they're going to
start running, as opposed to an aphid,
[SPEAKER_06]: which can look very similar to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when an aphid's on the plate,
it's just going to sit there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't tend to move very fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So learn to know what these things look
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the long antenna.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're light green or yellowish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I say, they tend to move pretty
fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing you need to know about
them is even as they get bigger,
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at the one that's a little bigger
here, you can see the wing pads on it,
[SPEAKER_06]: their color matches strawberry pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one sitting on a strawberry sepal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's hard to see them unless you get
them onto the plate, just looking at the
[SPEAKER_06]: flower clusters.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll fall off the plant and play dead
on the ground where they're hard to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: But their color and their size are issues
for seeing them unless you use this
[SPEAKER_06]: tapping method.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what can you go with?
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many insecticides that are now
enabled for tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are pretty hot materials,
which I tend to shy away from because,
[SPEAKER_06]: if I can, because the broad-spectrum
materials, although they'll control
[SPEAKER_06]: tarnished plant bug very well,
they also tend to clean out any predators
[SPEAKER_06]: or parasites you may have, which would be
helping you with not only tarnished plant
[SPEAKER_06]: bug, but some other things, most
especially two-spotted spider mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: So things like Danatallum brigade,
which are synthetic pyrethroids,
[SPEAKER_06]: will do a good job on tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they'll pretty much clean house and
take everything else out.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, they will control
two-spotted spider mites if they happen to
[SPEAKER_06]: be there, but they'll also wipe out the
predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who are organic growers
who are looking for something,
[SPEAKER_06]: Pyganic is labeled for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has zero days to harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the number in parentheses is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can spray this today and pick
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pyganic doesn't tend to be as effective as
the synthetic pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tends to knock the adults off the
plant, but they kind of shake it off and
[SPEAKER_06]: get back up and feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's pretty much what you've got at
this point for tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dibrom, malathion, a couple of
organophosphates.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not cleared for organic use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Malathion has three days to harvest,
so you'd want to watch that with the day
[SPEAKER_06]: neutrals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, because you're probably going to
have ripe food.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just the smell of malathion is
probably enough to steer you away from it
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're going to be picking very shortly
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thionx works fairly well, but watch the
days to harvest on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, there's an odor issue with that one
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, a sale, which is a
relatively low toxicity material.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the eonicotinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does a fairly good job on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is somewhat broad-spectrum,
a little more specific than the Danitol or
[SPEAKER_06]: Brigade.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, if you're looking for a lower
toxicity material, this may be one to try.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said earlier, watch out for your
alternate hosts.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a lot of flowering weeds in
your field, as you see in the first photo
[SPEAKER_06]: here, you're going to have issues with
tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also pay attention to your mowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're mowing around the fields when
your strawberries are in flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: where do you think those things are going
to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those weeds that you're mowing probably
are harboring a lot of tarnished plant
[SPEAKER_06]: bugs as well as other insects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you take that host away,
they're going to be bouncing into your
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like to keep things fairly tightly
mowed until the strawberries are in
[SPEAKER_06]: flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I pretty much leave them alone
until the season is done.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you decide you're going to mow,
the important thing is to keep it mowed
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep it mowed close so the weeds never
have a chance to grow up in flowers that
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to be attractive to the
tarnished plant bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mow covers can be used if you're going to
carry these over and try to get a spring
[SPEAKER_06]: crop off of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Row covers work as a barrier to keep the
adults from laying eggs on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also advance the flowering date
anywhere from a week to two weeks ahead of
[SPEAKER_06]: its normal time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a result, the tarnished plant bug
overwintering adults may not be up and
[SPEAKER_06]: laying eggs at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think these are going to be really
practical for late summer and fall
[SPEAKER_06]: applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you put these over the
strawberries at that point, you're
[SPEAKER_06]: probably going to be interfering with
pollination.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be getting it too hot
under there for the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, there's probably bugs already
under there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you just put this over,
instead of acting as a barrier,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's actually going to be sitting in there
and protecting them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So think about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There may be a way to make it work for the
summer and fall crop with tarnished plant
[SPEAKER_06]: bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think this would be more in line if
you were planning on carrying these over
[SPEAKER_06]: and taking the spring crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could put these on very early in the
spring or late in the fall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just keep them on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll probably find you're getting a
little bit of management of tarnished
plant bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some biological control methods
that can be used here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The most important thing is that there are
natural predators, spiders, beetles,
[SPEAKER_06]: and things that will eat tarnished plant
bug nymphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need to encourage those by not
trying to use a lot of those broad
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum insecticides that would tend to
take them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a naturally occurring parasitoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: This little wasp that you see in the photo
here was imported from Europe and released
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Northeast and has now established
itself pretty well and has given us a
[SPEAKER_06]: natural suppression of tarnished plant
bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It parasitizes the nymphs.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it by itself hasn't given us 100%
economic control.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have noticed that in recent years
tarnished plant bug populations seem to be
[SPEAKER_06]: on the decline.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I expect this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't expect this is going to be the
complete solution to the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a fungus, Bavaria bassiana,
that commercially produces mycotrol,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is labeled for tarnished plant bug
on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Various studies with these have showed
anywhere from 40% to 60% control at best.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really depends on what the season
is like around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tends to break down very quickly in
hot, sunny weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of a program of controls with
other things, it might work fairly well.
[SPEAKER_06]: As of yet, I don't think this is on the
label.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you might want to check that if you're
organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's look at the other major one that I
wanted to cover today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's two-spotted spider mites,
which have been a big issue on some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: day-neutral production systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you see some adults and some eggs on
the picture on the left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_06]: These feed on the undersides of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are very small, as you can see in
the next photo here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got one circled.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may or may not be able to see them
with the naked eye, depending on how good
[SPEAKER_06]: your eyesight is and how used you are to
seeing these.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may want to carry a 10X hand lens to
be able to see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But by feeding on the undersides of the
leaves, they'll cause the plants to be
[SPEAKER_06]: weakened quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if populations explode, they cause a
lot of webbing and bronzing, which can
[SPEAKER_06]: extend onto the fruit and make them
unmarked.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just the fact that the plants are so
weakened, you're probably going to see
[SPEAKER_06]: reductions in size and quality as a result
of these mites feeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: These overwinter as adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they tend to be very active when the
temperatures get warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They lay their eggs on the undersides of
the leaves, as you saw in that photo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as, oops, I see my little symbols here
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Upwards arrows.
[SPEAKER_06]: As temperatures increase and food becomes
more available, they lay lots more eggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it's hot and your plants are doing
very well, especially if you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: feeding them lots of nitrogen,
you can expect spider mites can be a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the symptoms of bronzing,
yellowing of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may see some webbing on the undersides
of the leaves and then just poor vigor as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are we going to do for management
here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you can see some of the bronzing on
the leaves and some webbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, avoid stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mites are one of these pests that seem to
really enjoy stressed out plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tend to go to them first.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your plants are drought stressed,
you tend to have more problems with spider
[SPEAKER_06]: mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also noticed that the rows that are
near the dirt road where they get a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: dust, this seems to braid the leaves a
little bit and make them even more
[SPEAKER_06]: attractive to mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've noticed that in some fields in
California and Florida now, they actually
[SPEAKER_06]: put up barriers along their farm roads to
keep dust from the vehicles passing onto
[SPEAKER_06]: those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just basically form breaks there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excessive nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're putting too much nitrogen on
them, you get big, lush petioles that are
[SPEAKER_06]: covering up your fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This tends to make them more attractive to
mites, but also is going to cause problems
[SPEAKER_06]: with petritis because you're not getting
the air you put through there,
[SPEAKER_06]: as Frank talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Using row covers on your plants,
although it may be a strategy for a
[SPEAKER_06]: tarnished plant bug in some situations,
it actually will increase your risk of
[SPEAKER_06]: mites because you're creating a beautiful
form, greenhouse-like environment under
[SPEAKER_06]: there that the mites are really going to
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using row covers, make sure you
pick them up fairly regularly and take
[SPEAKER_06]: some leaves out and take a look for mites
just to make sure they're not building up
[SPEAKER_06]: in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to encourage the predators by
avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides,
[SPEAKER_06]: as we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is the possibility of releasing
predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, Eusaeulus fallacious is
another mite species, but this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: predator mite that happily feeds on the
eggs and larvae of two-spotted spider
[SPEAKER_06]: mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can release these.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy them commercially and release
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The trick to using them, however,
is to make sure that you have a population
[SPEAKER_06]: of two-spotted spider mites on your plants
before you do a release because once you
[SPEAKER_06]: release these, they need something to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you release them onto a nice,
clean field, they will die out very
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like to say, you know, make sure that
you're at threshold before you release
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't expect immediate gratification.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a while for these to get
established and give you the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we monitor for two-spotted spider
mites, we simply harvest leaves from the
[SPEAKER_06]: field and don't all concentrate on one
part of the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take 60 leaves from old leaves,
young leaves from each edge of the field
[SPEAKER_06]: and the middle of the field, and then I
just sit down at the edge of the field and
[SPEAKER_06]: I start looking at the undersides of those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, you don't have to count mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the good news.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just look and see if there are any mites
at all on the underside of that leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there is, you count that as a hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if 15 leaves out of the 60 you took,
or 25 percent of the leaves that you took
[SPEAKER_06]: have any mites on them at all,
it's time to do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this may be an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be doing a predator release.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there are some pretty good options
here for controlling two-spotted spider
[SPEAKER_06]: mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use oils only in the spring time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something you want to use in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: New foliage starts to emerge in the spring
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: A spray of sunspray or stylet oil with a
mist blower so you're getting the
[SPEAKER_06]: undersides of those leaves and getting
good coverage can actually offer pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: good control of mites and actually isn't
too harmful to predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are cleared for organic use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just looking at this photo here,
you can just see the little bit of yellow
[SPEAKER_06]: start to show on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good indication that mites are
starting to get active there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kelthane, agrimac, arabamectin,
savvy, vendex, vagrant, oberon,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of these are pretty good products.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to watch your days to harvest if
you're getting near picking time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you might want to watch odor.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want to watch odor problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might want to watch effects on
predators if you're using predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, if you notice that one side of
the field seems to be showing more damage
[SPEAKER_06]: than others or just getting started in one
place, spot treatments can be effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using predatory mites,
five to ten thousand mites per acre is
[SPEAKER_06]: what we recommend.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you get mites from your dealer,
make sure you open up the little jar they
[SPEAKER_06]: come in and take a hand lens to it and
make sure those mites are alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had several incidents of mites
arriving from your dealers without good
[SPEAKER_06]: success.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is just because sometimes
they get too hot in storage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone says my mic isn't working.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to turn it up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: See if that does any good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll finish up with a couple of
things that have shown up in a few fields,
[SPEAKER_06]: but haven't been a huge problem for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thrips, usually eastern flower thrips in
the west coast area, this might be western
[SPEAKER_06]: flower thrips, has been a problem in some
fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: These, again, are very small, almost as
small as those two-spotted spider mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: The blue arrow here points to one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a very good photo, but it does
give you an idea of the size of these if
[SPEAKER_06]: you compare it to the strawberry flower
that it's sitting on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the damage is on the right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they do is they cause bronzing
because they feed on that developing
[SPEAKER_06]: flower as it's turning into a strawberry
fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that bronzing causes the epidermal or
the skin layer of it to become relatively
[SPEAKER_06]: unable to expand, and thus we get a lot of
cracking with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thrips are one of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: They show up in some fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't show up in others.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see them some years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see them in others.
[SPEAKER_06]: We expect this because eastern flower
thrip doesn't tend to overwinter in the
[SPEAKER_06]: more northern locations of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to fly up or be blown up in storm
fronts every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a result of that, you may not get the
populations that are going to cause you
[SPEAKER_06]: economic harm every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: With thrips, we need to start scouting an
early fruit development about the time of
[SPEAKER_06]: petal fall when those petals are just
falling off the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got fruit that's, say, a quarter to
a half-inch diameter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically, what we recommend is to sample
50 fruit and just examine those four
[SPEAKER_06]: mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, for thrips.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not always easy to see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one trick is to place those fruit in a
little baggie, a Ziploc bag, and then put
[SPEAKER_06]: it in the sun for about 10, 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then those thrips will go running off
the fruit because they're getting too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can look at them with a hand lens
and start counting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your threshold, and this is based on some
work done in Canada, in a pick-your-own
[SPEAKER_06]: field, about 25 thrips for those 50 fruits
that you put in a bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: That should work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're shipping, the thrip tolerance is
quite a bit less than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd probably want to look at five thrips
for 50 fruit, and then two thrips for
[SPEAKER_06]: berry, according to research in Canada,
is going to result in about 20% injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as pesticides go, what we're
looking at here is a fairly good selection
[SPEAKER_06]: of pesticides now, especially with the new
spinosa type.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spintor, Entrust, Radiant are all used.
[SPEAKER_06]: Entrust is cleared for use for organic
growers and does offer pretty good
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: These also have zero days to harvest,
so there's no effect that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then dibrom, we've talked about that for
control of other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is fairly hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will take out most of your predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, assail, which is a
neonicotinoid, as I said, relatively low
[SPEAKER_06]: toxicity in this particular case.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to finish up with a couple things
that maybe should show up for you,
[SPEAKER_06]: sap beetles or picnic beetles,
these are small beetles that will chew
[SPEAKER_06]: holes in the sides of ripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the damage of a small beetle
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are actually several species of this
particular insect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll chew holes in the sides there,
as you see.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way around sap beetles is to harvest
regularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: These insects key in on overripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure your pickers are not just
picking the fruit that are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: market, but removing any overripe fruit
from the field or rotten fruit from the
[SPEAKER_06]: field as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people have used traps of rotten
fruit on the edge of the field to try to
[SPEAKER_06]: draw the beetles out and into those piles
of trapped fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they can either treat that or
just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing with insecticides here is you're
going to be going after fruit that's
[SPEAKER_06]: fairly ripe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really need to watch your days to
harvest for these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brigade, Danitol will work fairly well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, you're using a fairly hot
insecticide here that's going to hurt your
[SPEAKER_06]: predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pyganic is cleared for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, assail, which is,
again, that new neonicotinoid with
[SPEAKER_06]: relatively low toxicity in one day to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some recent research coming out of
Florida and some other areas has shown
[SPEAKER_06]: they've got very good results.
[SPEAKER_06]: With this particular insect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a question on the oils for burning
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we use it in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to use the oils during the
summertime or you will get burning.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to use it early in the spring.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the sequence of mitisides to
delay mite resistance, I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a specific sequence here.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would be more inclined to do is
shake up the chemistry as you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: through.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, you might want to use
something that's relatively specific,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a Vendex, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then move over to something with
different chemistry, like Omite or Savi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly, one of the best mitisides out
there is three days of cold and rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, that won't do much for your
botrytis control measures.
[SPEAKER_06]: But mites are actually very susceptible to
just having good moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real trick with mitisides,
again, is making sure you have good
[SPEAKER_06]: coverage and that your sprayer is getting
the undersides of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: The threshold of five spider mites per
leaf, I don't like.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me count mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I prefer to go with 25% of leaves
infested.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't count mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just flip the leaves over and look at
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's one mite or 20 mites,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I count that leaf as infested.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if 25% of the total sample of
leaves are infested, that's the time you
[SPEAKER_06]: should be spraying.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's finish up with potato leafhopper.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one that can be a problem in some
areas in some years, similar to what we
[SPEAKER_06]: talked about with thrips.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tends to like to move on to new plants,
which is why we tend to see it be a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem on some plantings of day-neutral
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we see with this particular
insect is what we call hopper burn.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the twisted growth, the yellowing
on the edges of the leaves here.
[SPEAKER_06]: These insects feed on the undersides of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time they're feeding,
they inject toxins into that leaf,
[SPEAKER_06]: which causes this distorted growth and
generally weakens the plants quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're on the undersides of
leaves, similar to two-spotted spider
[SPEAKER_06]: mites, we need to get really good coverage
of the foliage in order to make sure that
[SPEAKER_06]: this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scouting-wise, basically all I do is start
looking for this injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: This injury is often mistaken for
herbicide injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: People say, oh, I put too much dule down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, oh, I put too much something else
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when in fact what they've got is these
hoppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really what you need to do is just brush
the leaves with your hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see a bunch of little white hoppers
fly out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can look at the undersides and look
for those nymphs that we saw in the
[SPEAKER_06]: previous slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need good coverage, as I said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, there are some pretty good
materials cleared for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Malathion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, watch your days to harvest in odor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven, again, you need to watch your days
to harvest on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not something to use if you're going to be
picking right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, Provado and Aseal,
two neonicotinoids with one day to
[SPEAKER_06]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Relatively low toxicity and probably the
best products for this particular
[SPEAKER_06]: situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: A spittle bug can become an issue,
especially if you've got a weedy field or
[SPEAKER_06]: lots of clover around the place that's
going to attract these things in.
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually isn't an economic problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more a problem for your pickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it depends on how you're running your
operation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in New England, we have some growers
who are actually using day neuters to pick
[SPEAKER_06]: your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pickers are really not going to
like spittle masses in amongst the fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And their hands get covered with this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Commercially, again, your pickers aren't
going to be very happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you may be able to work around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just little insects with
piercing, sucking mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they're feeding, they exude this
foam around them to protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes it very unpleasant to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, we consider one spittle mass
per foot to be an economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your tolerance may actually be less than
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you need really good coverage with
your insecticides for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brigade, Malathion will do a pretty good
job.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, look at that label for Provado
and Aseal where you've got a relatively
[SPEAKER_06]: low toxicity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully, you're only going to have
to be applying these materials once.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have to worry about going on
and on again and building resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we were concerned about that,
you might want to switch to Viganic for a
[SPEAKER_06]: spray or go to one of the more specific
ones like Danitol.
[SPEAKER_06]: White grubs, I don't expect white grubs to
be a huge problem unless you're going into
[SPEAKER_06]: fields that have previously been sod.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using cover crops that can
contain a lot of grasses or you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: into land that you've had in hay for a
while and you turn this land over and then
[SPEAKER_06]: plant your day neuters into it,
you may start seeing some plants going
[SPEAKER_06]: down because of white grubs feeding on the
roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the larvae of Japanese beetles,
rose chafers, and various other species
[SPEAKER_06]: that feed on the roots of these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants will just wilt and collapse.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pull them up to look at the roots,
you'll discover that you don't have any
[SPEAKER_06]: roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those roots will be cut off about a half
inch below the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, it's commonly a turf pest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one that really, if you're doing
a good job of managing your cover crops
[SPEAKER_06]: and avoiding having lots of grass species
in there, if you know you've got rub
[SPEAKER_06]: problems and some of these beetles or
Japanese beetle problems around,
[SPEAKER_06]: keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't plant into freshly turned sods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rotate out of any of those plants for two
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recommend the Bacillus papillae
milky spore, at least here in the
[SPEAKER_06]: northeast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't proven to be very effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we do have some of the newer
insecticide chemistry registered for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Myer is registered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be applied as a soil application
when we're going to get rain or you can
[SPEAKER_06]: irrigate it in to get it down to those
grubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will do a fairly good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is something that probably should
be done right after planting if you expect
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to have a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyclamen mite.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had this as an issue on some
strawberry plants in the short day
[SPEAKER_06]: category.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't expect it to be a huge problem
on day neutrals unless you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: carry those over again to get the spring
crop on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: These usually come in on nursery stock,
but they take one or two years to get
[SPEAKER_06]: established and start seeing the injury
that you see in this photo here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The leaves are very small, curved,
and the plants tend to be very unthrifty
[SPEAKER_06]: and yield hardly any fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: These mites are very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need at least a 20x hand lens to see
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better to get them under a dissecting
scope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they reside down in the crown of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't just look at the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to pull this plant apart,
take some unfolded leaves from down in the
[SPEAKER_06]: crown and get them under the scope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Miteicides will work on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest problem is getting it down to
where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means you have to drench this
product to make sure that product's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be carried down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe applying it and putting on some
irrigation afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: These can be difficult to control.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot of insecticides out
there that will do a real good job on
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, all that's cleared is thionx
and, let's see, thionx, chelphane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, watch your odor issues with
chelphane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got three days to harvest on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a new product called Portal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Price down in Florida has done some
work on this one and has been very pleased
[SPEAKER_06]: with it for cyclone mite.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you suspect you have cyclone mite,
I would strongly recommend you call your
[SPEAKER_06]: county extension or your small fruit
specialist to come out and have a look at
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure that there isn't something else
going on out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is one that would be a little
unusual on the day neutrals.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's certainly not possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clipper beetle, I see we're running short
on time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to push things here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't expect Clipper would be a problem
for you on day neutrals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Except, again, if you're going to carry
these plants over and try to get a spring
[SPEAKER_06]: crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going for the spring crop,
then Clipper could be an issue for you in
[SPEAKER_06]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going through and clipping the flower buds
off, as you see in this picture here just
[SPEAKER_06]: behind the open flower bud clipped off.
[SPEAKER_06]: By rotating your plantings, moving
alternate hosts such as wild strawberries
[SPEAKER_06]: and brambles around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then pre-bloomed insecticides can give
you good control of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If those flowers start opening in the
spring, you see little holes in the petals
[SPEAKER_06]: like you see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an indication that these bugs are
active.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a Clipper on a flower bud starting
to feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: After they've fed on the pollen for a
while and gotten fat and happy,
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll go down and start clipping buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here, see if my circle comes in,
here you can see a clipped bud just
[SPEAKER_06]: clipped below it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We scout for this by looking at all the
plants in a two-foot area.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see this two-foot frame we have in
five locations of the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We count all the clipped buds in that
little frame.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we see is that if more than one
bud per sampling site is clipped,
[SPEAKER_06]: we would generally recommend control.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you notice that this is coming
in on one side of the field, and usually
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the side of the field that has a lot
of brambles or woods associated with it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can just spray the six rows in from
there, and you'll probably find you're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting pretty good control.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the field has a history of clipper
injury, you're probably going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: dealing with this every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're further south and you're
rotating this field every two or three
[SPEAKER_06]: years with day newtons, you're unlikely to
see this as a major problem for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to finish up there,
and the bottom line here is with any of
[SPEAKER_06]: these pests, you really need to know what
your pest is and what your management
[SPEAKER_06]: options are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you ever have any questions about
what's going on, out there, rather than
[SPEAKER_06]: run for a general broad-spectrum spray to
try to solve the problem, first call your
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit specialist or your cooperative
extension office.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have it properly identified and learn what
all the options are, and not only how it's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to affect this pest, but how it's
going to affect the impact on other pests
[SPEAKER_06]: and any predators or parasites that might
be out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Places you can go for more information
would be the Strawberry Production Guide
[SPEAKER_06]: or NRase 88 that's available through nrase
.org or through Cornell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or through probably any extension office
that deals with small fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: For you organic growers, there is an
Organic Production Guide from ATRA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Cornell's putting one together
for strawberries as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're updating one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you who are in New
England, the New England Small Fruit Pest
[SPEAKER_06]: Management Guide, you can access that
online at this website.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, if you're just curious as to
what some particular symptoms are and you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have ready access to a live person,
you can go onto the Cornell Berry
[SPEAKER_06]: Diagnostic Key and they have some very
good photos there that you can track down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like this or it looks like that
and get a pretty good idea of what is
[SPEAKER_06]: going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, Kathy, do you want me to
start hitting, Frank and I to start
[SPEAKER_06]: hitting up the questions or how do you
want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of questions that you
missed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben is asking about neem oil in terms of
miticide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any experience with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, neem oil is a miticide is at best
what I would call have some suppressant
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically what you're trying to do is
change the flavor of that particular plant
[SPEAKER_06]: to the mite in this case.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some growers who've had only fair
luck with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For my money, I would probably invest,
if I was an organic grower, I would
[SPEAKER_06]: probably be more likely to invest in some
predators.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'd have better luck with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, it's a suppressant.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're really in trouble and you have a
lot of mites out there, it is not going to
[SPEAKER_06]: take care of the problem for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you wanted to put it on as a matter of
course to try to keep small populations
[SPEAKER_06]: small, you may get some impact that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Becky Sideman is asking for tarnished
plant bug management and day neutrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you can't avoid mowing all summer,
would you recommend very tight mowing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vicinity of fields to remove habitat?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sorry, I thought I had said
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can either mow up until the time of
flowering and then call it quits and not
[SPEAKER_06]: mow from then on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just keep mowing and mow tight
throughout the season so that those plants
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're mowing don't have a chance to
get up and form flower buds that are going
[SPEAKER_06]: to become more attractive to the tarnished
plant bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's either don't mow or if you do mow,
mow very regularly to keep that vegetation
[SPEAKER_06]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raymond from Poland is asking about a
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's effectively on the nymphs and thionx,
both nymphs and adults?
[SPEAKER_06]: A sale is most effective on the nymphs but
it will also take the adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thionx is going to wipe the slate clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take out both the nymphs and
the adults, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thionx has more of a knockdown than a sale
but both of them are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other questions for either
Frank or David?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give them a chance to comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, I just want to thank both of
you for participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciated your presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a shift in focus
starting with next week's webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at emerging
pests, ID and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be three webinars in this series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next week we'll hear from Dr. Tracy
Leske from USDA ARS Appalachian Fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to be talking to us about
brown marmorated stink bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be hearing from Mr. Stephen
Coyke from University of California
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperative Extension Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be talking to us about
fusarium and charcoal crown rots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two others in the series are both also
looking at disease and insect management
[SPEAKER_00]: and we hope that you'll find these as
informative as the ones that we've had on
[SPEAKER_00]: day-neutral strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other questions before we
sign off for the week?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right then, thank you very much both
David and Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate you helping us out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome Kathy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been great to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
you
