[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Sarah, for hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks all of you for hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, coming back to Ithaca, coming to
Cornell has a bit of a nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a graduate student at NC State,
I used to come to Cornell very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very often and have spent a lot of time in
these buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be back, and especially
for your hospitality and for organizing
[SPEAKER_00]: such a wonderful weather that suits so
well to my Indian skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to sort of start with,
if I know how to operate this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start with a small story that
many of you may have heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a story from maybe, I don't know,
1,500 years ago when there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: televisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like 1,500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no televisions, and no radios,
and no media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were pretty siloed in their
little countries wherever they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those days, something like this,
an animal like this landed, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Ithaca, where nobody had ever seen
an elephant before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people started looking at this huge,
big thing that came and landed here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different people had different
interpretation about and describing this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who saw it from the top thought it
was a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who saw it from the tail side
thought it was a rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people thought it was a pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people who saw it from that side
thought it was a big, huge pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest problem is that different
people had different views in identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different people had different
interpretation of what this whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest challenge was that they did
not see it in a holistic way and looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the elephant as an elephant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did not recognize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all would agree that a lot of
the work that we do in agriculture right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at it from many, many different
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in the private sector,
for example, from a vantage point of one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fastest growing business in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the seed industry,
for example, we know why these large
[SPEAKER_00]: mergers are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last week, for example, one of the
largest merger, there is tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: potential in the private sector in the way
agriculture is growing, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a business proposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the seed industries,
for example, which is at about 53 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, is in five years projected to
be at about 93.6 billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this growth is mainly going to
come from developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at the private sector
angle, they look at it from a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: business opportunity perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the large NGO and CSO
sectors, which is very, very active in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture in developing countries,
they look at it more from a rural
[SPEAKER_00]: development angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the large number of rural people
whom these NGOs and CSOs work with also
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to be farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are doing health work in rural
area, if you are doing social benefit work
[SPEAKER_00]: in rural area, agriculture becomes very
important as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, often it is seen from that
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at from the public sector or
the government perspective of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, policies and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's face it, one of the biggest
thing is a large portion of their voters
[SPEAKER_00]: also have happened to be people who are
dependent on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a political angle also,
and from a food security angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: this becomes an extremely important
proposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the elections around the
world in last four years, which is recent
[SPEAKER_00]: elections in many countries, 57 countries
have had agriculture as their main issue
[SPEAKER_00]: of elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, is because of the
dependence of a large number of people in
[SPEAKER_00]: these countries on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, agriculture becomes a
major, major agenda for the political
[SPEAKER_00]: parties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an R&D perspective, of course,
there are a large number of challenges to
[SPEAKER_00]: be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, and I'll talk about that a
little more, especially increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a different angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the farmers,
especially in the developing country
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, the way they look at agriculture,
and contrary to a lot of the governments
[SPEAKER_00]: even believing, I always say farmers don't
farm because they are concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: country's food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers farm because they see this as a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often a lot of these people,
especially CSO, public sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: and often R&D angle sort of forgets that
angle that the farmer looks at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a farmer, it is marketable product
that they are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really not interested in anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers around the world grow it as an
important source of their livelihood,
[SPEAKER_00]: often an only source of their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know from a large number of
studies that most of the developing
[SPEAKER_00]: countries farmers remain in agriculture
because they don't have any other option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the efforts that we do
through any of these stakeholders will
[SPEAKER_00]: have to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to, and I wanted to do it
more as a discussion point because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a lot of knowledge in this room
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to sort of, as much as I can,
open this up and talk about these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I wanted to talk
about is taking India as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just taking an overview of Indian
agriculture, where it stands right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are the key challenges from all
these different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tempted to bring this because Sarah
told me this is going to be a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and genetic seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, I wanted to bring a non
productivity angle to the seminar and to,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, talk about more from a client
perspective, from a farmer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to, summing up all these
ideas that we've been thinking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have completely sort of revamped our
agriculture investment strategy as Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: and Melinda Gates Foundation, especially
for India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd like to talk a little bit about
that and what our focus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas and how it has shifted, kind of to
respond to some of these big changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about throughout the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So India is about to become the most
populated country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture continues to remain a backbone
of India's economy, despite of the large
[SPEAKER_00]: growth where the country is moving at the
pace of, say, 7%, 7.5% economic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture remains at about 2.5%,
2.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, because of the large number of
people dependent on agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rural economies of India continues to
remain very, very dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not very different from many
other developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But India, it is really unique because if
you look at generally the history,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the country progresses, the farm sizes
have increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many, many countries around the world,
we have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, for some reason, we are not
seeing that phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In last 40 years, the farm size,
or the land holding, has actually halved
[SPEAKER_00]: from 2.3% to about 1.2% now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is going to continue for quite some
time as an low-input, low-output
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the numbers that it has, 1 fourth of
the world's farming population lives in
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you say, every fourth farmer in the
world is an Indian farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a large number of farming population,
large number of people dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture as an important or only source
of their livelihood is what is making it
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other unique feature about India,
and that's again something that we will
[SPEAKER_00]: have to remember while designing our
research programs or while designing our
[SPEAKER_00]: policies, is the prevalence of mixed
farming system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no such thing as crop farmer or
livestock farmer in a country like India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all mixed farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers do it mainly as their risk
mitigation strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at a typical average
Indian farm, and this is something I
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly remind my colleagues at the
foundation also, that anything we say
[SPEAKER_00]: about India, the opposite view also could
be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very difficult to generalize
anything about this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, generally speaking, on an
average, it is all mixed farming system,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there is typically a 1.2 hectares of
land and 1 livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a cow, it could be a buffalo,
or it could be the average is 2.2 goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of mixed farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, when you look at it from a
farmer's perspective, the farmer is not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for a crop solution or a livestock
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer is looking for a combined
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a large number of our R&D efforts,
a large number of our policy effort misses
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out on that vantage point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit more about that
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDP growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very interesting that,
as I said, the country's agriculture is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at the rate of about 2.5%,
2.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The country's generally economic growth
has crossed about 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the demand for food is
increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the demand and with the income,
the kind of food people are asking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take an example of livestock,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, India's policy making
itself and the international perception
[SPEAKER_00]: about the country was that this is
predominantly a vegetarian country,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why the livestock sector is not
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The income levels changing has completely
proven us wrong in that perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: The livestock sector growth, for example,
in the country has doubled than the
[SPEAKER_00]: general agriculture growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the demand for meat in the country has
increased at the rate of 8% to 12% in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last five years, depending upon which
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were not predominantly
vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of any religious biases,
larger number of people were vegetarian
[SPEAKER_00]: because they could not afford
non-vegetarian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now with those income levels rising,
there is a big demand in that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the demand went up to a level where,
for example, since last three years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: India became the world's largest exporter
of meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrary to the belief that this is a
vegetarian country, that entire thing has
[SPEAKER_00]: shifted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little land, the last point,
very little land, very little agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: resources like water, but a large
population which is growing and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: very large number of world's 15%
livestock, that little land and that water
[SPEAKER_00]: has to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the opportunities and
some of the challenges that one has to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, the dependence on
agriculture in the country, if you compare
[SPEAKER_00]: it with China, for example, the dependence
on agriculture has been reducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in India, that has not made a
major, major change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is slowly decreasing, but still
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where more than half of the country's
population depends on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compare it, say, for example,
with some of these countries, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: why from a policy perspective,
from a politician's perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a private sector angle, from all
these NGOs, CSOs, why would agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: mean so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just because of agriculture as
farming, but because of the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the years, given all these
population challenges and all that also,
[SPEAKER_00]: the country has really come a long way in
becoming one of the top agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: producers of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is remarkable where it has come in
terms of its rice and wheat and vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulses and all these productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been a remarkable progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm reminded, especially because
I'm standing in a plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics department, that all these large
numbers and all this growth predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the large number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not come from productivity
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity still remains at one of the
lowest in the world in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is just these large numbers that is
driving this production and the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I would say that the production
of India, the output is very, very high,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not call the Indian agriculture
system as an effective or sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to take two major areas
where what has driven mainly those big
[SPEAKER_00]: data that you saw and what has brought the
country to a level of being one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders in agriculture production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I also wanted to
visit two factors that has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge as well for the country and
which we continue to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I especially wanted to bring it
because a lot of other countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially countries in East Africa and so
forth, are trying to take these paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a large number of lessons
that are hidden from the India story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green revolution in India, as we know
from 60s to 90s, this was really truly a
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionary thing where the country's
wheat and rice production went up by 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a remarkable progress in
terms of the food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 50s, from being, they used to call
it ship-to-mouth country, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: country was dependent on agriculture
import, this was one huge policy change,
[SPEAKER_00]: the green revolution, that brought the
country to a food exporting state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a remarkable progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mainly through large number of
technology adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was especially the seed technology
adoption and added with a large extension
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts, but a very, very
public-dominated, government-dominated
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution that brought about that huge
change that you see, that steep curve in
[SPEAKER_00]: the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then came the dairy revolution,
which was about 40 years ago now,
[SPEAKER_00]: where India became the largest producer of
milk in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was, again, a revolutionary thing
in the livestock sector, but only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle sector, in the dairy sector,
which, again, was very, very remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a significant impact also on
the consumption pattern, where people were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting only about 111 grams per day in
74.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went more than double by 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a huge, and despite of the
population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second one was the white revolution
that brought about some of those numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in both these revolutions,
the focus was the production by mass
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the major difference between
an industrial country bringing in their
[SPEAKER_00]: production level high and this kind of a
country bringing in a production high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity continues to remain a major
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the numbers that is driving
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the comparison between
green revolution and white revolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to open this up at this point
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to bring a few pointers
and wanted to have some brainstorming with
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys, because I know some of you know
these stories very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to open up to talk about
a little more into comparing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the green revolution,
it was public sector driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you look at the white
revolution, it was farmer cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically a people's moment,
the white revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government, of course, was very,
very involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't dominated by the policies,
or it wasn't the government driven thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just coming from Sarah's program on
the Alliance for Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about the third one
which came up, which was the cotton growth
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people in India like to call it
as the gene revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at that as a revolution,
if you look at the prevalence of
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic cotton in a country like India,
if you want to call it like a gene
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution, that was predominantly private
sector driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so interesting in the same kind of
country, in the same kind of a format,
[SPEAKER_00]: how different revolutions had different
impacts at different levels, and how all
[SPEAKER_00]: three were completely a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: A public sector led, a farmer led,
a people moment, a cooperative led,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a completely private sector led
revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green revolution was very production
centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only about increasing the
production, come what may, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes, let's just increase the production
of the country to be able to come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that import dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very, very production centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the milk revolution or the
white revolution, it was market centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire focus was not on production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire focus was on market
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give all these large number of men
and women, especially women, a market
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us create that market base where they
can aggregate their milk, and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: sell their milk, and create that market
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else, production, animal
health, all those things will follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a very market centric
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say production centric in green
revolution, market, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the buyer in those days, and buyer
even now, remains the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the predominant buyer of the
green revolution products from the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmer did not have to worry about
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was only the production aspect,
whereas here it was market aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both focused on limited number of
commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of our revolutions has been
multi-commodity revolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green revolution focused only on two
commodities mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milk revolution, of course, focused only
on milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both, interestingly, in a large
country like India, focused on a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very set small area of geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green revolution focused only in three
or four states in the northern part of
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not worry about anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white revolution focused only on two
or three states in the western part of
[SPEAKER_00]: India, and did not worry about anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were the two very, very dynamic,
but two revolutions, same country,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stop here for a while and get some
discussion here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So
[SPEAKER_00]: the white revolution, as I said,
was a very grassroot level program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the green revolution, I have a
fascinating story that my professor who
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be very associated with Cornell
also, M.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swaminathan, who worked with Norman
Borlaug to bring the green revolution to
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Swaminathan tells a very fantastic
story where he says, the then prime
[SPEAKER_00]: minister of India, Indira Gandhi,
had come to a trip to the US and had some
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings in Washington, DC, asking the US
government, who was the main supplier of
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat to India in those days, to reduce
the price further of what they are sending
[SPEAKER_00]: to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever happened in that diplomatic
meeting, Mrs. Gandhi came back to India at
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 8.30, she called a meeting of her
agriculture minister and a few people and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, whatever it takes, I don't care for
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care for sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how many people you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the food production in this country
to go up, and I'm giving you 10 years for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an extremely strong political will,
I think, was under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, an extreme need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like a crisis situation that
brought it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the history of India, this is the
first time the agriculture scientists of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country, the top agriculture
scientists of the country, were reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to the prime minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of, I think, political
will it required.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're most welcome to add to this and
not just ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question on the white
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so little?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I wanted to talk about
when I say what did not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has been one of the
biggest challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've paid a price for these revolutions
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to briefly talk about that
also in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for raising the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meat revolution, again,
is just because of the large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle that are addressing the milk need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very little government
involvement, really, in that export
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several perceptions now with
some of those religious biases of whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not we can export beef or not,
or whether or not we can actually kill a
[SPEAKER_00]: cow or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it's very interesting because at
least 58% of our milk comes from buffaloes
[SPEAKER_00]: and not cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a large amount of meat that you see
getting exported is predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: buffaloes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as I said, buffalo is a very big
part of the dairy sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know there has been several
groups at Cornell historically also
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in some of these India's
revolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you would like to add would be
great as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was public sector involvement in
green revolution, as I said, and farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers themselves aggregating together
and doing this and making it world's
[SPEAKER_00]: largest farmer cooperative moment was
behind the white revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of international that
technology played an extremely important
[SPEAKER_00]: role also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green revolution, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's interesting because white
revolution was, as I said, was not
[SPEAKER_00]: production driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was market driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were limited technology facets as
it began.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, of course, as the farmers saw
more value to their markets, they had more
[SPEAKER_00]: money to spend on their cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the vaccination started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the animal health investment started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the genesis of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in case of green revolution,
the IR8 rice variety, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the draft wheat variety, all those
technologies actually came with the
[SPEAKER_00]: support of Ford Foundation and Rockefeller
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Norman Borlaug who kind of
brought those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very, very technology oriented
and with absolute international support.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the technology is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to briefly bring in and
sort of revisit both these revolutions and
[SPEAKER_00]: then connect it to some of India's modern
day agriculture problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps, with a threat of sounding too
abrupt, connecting them with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations that these revolutions brought
to the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your question, green revolution had a
very, very isolated impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had huge impact on those isolated
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the country got a big win
in increasing its production and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in those days, it started in
isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to date, today, even after all these
years also, we have not been successful in
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing those revolutionary productions,
both in case of green revolution and in
[SPEAKER_00]: white revolution, to other parts of India,
which actually needs it much more now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had impact on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see the agriculture technology
adoption rate, if you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity angle, so I don't want to
deny that productivity is not a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in the coexistence of
different system in a country like India,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are different trajectories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a very, very high input,
high output agriculture in the country
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But predominantly, the country remains
very low input, low output type
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are major differences in
productivity within the state also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same rice variety, for example,
one of the most popular one, the Pusa
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, in Punjab, which was a green
revolution state, would be about 6.8 tons
[SPEAKER_00]: per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same Pusa variety, the same rice in a
place in Bihar, for example, would hardly
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in a productivity of about 2.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the country, there are huge
disparities in terms of productivity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same kind of agro-climatic regions or
with the same kind of varieties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green revolution, so interestingly,
and that's why we often call green
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution as grain revolution,
because it focused only on two crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was very important for food
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it focused only on rice and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture diversity, a large number of
other crops have really paid a price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the third most important,
which is pulses, has really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: suffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, a sort of paradox where
India is the world's largest producer of
[SPEAKER_00]: pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: India is the world's largest consumer of
pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And India is also the world's largest
importer of pulses right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case of pulses, we are almost in that
kind of a pre-green revolution era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you will see, a large number of
the country's efforts, up to about 83% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country's efforts now, go only on two
crops, rice and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to sort of keep the revolution
going, keep the hard-earned food security
[SPEAKER_00]: moving, and also because of the large
subsidies that the government offered to
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers to be able to grow rice and
wheat, and the large procurement program
[SPEAKER_00]: that the government had to buy from the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you make a political promise,
it is very difficult to withdraw from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 80% of the country's spending on
agriculture is actually going towards only
[SPEAKER_00]: two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, a lot of the other crops
are really suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest implications of
that is India has become food secure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nutrition remains one of the biggest
challenge of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on one hand, we are talking about India
being one of the top most, one of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: agro-producers of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the malnutrition level,
it hosts the world's largest number of
[SPEAKER_00]: malnutrient people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that imbalance came from extreme
revolution in sorting out one problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I jumped the gun a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know this lie was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, malnutrition continues
to remain a challenge in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is also due to those
kind of cereal-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, if we look at in terms of
crops, there has been three major policy
[SPEAKER_00]: pivots in the country so far in the
history of independent India.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was the Green Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second was the FCI, which is the Food
Corporation of India, where the government
[SPEAKER_00]: was promising procuring and buying from
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government would set up prices and buy
from the farmers because they saw that the
[SPEAKER_00]: market was the biggest challenge for the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started procuring from the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third more recent one was the Food
Bill of India, where the country committed
[SPEAKER_00]: something like $3 billion a year and said,
we are promising almost free, extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidized food to at least 60% of the
country, which was a very, very ambitious
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became the world's largest public
distribution system plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three, the Green Revolution,
the FCI, and the Food Bill of India,
[SPEAKER_00]: all three major reforms of agriculture in
India have focused predominantly only on
[SPEAKER_00]: two crops, rice and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that none of that has really
contributed to the malnutrition challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly, if we look at,
again, as I said, in a diverse country
[SPEAKER_00]: like India, where there are such large
number of wealth quantiles, it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to generalize that so-and-so
village is more malnutrient, so-and-so is
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This quantile of wealth people are less
malnutrient and not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at this light brown bar,
it kind of has a difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: top quantile, which means the wealthiest
people of India, and the fifth being the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest, which is the poorest of the poor
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the cereal consumption,
it is almost constant across the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: quantile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means the richest man of India and
the poorest man or a woman of India,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of cereals, rice and wheat,
that they have access to, there is not
[SPEAKER_00]: much difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences comes in all the
diversities, in the excess they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables and legumes and meat and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the problem doesn't lie
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of even distribution and
excess is a huge success of green
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the uneven success that came from
non-cereals is a drawback of green
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a country where, as we know,
53% of the people depend on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge dependence on locally
grown and locally sourced food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, agriculture and nutrition
linkage in India is one of the strongest
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people basically eat what they
grow or what their neighbor produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, perhaps as an implication of the
white revolution and also as a byproduct
[SPEAKER_00]: of country's economic growth and income
level changing, the livestock sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, is really making huge shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the total output of
livestock product in the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is more than all grains combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the livestock sector, again,
has grown almost on its own, only meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: the demand and farmers sort of responding
to the demand in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can see, the livestock sector in
the country is growing at the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agriculture sector is now at 2.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, one of the impacts of white
revolution and the potential that the
[SPEAKER_00]: dairy sector offers, even today,
even if the livestock sector is growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and because of the large amount of money
of the government spend going into cereals
[SPEAKER_00]: and other commodities, as you can see,
the spend on the livestock is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a sector that is growing double
than this sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sector that is employing now
almost double number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this sector, and yet, you can see
that the policy or the government spend is
[SPEAKER_00]: so much more on cereals and very little on
livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the livestock spend, 87% of the
livestock spend goes on dairy sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: India has a large other sector,
such as, for example, the goat sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is growing at the rate of 12% right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 89%, 90% of the goat rearing is done by
rural women, landless rural women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, huge livelihood impact,
huge rural development and social
[SPEAKER_00]: implications to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is very little policy
attention to that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have prioritized that as one of our
major investment areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recognizing that productivity is a
challenge, I really wanted to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorm with you and say that increase
in productivity, increase in production in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the crops is not going to be the
answer, because that's not what the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are looking for also.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several things that needs to be
combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have historically seen that our
efforts in plant productivity has not
[SPEAKER_00]: really realized to its full value,
mainly because it has not been clubbed
[SPEAKER_00]: with several other extremely important
factors that the plant productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts needs to hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said again, reminding you that this
is one of the fastest moving countries of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the agro leaders in the
world and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the extension or the
knowledge to the farmers, the average is
[SPEAKER_00]: 40, which means only 40% of the Indian
farmers have access to any extension
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the biggest challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technology development is an extremely
important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with only 40% getting some access to
extension knowledge or so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: how is the technology going to reach to
the farm is going to be very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see the Indian R&D system,
the Indian Council for Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: Research, their rate is only 11% of the
technologies that they develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think, again, still is an
overestimate from their side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me quote them.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11% of the agriculture technologies that
they develop reaches to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest all remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly because of this gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting angle to how India has
changed is extremely fast feminization of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an economy where off farm job
opportunities are growing, where roads are
[SPEAKER_00]: being built and constructions are
happening everywhere and urbanization is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving very fast and things like that,
agriculture more and more is being taken
[SPEAKER_00]: over by women farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our policies, our R&D systems,
the products that we develop in the labs
[SPEAKER_00]: are often not ready for this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a big mismatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between those two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a policy angle, there are major
challenges because for a policymaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who owns the land is considered
to be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of the agriculture reforms or any
of the subsidy, any of these things goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to people who own the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women, despite of over 40% of agriculture
workers, work in India done by women,
[SPEAKER_00]: the total land owned by women is less than
5% in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a major challenge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the extension services,
which I spoke about earlier, less than 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Indian women, about 40% of the
farmers have access to technology or
[SPEAKER_00]: extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case of women, it is less than 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the major pivots that
the country is making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever efforts we do within the
country and from an international angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have to keep some of these major
factors in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to very briefly talk about
the end user or the client of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding efforts, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The efforts that we make in an
international lab or so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately, I think it is very important
to know who the client is and where it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these numbers that you see are the
average number of a farmer in Bihar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not made up numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are real state level averages that
they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the farm income,
it is $30 per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the average income people make out
of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the consumption
patterns, about 30% of what people produce
[SPEAKER_00]: is used in the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rest, whatever is there, is used for
generating income out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see from a farmer's perspective,
what happens is, let me take an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: a dairy farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are no dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I look at the example of this
farmer's cow, about 70% of the money that
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to spend on that cow goes in buying
feed or in feeding the animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the more I spend on the agriculture
input, less is my margin on the
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, that is fundamental reason
why the farmer's adoption rate on
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture technologies, such as new
seeds, new breeder varieties, animal
[SPEAKER_00]: health, agro inputs, are less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, of course, there is no appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that margin between how much you
are spending to produce your crop or
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock and how much you are earning
from that is getting lower and lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fundamental reason why
technology adoption becomes such a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to map the major
constraint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, a farmer's perspective,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the major constraints in
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day, 2,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave farming in a country like India.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a predominantly agriculture country
like India, 2,000 people are leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main reason is, we see it from a
productivity angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it from a climate change angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it from a lot of angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a farmer, there is only one reason,
that there is no profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can make more money constructing
somebody's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the predominant reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we look at it from a farmer's
perspective, these are the farmer's key
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why they think that it is becoming very
difficult for them to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at it from a productivity
angle, where a lot of the government and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of R&D focuses, these are the only two
things which are related to productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest are all mostly non-farm,
nothing to do with agriculture kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market related and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: India is one of the largest investors in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spends something like $22 billion on
its agriculture sector, which is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the largest in developing world.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look at where that money is
going, the sizes of these circles
[SPEAKER_00]: represent, and it is from an analysis of
all the different government programs and
[SPEAKER_00]: government schemes, the largest amount of
money is going in crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you can please remember the
previous slide and look at the farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: perception, this was a very, very small
part of the challenge that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major part of the challenge was
extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there is very limited effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a major mismatch between the
whole puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, when we say R&D,
technologies are extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would really like to see
technologies, not just from a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity or production angle,
but I would like to see it from a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: wider angle to talk about what are the
various technologies that one can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, market access for nutrition
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market access, for example, having all
these challenges, I spoke about the Bihar
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer and their challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite of all those challenges and
despite of earning only $30 from
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, the other fact about Bihar
also is 86% of the house holds in Bihar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the poorest states,
86% of the house holds in Bihar have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to a cell phone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we use these opportunities
to complete the whole picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that our productivity effort also
really, really realize in their value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers, even if the government effort
may be very little in these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is a farmer's priority,
they put in so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to you about the goat
project that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a goat project in Bihar where a
very, very large number of women farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: who are growing goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program with them where we do
the whole value chain development,
[SPEAKER_00]: animal health, and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fascinating to see these women
on their own, absolutely zero credit to
[SPEAKER_00]: our foundation or our investment or
anything, because we were focusing mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: on the animal health aspect and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely on their own, they started
taking pictures of their goat with their
[SPEAKER_00]: little cell phones and uploaded it on the
eBay-like Indian site, which is OLX,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an eBay-like Indian site,
and sold their goat as far as about 700,
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 kilometers away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the women who sold their goat there,
the price that they got for their goats
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it far from that eBay site was
higher, anywhere between 20% to 37%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at constraint, but looking at
some of these opportunities and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very interestingly, I was doing a
seminar at Oxford University and must have
[SPEAKER_00]: said something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody challenged, but how can you
say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many states in India
where electricity is such a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you think that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I frankly didn't have an answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went back and spoke to our field
people and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a place like Orissa,
there are rural entrepreneurs who have now
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is on a bicycle, they have a
solar panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The young fellow goes to a village and is
in the village for four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets their cell phone charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: He charges some $0.60 or something per
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to another village.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he comes back to this village
every two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every two days, you can get your cell
phone charged fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon, for example, there was this thing
about, can we sell seeds through Amazon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people thought, oh my god,
how naive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who's going to buy seeds through
Amazon?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rural entrepreneurs in places
like Jharkhand and other states,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is happening in Africa as well,
where they go to a village with their
[SPEAKER_00]: little laptops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people gather around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They order things online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a plastic bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be whatever, children's clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These entrepreneurs order it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after 10 days, whenever they come
back, they bring their things with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a huge rural market opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not limit itself from whether you
have internet connectivity or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have a computer at home
to be able to order through Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to have electricity to be
able to charge your cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are endless possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think looking beyond just the
productivity and production lends to
[SPEAKER_00]: technology development, looking at some of
these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I just wanted to,
you know, breeding for profitability and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just productivity, I think,
is an important aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I put these three points down
this morning is because I'm cognizant of
[SPEAKER_00]: the international audience I'm speaking
to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we at the foundation were revisiting
our India investments strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the questions that we constantly
asked ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brantly, my colleague, is here from
the foundation also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept brainstorming on this and said,
what is it that a small foundation like us
[SPEAKER_00]: do in a large system like India,
which invests $22 billion?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that we can do that the country
is already not doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we came up with some of
these things as to what are those value
[SPEAKER_00]: adds that we can bring in and where should
we focus?
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeding for profitability would be one
idea I wanted to bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding for mixed farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have an example of that and what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we breed for a crop, keeping the
mixed farming system in mind, where we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that 60% of the farm animals are fed
with crop residue and not by feed that is
[SPEAKER_00]: bought from a shop, breeding for dual
purpose, which is increasing the food
[SPEAKER_00]: value of it also, but also looking at the
feed value because the feed of the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: is equally important to that crop farmer
as it is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, looking at it from a mixed
farming lens rather than just a crop lens
[SPEAKER_00]: or a livestock lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last point there was on nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nutrition in both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the existing rice wheat system around
the world, how do we sort of fortify that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we make that more nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that it is not really
contributing to people's nutrition lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we augment and value add there is
one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing is also about
diversification, something simple like an
[SPEAKER_00]: early harvest late sowing rice variety,
for example, where a farmer gets one whole
[SPEAKER_00]: full season in between to be able to grow
legumes, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutrition from many, many angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping all this in mind, the
foundation has been investing in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2007, and we've had a large number
of investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, interestingly, like any other
investments, were very production
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity oriented investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've learned a lot from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, we decided to completely change
and revamp our agriculture investment
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy in India to respond to and to
leverage on the government spending and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than looking at it from a
science or from a productivity only lens,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that whatever efforts we make in
India should be able to contribute towards
[SPEAKER_00]: three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Income and not just productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity as a means to achieve that
income, but productivity not as the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so farmer's income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrition, especially what we call it as
food system, where agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition comes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a large program here with
Cornell University as well on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, keeping the women farmers
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, given the large geography,
we decided to focus on a few things and
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from that and take it to other
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end, I wanted to say it would be
good to take a holistic view and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it from an R&D perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: R&D to do what is the question that we
should be asking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could perhaps ride the elephant
together in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
