[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all try to eat to maintain a healthy
and diverse diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not always easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the nutrient deficiencies are
less common in developed nations,
[SPEAKER_00]: surprisingly high proportions of the US
population still do not obtain the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: amount recommended for several nutrients,
including vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if I tell you that we could help
with that by increasing the nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of sweet corn, which I bet many of
you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my project is trying to understand the
mechanism of vitamin accumulation in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to convert the locally-adapt sweet corn
lines into dark yellow grain with high
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-vitamin A and vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carotenoids are compounds produced by
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are pro-vitamin A,
while tocochrominoids are vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several compounds within each
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from now on, I'm going to be using the
colors orange and green to distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As antioxidants, they might decrease the
risk of several health complications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including cardiovascular disease,
age-related macular degeneration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can cause blindness, and specific
cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A study showed that about 26% to 41% of US
population has low levels of vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be associated with increased
risk of cardiovascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, age-related macular degeneration
affects about 25% of people 65 years old
[SPEAKER_00]: and older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Northeast is the region with the
highest proportion of people over that
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this demonstrates the importance of
studies to increase the vitamin in the
[SPEAKER_00]: food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sweet corn, because it's widely
consumed, this could be a good candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: for biofortification, which is the
increasing nutritional quality of food
[SPEAKER_00]: crops by breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet corn is the third-mostly consumed
vegetable in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is estimated that each person eats
about 11 kilograms of sweet corn a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York is one of the most important
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is among the top five states in
production and value of fresh sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it is the second state with the
highest number of fresh market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great opportunity for
address common dietary deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosynthetic pathways for these compounds
are well-characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, the main ideas to remember are
the alpha and beta-carotene, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-crypto-xanthine, are pro-vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lutein and Z-xanthine are associated with
reduced risk of age-related macular
[SPEAKER_00]: degeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alpha-tocopherol has the highest
vitamin E activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the enzymes denoted by the stars
were previously reported to be associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with increase of some of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this information could be used to
improve sweet corn as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you consider, when you look
at the genetic distance of sweet corn to
[SPEAKER_00]: the field of field corn, you can see that
sweet corn is a distant breeding pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has also less variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the nutrient analysis of sweet corn
needs to be done during the fresh stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when sweet corn is eaten as a
vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main question here is, are the
genes responsible for increasing vitamins
[SPEAKER_00]: the same at both stages?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are the favorite alleles found in
field corn also present in our panel?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal for my project is to
understand the mechanism of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional quality of the nutritional
traits in fresh sweet corn kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to achieve that, we're trying to
identify cognitive genes and favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles and develop and validate
marker-based prediction models.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to assess the natural variation
for these compounds, we used a panel with
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 inbred lines from public breeding
programs across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a panel with 400 inbred lines from
public breeding programs across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted it two years, and then we
harvest at eating stage, which is about 21
[SPEAKER_00]: days after pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the years were then fresh frozen,
shelled, and they were later ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: kept in a minus 80 freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carotenoids and tocochrominoids
were measured using HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using these phenotypes together with
genotypes from GBS, we performed a
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for alpha tocopherol,
which is the compound with greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin E activity, we found a significant
association with markers in chromosome 5,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is close to this gene, VTE4,
which encodes an enzyme located at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pathway, right before the compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this candidate gene was previously
reported in field corn as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for delta to gamma tocochrominoid,
we also got a significant hit in
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these markers are close to VTE1,
which, as you can see here, it encodes
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in both branches that goes to the
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When looking at genetic correlation
between the compounds, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are highly correlated,
which is shown by the darker orange in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use this extra information
provided by the cross-trait correlation in
[SPEAKER_00]: a multivariate GWAS in order to increase
the power to identify associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a joint analysis would be more
consistent with the biology when a single
[SPEAKER_00]: variant is associated with multiple
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the same analysis by using
multivariate GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of using the ratio of the two
compounds, we are using both together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after controlling for kernel
type, we still get the VTE1, the same heat
[SPEAKER_00]: that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have a new association with
this gene that is encoded an enzyme like
[SPEAKER_00]: from the precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was not previously reported for
tocochrominoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also makes sense because if you
think by having a favorite allele here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can increase the substrate for the
downstream compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, we identified genes,
candidate genes, three candidate genes as
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned, and being this one a new
association, these are all for
[SPEAKER_00]: tocochrominoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also found one association for
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just would like to mention that
carotenoids, we only have one year of data
[SPEAKER_00]: so far, while tocochrominoids,
we have the two years already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we now expect to identify the
best variants within those regions and use
[SPEAKER_00]: that to select the best performing lines
to be used as a pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used genomic prediction using
genome-wide markers to calculate breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: values for each of those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a rich regression blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by doing five-fold
cross-validation, we got accuracies as
[SPEAKER_00]: high as 0.61 for this compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or provitamin A had accuracy of 0.4 and
vitamin E 0.35 for this compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the lines with the highest
breeding values for complementary traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose traits with high vitamin E and
high provitamin A, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we crossed them last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds generated from that,
we are going to be planting this coming
[SPEAKER_00]: season to start validating the models and
to start the breeding population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, we found different hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of the compounds, being this one
a new association, we already started
[SPEAKER_00]: making the crosses last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the first step to start
increasing the vitamins in sweet corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: going from white with low vitamin A,
for example, and to dark yellow lines with
[SPEAKER_00]: more provitamin A and hopefully,
vitamin E as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank everybody that
helped with my project, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gore lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be happy to answer any
questions you may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different colors of sweet
corn available already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a sense for how popular white
corn is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a sense of what culture we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a right answer for that
because it's pretty subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I understand is that if you start
telling people that that's going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them better, it's better because it has
more vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in theory, it shouldn't change
anything else, like the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to still make good lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they would be willing to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though if they prefer white sweet
corn, I believe they would change if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: better for their health.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of the variance is controlled by
the VTE-1 and VTE-4?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those huge things that are turning
you directly from white to yellow,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that very small relative to the
other small ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, for field corn,
it was found like it was a really high
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we didn't find as high as the,
so I don't think we have as many variation
[SPEAKER_00]: as the field corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still like we have really big
hits for those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are still controlling most of the
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was wondering about how much of
your variation would be in your vitamin E
[SPEAKER_01]: or A controlled by the VTE-1?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you said color variance.
I probably did say that.
Yeah.
So those are colorless.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, no more questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next presenter will be Richard.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
