[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that overly
generous introduction, Margaret.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to say, I'm super excited to
talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say thank you, first of all,
to Lou and Kelly for organizing my
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule and making the arrangements and
everybody else who puts on these seminars
[SPEAKER_04]: and makes it possible to share ideas with
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, as I was saying, am very excited
about this talk because I feel like hunger
[SPEAKER_04]: in Africa, malnutrition in parts of Africa
and the rest of the world really is one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the most pressing issues of our day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes it important, but what
makes it more exciting is that I believe
[SPEAKER_04]: we can now solve these problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at the UN development goals,
number two is ending hunger basically by
[SPEAKER_04]: 2030.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could do it using maybe not just
exactly the kind of things I'm talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about today, but many of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a shame that there's not more
money being put into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The battle is not won by a long shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for anybody contemplating a career
in plant breeding, I'm not saying that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot to be done still.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have some good notions about how
to end hunger in parts of the world that
[SPEAKER_04]: really can't produce enough food at
present time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's dive in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, I want to acknowledge my
co-authors, Isifu Kapran and Irene Mugi,
[SPEAKER_04]: who you see there on the slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Irene Mugi is senior program officer with
Seed Systems Group, where I live in
[SPEAKER_04]: Nairobi, Kenya.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dr. Isifu Kapran is a sorghum breeder,
and he leads our program in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a regional office in Lom√©.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first slide, start with some data.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always good to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, this will be the least
scientific seminar given probably this
[SPEAKER_04]: decade here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bear with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did want to show some trends that I
think are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these show the correlation between the
supply of improved seeds, specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: maize seed, in Uganda and Kenya over a
period of about 15 years, and then looked
[SPEAKER_04]: at what happened with maize yields in
those countries over the same amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you can see that the
correlation is not perfect, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anytime you can get data at a national
level in Africa, which show a trend,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're in a pretty fortunate situation,
because data collection really isn't that
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it shows up on FAO data sites,
you feel like you've done something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I always use this slide when I'm
talking to agricultural ministers and
[SPEAKER_04]: leaders in other countries that we work in
now, because it for me was a real point in
[SPEAKER_04]: time when I learned that here in the
United States, for a long time,
[SPEAKER_04]: we struggled with maize yields as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you convert these yields, I think this
data is gathered by Purdue University,
[SPEAKER_04]: from 1886, right up until the mid 1930s,
our maize yields were stuck at about 1.5
[SPEAKER_04]: metric tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 1.5 metric tons per hectare is a
pretty good average yield for maize across
[SPEAKER_04]: the continent of Africa, wouldn't you say
Ed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happened here in the US was
the introduction of hybrid maize,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, originally double cross
hybrids, and then single crosses,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then everything else that has come on
since.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like we never had this
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't like we weren't trying to
solve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had developed the land grant
universities.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were breeding OPV maize during this
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were names to those varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had developed the extension
service.
[SPEAKER_04]: And still, we couldn't make yields budge
until the advent of hybrid maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why focus on seed systems?
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we feel like we have proof of
concept now on the development of seed
[SPEAKER_04]: system, which is really what this talk is
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the sub talk of the talk is
the 10 things I wish I knew before I
[SPEAKER_04]: became a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll go through those, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you find those useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we did at the end of a 15 years
of work at AGRA was to measure rice and
[SPEAKER_04]: maize yields in 10 countries where we had
worked and where we could vouch for the
[SPEAKER_04]: attribution issues if anybody wanted to
call us on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then compared those with 10 similar
countries where we had never worked on
[SPEAKER_04]: seed systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the big difference in
trends in yields of those crops over that
[SPEAKER_04]: period with up to at least 20,
20, those countries we had assisted
[SPEAKER_04]: advancing quite quickly and in the rest of
Africa, not much happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in one of these countries in
the orange line there, life is not good as
[SPEAKER_04]: a farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, population is growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Africa's population is still growing at a
steady clip.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the countries where we work,
it's about 2.8 up to 3 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some countries like Niger are over 5
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, this is dwindling resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is subsistence agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Subsistence agriculture is not
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an urgent problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at other authors,
just to cite another publication that
[SPEAKER_04]: looks at yields on a big scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, again, if you're in my
field, you look for small positive signs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a very nice positive upward
trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: That had not happened for a long time in
many of the countries where we worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, again, addressing those people who may
be interested in a career in plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding or international plant breeding
and in international development in
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say reviewing what it took to be
in a position to put money toward this
[SPEAKER_04]: work and do it in a practical way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come to my first lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesson number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: International agriculture development is a
fairly top heavy field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's being a bit, you know,
politically correct, I think, if you read
[SPEAKER_04]: me correct or well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And farmers are often the last to benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a whole lot of money spent by
rich countries on development and the big
[SPEAKER_04]: development absorbs a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you might expect that since the
biggest problem that we're working on is
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer productivity at the basic level,
that most of the money would be going
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm using this graphic and I don't
have any data for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope, you know, and this is author's
rant, not for citation, as you see at the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the amount of money that
gets spent on administration and
[SPEAKER_04]: conferences and then big rural development
projects that honestly, I don't know where
[SPEAKER_04]: the money goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know where the ag research money
goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be frank, I think we're still top
heavy in terms of expenditure on research
[SPEAKER_04]: versus expenditure on delivery at the
farmer level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it is a lot of donors and
some governments don't really think that's
[SPEAKER_04]: an interesting problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: We happen to believe it's an interesting
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The breeding work I'll talk about a lot
today, that money has done some good,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're still fighting for enough
resources down at that bottom end of that
[SPEAKER_04]: funnel, which is where farmers actually
get to benefit from what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just mentioned a lot of the breeding
initiatives that I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the donors have to be recognized for
African governments as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: CIMIT has done a great job with stress
tolerant maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you may be aware of that work.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of rice varieties
available now from Africa rice and eerie.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the National Ag Research
Institutes also have a number of good
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are willing to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's exciting work that's been done
in breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have one breakthrough that we
can really use to deliver benefits to
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But very few of those varieties have
reached the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: There seems to be a cycle wherein money
gets poured into research.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can spend their whole career.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of a cautionary tale for
anybody I think studying plant breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: today is that you need to be careful
because you could get into a career in
[SPEAKER_04]: research thinking that you're going to be
able to help farmers and you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: caught in that cycle of research and never
get involved with actually helping
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you wouldn't want to have that happen
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lesson number two, it's a hungry world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably more convicted of this
because we work in what we call the left
[SPEAKER_04]: behind countries, but I can tell you,
I can assure you that there are millions
[SPEAKER_04]: and tens of millions and hundreds of
millions of people yet in Africa that have
[SPEAKER_04]: never had the opportunity to grow a new
variety or are suffering from the effects
[SPEAKER_04]: of never having been able to grow and
improve variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, with population growth and
reducing farm size, that's becoming a
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger problem every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a matter of virgins for more
people to become plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've chosen this field,
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really feel like there's so much you can
do to make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to cite a few examples, what we've
seen in terms of breakthroughs over the
[SPEAKER_04]: past couple of decades, we have reliable
resistance to RYMB and bacterial blight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see Susan McCrouch in the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't go any further because I'll
embarrass myself, but we have really great
[SPEAKER_04]: rice variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just talking to some graduate
students and one of them comes from a
[SPEAKER_04]: highland region of India.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one comes from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm asking, do you have any highland,
coal tolerant rice varieties that we could
[SPEAKER_04]: introduce into Madagascar?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we still need more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Resistance to May's streak virus,
big break through in breeding of May's
[SPEAKER_04]: turcicum leaf blight.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were diseases that killed May's in
many countries, made it virtually
[SPEAKER_04]: impossible to grow May's productively in
Uganda, for example, and large parts of
[SPEAKER_04]: Kenya until people I know and work with,
and even little old me got busy and bred a
[SPEAKER_04]: new generation of hybrids resistant to
foliar diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in Northern Togo last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there last week and I'm afraid there
may be a new strain of May's streak virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, as Borlaug always said,
the wolf is always at the door with these
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases and we need to keep working on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's been great resistance to
anthracnose, grain molds, big problem in
[SPEAKER_04]: sorghum, head bug resistance as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cercospora leaf sprout and rosette virus
disease in groundnut, a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resistant varieties now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't reached farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: ACMV, African cassava mosaic virus,
huge problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brown streak virus as well that broke out
about 20 years ago in Northern Mozambique
[SPEAKER_04]: and caused famine conditions in parts of
Mozambique.
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have resistant varieties to those
thanks to some breeders I can mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, beans has been a big success
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: The advancement of foliar disease
resistance, damping off shoot maggot in
[SPEAKER_04]: beans has been a breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And downy mildew resistance and the
development now of hybrid pearl millet is
[SPEAKER_04]: super exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any farmer has gotten hybrid
pearl millet yet, but we're gonna work on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got it in test production plots in
Northern Ghana right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we'll start to get some seed
out starting next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Resistance to striaga in cowpea and other
foliar diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you wanna know what this looks like
on the ground, that's a land race of
[SPEAKER_04]: sorghum from the Sahelian region of Mali
and to the right, an intermediate
[SPEAKER_04]: Guinea-Caudatum hybrid of sorghum.
[SPEAKER_04]: The farmers said, oh, when they saw that,
they said, oh, but you've made a big
[SPEAKER_04]: mistake because we need the stock to feed
our animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, well, just try this stock and see
how the animals like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they loved it because it's actually
much more digestible, lower lignin
[SPEAKER_04]: contents in the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't have to be so high lignin
because it's not as tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a win.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, bean varieties that are
extremely way better than the local
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties, that's a local bean variety in
Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if you're a farmer growing
that and you get a chance to grow this
[SPEAKER_04]: one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, the breeder did their job.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's David O'Kello in the background
standing there proudly surveying his
[SPEAKER_04]: improved ground nut variety here where
this farmer is standing and that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer's variety on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, big, big differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is bean in Southern Sudan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stole this one from Uganda and brought
it across the border.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the local variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any breeder can see the big differences
that are available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesson number three, though, is it's a lot
easier to develop a new variety than it is
[SPEAKER_04]: to get the seed of that variety to scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was once a neophyte in this field
after we had released our first series of
[SPEAKER_04]: maize hybrids in Western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked myself for the first time,
what do we do now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time to get off the read.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gary Tennyson said, he was my boss at
the Rockefeller Foundation, he said,
[SPEAKER_04]: no problem, jump on a plane, we'll go see
the guys at Pioneer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went to Pioneer, you know,
we signed all those non-disclosure forms
[SPEAKER_04]: and we got inside the inner sanctum with
the big shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I made a presentation like this to
them and I said, so I think you guys need
[SPEAKER_04]: to come into big collaboration with the
Rockefeller Foundation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was silence in the room that
became a bit of a distraction until
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody said, well, I think we should
take a bio break.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy met me in the hallway and he
said, Joe, nice presentation, great stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's more to that story than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the answer we got at that
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in about 2001.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the way home, I had an idea which
I'll tell you about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nobody ever tells you when you're a
breeding student that you might have to
[SPEAKER_04]: look for your own funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they tell you though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But did they talk to you about variety
release committees and how political that
[SPEAKER_04]: can get?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they tell you about anything like
white labels, which is under the Plant
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Inspectorate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever think about how to scale up
from breeder to foundation seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: transition that to certified seed growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to train out growers for the
seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you even have a seed company
interested?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always asking Cornell breeders,
so what do you do after you release a new
[SPEAKER_04]: variety?
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, well, we license it to seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from where I come from, and Ed knows
where I'm talking about, it's a legitimate
[SPEAKER_04]: question.
[SPEAKER_04]: There may not be any seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Licensing agreements, field inspections,
again, from Plant Health Inspectorate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has the process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has the process equipment to produce
our clean seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: And who's going to do the branding
packaging and get this out to farmers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the issues that a breeder faces
when you're working in a developing
[SPEAKER_04]: country system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the real thing I came here to say
is on this slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say this to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I say, it only took us 30 years
to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what you have is the public
private producer model for seed systems
[SPEAKER_04]: development, which needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where it doesn't need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we still need to put more resources
behind us, either to increase productivity
[SPEAKER_04]: of a few main crops that are going to save
lives or to diversify seed supply systems
[SPEAKER_04]: so that people can also diversify their
diets.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it starts with public breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shifts very quickly to seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the interaction between seed companies
who are looking for a profit by producing
[SPEAKER_04]: and selling seed to smaller farmers and
the scientists, there's magic there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to explain it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then that all happens in isolation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the farmers don't even know you're
doing any of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the African landscape for
agriculture is endless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we needed a methodology for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed a methodology for raising farmer
awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have one now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the village-based advisor,
which is kind of like a volunteer health
[SPEAKER_04]: worker and smallpox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do demos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do big demos, at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put a lot of money into them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know the farmers will stand
there politely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll say, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get my Coke now?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'll go home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they won't adopt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad because we did that for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: The element of doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an agronomist who planted that
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: My soil is poor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live a long ways from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That variety is not going to work on my
farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because they're not interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because of the doubt and the risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: A small piece of land grown with a tiny
amount of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 50 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 50 grams of a maize street virus
resistant hybrid variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see the quality of maize crop this
woman has been growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's her.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's her maize crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then distribution through these mom
and pop shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small, just a couple meters square of real
estate where farmers can go and get their
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're thinking, this is too daunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be a plant breeder
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I think I'll go into biotech and study,
I don't know, something really esoteric.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in luck because farmers will pull
you through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do make this system work if they
get half of a chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_04]: This woman grew a small pack of maize on
her farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see she's not a young farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's her land raise of maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is in the Southern Highlands of
Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see the size of that here?
[SPEAKER_04]: What you don't see is that it's about 14
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a cement hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a number.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked her after we visited her plot,
I said, well, what are you going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: now?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this seed is not free.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a small pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just a demo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sell a goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sell some chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I thought, well, how is she going
to know the name of the hybrid when she
[SPEAKER_04]: goes to buy it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she took me by the hand and she
led me to her hut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, that's the name of the
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: TZH.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't read.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5538.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it got released.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available now.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was first sent out by Rockefeller
Foundation, the real agenda was to develop
[SPEAKER_04]: biotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a couple of years, I realized the
real revolution in agriculture for the
[SPEAKER_04]: next 20 plus years was not going to be in
biotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not dissing biotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need GMAs yesterday in Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a political question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could see that the revolution was
really here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmer participatory breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you believe that for decades before
this became the state of the art for
[SPEAKER_04]: developing new varieties, breeders weren't
asking farmers their opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what you see here is amazing info from
these brilliant bean farmers in Eastern
[SPEAKER_04]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the bean breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's taking note of everything they
say about the new varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can use gender based selection
methods now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is under a farmer's field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really greatly reduces the
likelihood of missing the target in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of the new varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fifth lesson is, again, nobody told me
that I needed to work on my people skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to become a plant person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am not a natural born manager by any
means.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I saw some incredibly adept people
managers and nurturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I went to Africa, who also
happened to be plant breeders,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I took a note from how they operated
and realized they would never be
[SPEAKER_04]: successful at all if they didn't know how
to work with teams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a universal rule for
plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to become a plant breeder
at any level, you really need to be a good
[SPEAKER_04]: people manager as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go take a course.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I eventually did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll teach you everything you need to
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's some of the teams that we work
with today.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Sierra Leone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Monica Parker, famous potato scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody know her?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Northern Togo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's John McRobert in a field in
Burundi.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my colleague Ysefu in Guinea Bissau
laying out some plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the other team from Southern
Togo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesson number six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extremely important lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say somehow I'm a socialist at
heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I was born.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the way I will die.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was born at the wrong time to be a
practicing socialist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to say almost any breeder,
if you don't want to work with private
[SPEAKER_04]: sector, forget ever achieving anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: At any kind of scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you need seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need you, but you need them just as
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that trip back from the United
States when we got shut down by Pioneer,
[SPEAKER_04]: did I mention the name of the company?
[SPEAKER_04]: They no longer exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Cortana guys are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the DuPont Pioneer marriage was a
rocky one, I think, at that stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably what influenced.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I was steaming there in my plane
seat, I looked out the window and I asked
[SPEAKER_04]: myself, you know, was there anything that
we saw there in Johnston that looked all
[SPEAKER_04]: that complicated?
[SPEAKER_04]: That an African Pioneer entrepreneur
couldn't do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, basically what I saw them doing
was growing crops and putting them in seed
[SPEAKER_04]: and packages and selling them to farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really made all the difference,
because I came back and I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need Pioneer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need African entrepreneurs to create
their own pioneers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ed came on the scene at that point
with just about the same modus operandi
[SPEAKER_04]: and started to train some of these
pioneering seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just there, they're an amazing
innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't imagine what this kind of an
institution.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Green Horizon Seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a seed company with a CEO in Juba,
South Sudan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because unlike MNC multinationals,
these guys will sell any seed farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: The multinationals are just in it for the
hybrid maize and eventually BT Cotton
[SPEAKER_04]: probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now it's just hybrid maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And women tend to be really good at
running these seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see many of them succeeding against
all odds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to name a few, Maslaha Seed
Company in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not shade tree seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are industrial vertically integrated
seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Producing all these different crops of
seed, improved varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony Okalo in Equator Seeds, Northern
Uganda, same story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Felix of Peacock Seeds, he's also a
parliamentarian sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Helps to get seed policies passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's a seedsman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's his seed company producing
hybrid maize seed and a couple other
[SPEAKER_04]: crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Faso Kaba, that's Maimuna Kulibali.
[SPEAKER_04]: She won the Africa Food Prize for her work
as leader of Faso Kaba Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's tired now.
[SPEAKER_04]: She created a seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got it running.
[SPEAKER_04]: She handed it over to her daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's sustainability in this market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, thanks to the generosity
of many people, the Gates Foundation,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Rockefeller Foundation, where I
worked, we went on to create many more
[SPEAKER_04]: than 114 seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are still creating seed companies
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to keep going as fast as we
can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lesson number seven is this thing that
face to face extension still matters with
[SPEAKER_04]: a nod to John Prime, also known as your
new mobile phone app won't get you into
[SPEAKER_04]: heaven anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen so many of these apps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know they're well intended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers need proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a accountability issue here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't be boiled down to a four inch
phone screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where our friend Paul Seward
came through for us, because he was trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to get farmers who had never used
fertilizer to use fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fertilizer is only sold at 50 kg bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, he decided, you know,
I think the problem is the size of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he made one kilo bags of fertilizer
and immediately sold all all the stock
[SPEAKER_04]: that they had.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in Western Kenya, where farm size
is very small and farmers are very poor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was pre introduction of hybrid
made.
[SPEAKER_04]: So farmers were really poor and really
hungry and couldn't afford anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: any kind of technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now go to Western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like it's a true green revolution
scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the idea here is that, as I've already
said, let the farmer try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make them take your word for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them go home and take some of the seed
with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of a few demos, we get
hundreds of thousands of demos.
[SPEAKER_04]: This drives demand for improved seeds so
that the seed companies can stay in
[SPEAKER_04]: business and achieve what they came to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agro dealers really can't say enough of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really fit into one of the
lessons, but I think they're kind of a no
[SPEAKER_04]: brainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't buy your toothpaste from the
toothpaste company and farmers don't get
[SPEAKER_04]: their seed from seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to have distribution at scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked somebody recently,
how many agro dealers do you suppose there
[SPEAKER_04]: are in Kenya?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had been hearing 3000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, no, the latest data show
there's probably around 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000 agro dealers selling seed and other
inputs in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how many there are in Togo?
[SPEAKER_04]: About six.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all in the big cities,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So farmers don't have access to seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're training agro dealers today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that last week, that's why I was in
Togo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're training agro dealers to become
small scale vendors of improved seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, right today, we're doing the
same thing in Bukavu in Eastern Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesson number eight, you know,
the best seed systems are not private
[SPEAKER_04]: sector driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have the best seed system
here in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely believe in the public
involvement, the vitality of the public
[SPEAKER_04]: sector in a seed supply system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means I believe in it for the
whole food system and the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture system.
[SPEAKER_04]: First stop, agriculture and then the whole
food system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because just take the example of,
you know, the narrowing of our diets.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you just leave the decision making up
to the seed companies and the big ones,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially, they're only going to produce
those crops that their shareholders want
[SPEAKER_04]: to see them produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no private seed company ever
going to breed a new variety of Bambara
[SPEAKER_04]: groundnut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really important crop in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just showing a few photos here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in Eritrea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the wheat breeders who've
got, who've done a fantastic job here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a private seed grower in Burundi
producing in collaboration with the public
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder from Isabu.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the first hybrid maize seed
production plot ever in Burundi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that photo was taken just two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a result of the work we've been
doing over the past 25 years or so,
[SPEAKER_04]: there has been a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more than you can see in the
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the ground, we see big changes in
farmer productivity in these countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's quite a number of countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's been exciting,
but we need to turn the page because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's kind of the, you know,
mirror image or cis image of that map now
[SPEAKER_04]: on the other side of Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's composed of 21 countries where
there really are no progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been no progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about 370 million people,
almost half the landmass of Africa and
[SPEAKER_04]: 2.8% annual population growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means it's doubling every,
I think, 20, 23 years or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably around 40 million farm families
don't have access to better technology,
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely high rates of absolute poverty,
and around 38% average child malnutrition,
[SPEAKER_04]: stunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's chronic malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lesson number nine, I had a great
conversation with the graduate students
[SPEAKER_04]: and asked them all, what's your minor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of the best things about
Cornell is they make you take the minor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to take up an issue because
they were, I learned today in the
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion with the students that if you
had a master's degree, you only have to
[SPEAKER_04]: take one minor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why did you guys make me take two
minors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the point is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I benefited from both my minors,
tropical soils and ag econ, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it helps you to be able to reason
better, I think, when you go and meet with
[SPEAKER_04]: leaders who are unconvinced about the
importance of this technology in their
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Read outside your fields is the main
lesson I think I learned here and be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to make this case when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the time did come because in 2019,
Cornell and Seed Systems Group and a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of brilliant guys from a
consultancy called Satguru came together
[SPEAKER_04]: and we fanned out across Africa and we
studied the seed systems in all these
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we put together a business plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it only costs $95 million over five
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody knows any billionaires
roaming around the streets of Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here until Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got a business plan I want to
talk to them about.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some of the outputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our report card, if you will, every
nonprofit has to give their impact or
[SPEAKER_04]: their report card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's ours so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've reached all right around 7,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: These data are a little bit old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're about 750,000 farmers
reached so far in those countries and
[SPEAKER_04]: produced about, well, by the end of this
year, it will be well over 5,000 metric
[SPEAKER_04]: tons of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're also very proud of is the
training.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a lot of training, some of it
degree-based, most of it short courses on
[SPEAKER_04]: everything from breeding to seed
production to running an agri dealer shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just want to show some images of
what this work looks like on the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I'll wrap up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the work in Burundi,
a very important producer of beans,
[SPEAKER_04]: an extremely impoverished country with
farms, very small farm sizes becoming
[SPEAKER_04]: hungrier by the day, average child
malnutrition over 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the highest in the world and
it's a green country.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason they can't double the
yields of all those crops and malnutrition
[SPEAKER_04]: in Burundi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Djibouti, strange country,
[SPEAKER_04]: very arid, no rain fed agriculture,
but they do grow forages and a bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetables and we're in there thanks to
some funding from Isha.
[SPEAKER_04]: DR Congo, very exciting country to work
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in on hybrid maize seed production
and bio-fortified bean seed production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eritrea weeds the big crop there at
Teff as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the government had been importing
about three containers per year of hybrid
[SPEAKER_04]: maize seed at great cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, Eritrea is a bit of a hermit
kingdom.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have much forex to go around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they said, you can teach us how to
produce hybrid maize?
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now they're producing hybrid maize
in Eritrea as well and reducing their
[SPEAKER_04]: forex expenditures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Madagascar, can't say enough about how
important the work is there, extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: impoverished country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also 45, 50% child malnutrition about 80%
absolute poverty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to work on all fronts in
Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very hard to raise money for that country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lesson number 10 is probably a little
bit unexpected, but I just wanted to point
[SPEAKER_04]: out as breeders, we have to realize
sometimes the local varieties are better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the case in Somalia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on sorghum there and I
really have serious doubts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna find anything better than the
local variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's true for certain varieties
of lowland non-irrigated rice around
[SPEAKER_04]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the local variety wins and
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do we stop there?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we can also introduce other crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, we continue to work in
Somalia on other fronts.
[SPEAKER_04]: South Sudan already mentioned,
Senegal, Togo, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great idea, that last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I was a little younger,
I would tackle that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get these African governments sharing
varieties is hugely powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't realize that they should be
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, a lot of them come from the CG.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them come from leading NARS.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can mention a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mali has extremely talented breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uganda, there's natural born breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tanzania, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we move around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with those breeders who have good
materials and are willing to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is not always the case with the
CGIO.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you gotta have a plan B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a big scramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we gonna get that new rice
variety for Togo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask, what is something
you worked on that's been really
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating or challenging and also what's
a project that you've done or are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're really excited about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's a couple of great questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say sorghum really kind of beats
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a wonderful crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish it was easier to convince
farmers to take an improved variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's just something about that
exquisite adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's had the time to develop in certain
ecologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can show farmers everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just say, not going there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other question, where I'm most excited
about working right now, I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: Guinea-Bissau.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just one of those classically
forgotten countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it rains in Guinea-Bissau and the
soils are fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And child malnutrition is extremely high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they haven't done any variety testing
since 1995, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can bring in varieties and we can get
them into production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're being funded there by the World Food
Program.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the right term.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just case by case.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work in countries where I'm worried
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I'm standing, whether we're going to
deliver, they are so on it and so in
[SPEAKER_04]: partnership with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work in some countries where they're
like, go, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know why you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just kind of everything in
between.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally speaking, I would say,
if you can communicate well to the people
[SPEAKER_04]: on top, this is the importance of a
participatory society.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a non-participatory society,
sometimes it's only really one guy or a
[SPEAKER_04]: person taking all the decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can't get to them, you're not
going to get far.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're living in a day and age when
nobody gets to go out publicly and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't give my people new seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would not work, even in some
of these totalitarian governments or
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what makes it the right
time, I think, to get in and actually do
[SPEAKER_04]: this work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's messy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It often passes through agri-dealers or
the village-based advisors to the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's nobody in charge of that
communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about 30 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have somebody who's in charge of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you need is a volume of
transactions, enough people involved in
[SPEAKER_04]: the transactions so that at least one of
them is going to say, hey, your variety
[SPEAKER_04]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the seed company hears or the breeders
hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the way I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we try to work at scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you don't have a certain scale,
then that critical communication just gets
[SPEAKER_04]: stifled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what I can tell you is what they are
not is probably easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not leader farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we run into that kind of language
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a leader farmer tends to be the guy
with a car.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's up there in the church, tends to be
male, and just kind of the big guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's absolutely death for promoting
new kind of controversial technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because nobody listens to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've always had all the advantages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they associate you and your technology
with the elite sector of society.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go to a lot of pains, along with
Paul Seward's team, the farm input
[SPEAKER_04]: promotions group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I have to give a major shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not our intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_04]: They invented that lock, stock,
and barrel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have a nondisclosure agreement
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're obliged to work in partnership
with FIPS.
[SPEAKER_04]: FIPS is like literally a sister
organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they figured out that model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who the BBA is is someone who loves
agriculture and is a good communicator.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could sum it down to two
characteristics that we're looking for is
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody who really loves agriculture and
would care enough to go around and talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One question online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't directly answer this,
but how many people are employed by?
[SPEAKER_04]: Full-time staff in our two offices,
about 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we work through local national
coordinators quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can not double the number,
but at least add another 15 or so people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do the day-to-day management of
our work on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're part-time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them are breeders working for
the NARS, who get an agreement from their
[SPEAKER_03]: institute to work with seed systems group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're on our business.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to become big.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fighting to stay small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Susan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, you know, it's it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have an obligation to train the
people who are doing the work,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so that they understand what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We often neglect to invite important
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably, you know, partly my
fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: But.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do that in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to bring all of our
practitioners together in in Nairobi in
[SPEAKER_03]: November and have one of those kind of
sessions where we actually have a few
[SPEAKER_03]: important people in the room and they can
talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about a community of
practitioners kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's the other objective of
the November meeting is Eritrean are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be talking to Togo Leaves and they're
at the same stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll learn way more from each other
than they will from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
