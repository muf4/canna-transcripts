[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thanks to Dr. Rakow and his
wife for hosting us while we're here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Cornell for having me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was here about a year and a half
ago and it's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna speak a little quickly just
because I know I have about 40 minutes and
[SPEAKER_00]: when I get to about 30 minutes I'll go
even faster than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know when I get close to that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a pediatrician normally I practice
five days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually traveling the world for one
year on a research year with my wife Bella
[SPEAKER_00]: and my child Kai who are sitting in the
front row over here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've made the title of this talk a bit
broader than I usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of you know that the ties you know
the ties between nature and human health
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of reconnecting us back with
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've lived in natural settings for
thousands of years and evolved in natural
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only really been in very recent
history that we are now spending about 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: of our time indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the average, the average American
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: My disclosures I think Dawn already made
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Rakow did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the medical director for Parker X
America and there's no other commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliations as of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning objectives are pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about epidemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to talk about the epidemic in
the context of climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural resources and this continuing
trend towards urbanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to dive in as fast as I can to
the scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than 500 published studies,
scientific studies that have looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: connection between nature and human
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then very quickly just give you a
little glimpse as to what kinds of things
[SPEAKER_00]: are happening in the world of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we take this science and
actually put it to some sort of applied
[SPEAKER_00]: daily routines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear about climate change all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
this but just a couple of graphics to
[SPEAKER_00]: remind us about the sort of doom that we
hear about on a daily basis, not just here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US but around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural resources are a very important
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working in this field,
this area for about 10 years now and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: even heard people say let's not use the
word natural to phrase natural resources
[SPEAKER_00]: because nature is more than just a
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, just to remind us
that those of us who live in high income
[SPEAKER_00]: countries are using many more times the
resources than those who are living in low
[SPEAKER_00]: income countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the most important context that I
can part with you today is this issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerating urbanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture that you see all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got back from traveling in Lima,
in Bogota and if anybody's been to these
[SPEAKER_00]: capital cities of Latin America,
you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just incredible density, oftentimes very
little nature, huge vast slums and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: often how many of the world's population
is living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to compound that, we're moving as a
species, we're moving into urban areas at
[SPEAKER_00]: a really high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 2050, two thirds of the world's
population will be living in cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, this means that we need to rethink
how we live in cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in our cities?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that affect our health?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I wanted to point out was even
the United Nations, one of its sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: goals, number 11 to be specific,
mentions the importance of creating green
[SPEAKER_00]: public space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green public space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see that very often,
like in literature, I don't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly in the medical literature very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even see it that often in the
public health world, which I also come
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's increasingly important,
as you can tell, as we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerating urbanization, to think about
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're going to be living,
that's where we're moving to, and how can
[SPEAKER_00]: we incorporate a little more greenness
perhaps into our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually looking at the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a look at chronic disease in the
US, according to the Centers for Disease
[SPEAKER_00]: Control and Prevention, just to give you
some scope of what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I see on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm a pediatrician, and even
though I thought that I was going into a
[SPEAKER_00]: career where I would deal with a lot of
runny noses and strep throats and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, what I'm dealing mostly with is
that stuff, but in the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-diabetes, diabetes, high blood
pressure, certainly lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity, and a ton of mental health
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give vaccines and all that stuff that we
do as primary care pediatricians,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do it in the context of a lot of
chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kids, we were taught to say that kids
aren't little adults, but to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, kids are looking more and more
like their adult peers, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that you usually think of in the
adult world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an epidemic of nature
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is very hard to read for a
reason because this is the amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: four to seven minutes, is the average
amount of time a child spends in
[SPEAKER_00]: unstructured play outside every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the amount of time, seven hours,
that they spend average amount of time on
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of electronic device or some
kind of screen time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, it may be doing homework,
it's not always playing video games,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is a good way to see what's
happening in terms of the way we spend our
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't point out, which I don't
think I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in four to seven year olds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can only imagine what happens as
they grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually intensifies, and it establishes
a routine, a pattern that they use for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is true with other behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that smoking, if you start smoking
before the age of 18, you're much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more likely to smoke for the rest of
your life than starting initiation of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking after the age of 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the top 10 causes of death also
that are, I put up here in part because
[SPEAKER_00]: every one of these is either directly or
indirectly related to this, our lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit exaggerated here,
but we sit a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always eat the right kinds of
food in the right kinds of ways in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of stress, and then when you
have all these three things, you develop
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these three things, and then you
come to me and you ask for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's generally my life, what I see on my
end of things, which is really true for
[SPEAKER_00]: most of us who are in the practicing
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, enough doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the nature pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a food pyramid,
which you may or may not remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I don't like very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we use the plate and we portion it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really do like the nature
pyramid because it gives you a good idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is from I believe the University
of North Carolina, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, what I wanna point out is on
the very bottom of the pyramid is low
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency, high frequency, low intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things like the gardens,
the rooftops, campus here, you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of greenery here, things that you might
actually see every day, maybe even every
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you move toward the top of the
pyramid, it's much more intense and less
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just went to hike on the Inca Trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may never do that again in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very low frequency, high
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was amazing, I saw the Urubamba
River, I saw orchids just peering over,
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of feet drop, amazing things I
saw, which is great, wonderful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not what we're going to do every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm focusing my career and my time down
here, I happen to call it the foundational
[SPEAKER_00]: work, because it is the foundation of the
pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really important, especially as
we move into cities, and more so we live
[SPEAKER_00]: in cities, we move into cities,
because this is what most people are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to, not traveling to even a
state park, which many of my patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at a community health center,
so I see primarily low income patients in
[SPEAKER_00]: DC, Columbia Heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even they rarely get to Rock Creek,
which is just a minor mile away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they even more rarely get to Blue
Ridge Mountains, for example, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and a half drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having city parks, having urban areas,
having gardens, having green around you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is even more important for these
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onto the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everybody here may know what a
systematic review is, I think the majority
[SPEAKER_00]: probably do, but it's important to have
inclusion criteria, often a meta-analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: is part of a systematic review,
and it's a quick way for us to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of data and different numbers of
studies that might actually give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into certain questions that need
to be asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the questions are, what happens when we
spend time outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go through a series of studies,
and you'll see some of the similarities as
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One certainly is, there's a marker for
stress, biomarker cortisol, stress
[SPEAKER_00]: cortisol, there's a decrease in that,
decrease in heart rate, these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased, in blood pressure, cholesterol,
I wanna read all of these, you can read
[SPEAKER_00]: them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart rate variability is important,
and that is our ability to go up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: back down again, and how quickly you get
back down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want actually a high heart rate
variability, not a low heart rate
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a med student and doing OB,
we talked about that with the fetal rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually it's now used oftentimes to
talk about the effect of nature on human
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another systematic review focused on 133
controlled studies, and the intervention
[SPEAKER_00]: itself was these adventure-based
activities, short-term walking,
[SPEAKER_00]: seated relaxation in natural environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do they find?
[SPEAKER_00]: They found this is more of the mental
health piece, but psychological
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being, psychosocial function,
psychological stress response,
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive performance, all these things
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's a little
difficult in this literature is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I mentioned there are over 500
studies that are published, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: seemingly quite different in their
methodology and study design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes doing a systematic review
kinda hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes coming with these grand
conclusions a little bit hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna point that out,
that this is, we're still learning a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about nature and human health,
we're learning about the mechanisms as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another study here done in 2018,
I tried to find the most recent group of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that has come out, and you see a
decrease in mortality, heart rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the earliest studies done by Min
Kuo in University of Illinois were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looking at a low-income housing
that was built, initially had greenery
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit, over the years wasn't
maintained in some areas, was maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found was, not to her
surprise really, because she worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: animals before, caged animals and animals
living in natural environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that the animals who lived in more
natural environments, they lived longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had better social interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same she found was true for
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where humans lived in this low-income
housing that had some greenery,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had less violence, they had better
social interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not surprising that you would live
longer if you lived closer to and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore had more access to green space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's been found,
which maybe is intuitive to many people,
[SPEAKER_00]: is an increase in physical activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't necessarily intuitive to me
initially, but when I think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm outside and when you're outside,
you are much more likely to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you picnic outside, you're more
likely to get up and walk around,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw the frisbee, maybe investigate
something, you're more likely to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, actually, when you're outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's interesting things that we've
been able to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attention and mood, I'll get to in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been some research looking at
ADHD, and I'll mention that in Dr. Kuo's
[SPEAKER_00]: work just a little bit later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest therapy, I wanted to share with you
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you mentioned already,
but I'll be doing a walk, and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: for Dr. Rakow's class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna be a two and a half hour
forest therapy walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, being out in this
forested area or being out in nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one study did look at that,
a relatively small sample size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they did find some positive impacts of
lowering and high blood pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: some cardiac and pulmonary function
improvement, and you can see the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is strong evidence that greenness is
associated with even more things,
[SPEAKER_00]: so improvements in birth weight,
dimension physical activity, and this has
[SPEAKER_00]: led even some researchers to talk about
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably should be thinking about,
once again, how to design, how to change
[SPEAKER_00]: cities, how to design cities, urban areas,
so that people, all people, have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna run over here, I'm running out
of time, so I'm gonna go a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I just wanna make sure we get,
there's a lot of science in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think for the purpose of this
lecture, a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some individual studies that I
found fascinating, wanted to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty recent study done in
2018, and it was done in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two different areas where they
tracked children through many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did was they had two areas,
one area had a, and they looked sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: geospatially to see how green and not
green these two areas were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one area not very green, one area quite
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my surprise, they actually did
functional MRIs, and they measured the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in brain mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was the kids who grew
up in areas where it was much greener
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had larger brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That correlated with better working memory
and reduced inattentiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are studies looking at children and
their school settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether a forest school versus a
non-forest school, and what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: In cortisol, I mentioned cortisol is a
stress hormone, so we know that forest
[SPEAKER_00]: school students have a steady decline in
cortisol, and we know it's constant
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that the profile of these
students in the indoor class are similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to individuals prone to stress associated
mental disorders like depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is already some evidence looking
and evaluating the outcomes in these kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of educational settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study that I actually did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't many studies yet looking at
the park prescription, meaning a educator,
[SPEAKER_00]: a health professional would actually write
a prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, that's happening,
has been happening for, is it two years
[SPEAKER_00]: now or more?
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, two years at Cornell Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Rakow will talk about that in just
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the idea of actually writing a
prescription for a patient or a client to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend time in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk more about the way that I do
it and that my nonprofit actually promotes
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in 2013, and what we found
was something very important to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was, this was a sort of before and
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pre and post intervention intervention
was the park prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that children are
definitely more likely to visit a park and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually increase their level of physical
activity by virtue of the prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another study done by another
pediatrician, a colleague of mine at UCSF,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Razani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did was a randomized trial,
and she had two groups of kids and
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: One received the very plain park
prescription, which I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one group received the park
prescription, plus all the bells and
[SPEAKER_00]: whistles, which means they got
transportation provided for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Saturdays, they went to a local park.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a naturalist with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a photographer with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had food with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a production, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do this every Saturday,
and it's called SHINE.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acronym for the organization that
she's founded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she looked at was stress
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to her surprise, the group that got
just the plain park prescription with no
[SPEAKER_00]: bells and whistles did just as well in
stress reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good for all of us, really,
not just good for me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was reassured that you don't have to
have all those resources necessarily to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some value out of this park
prescription, that there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My own hypothesis is that there's
something special in that relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between a client patient and their primary
care provider, their psychologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: their educator, some trusted professional
in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has a lot to do with
this, is why it's actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Dr. Kuo Ming Kuo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Taylor, Dr. Kuo, did a study that's
one of these landmark studies about
[SPEAKER_00]: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, two, actually there were more
than two, there were three treatment arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One arm of kids, these are kids who all
have ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: One went to a city park and the other two
went to urban settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found was that the kids who
went to a park and had unstructured play
[SPEAKER_00]: did just as well in their ADHD
symptomology, so the checklist of symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: for ADHD, as kids who've had a dose of
methylphenidate, which is a stimulant,
[SPEAKER_00]: at four hours out, which is the maximal
effect usually on a short acting stimulant
[SPEAKER_00]: medication, as the kids who went on a walk
and just, I'm sorry, played in a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not to say that if anybody in here
has ADHD, you should stop your meds right
[SPEAKER_00]: away and go out to the Botanic Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a little bit of food for thought
to think about could nature actually be a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment option for many kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the answer is, from my own
practice, that it's certainly an adjunct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I have kids who come in with
attention problems, one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: things I do is we talk about diet,
their routine, and certainly play.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, where do they play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they play outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find even in the very,
very low income populations is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't have that kind of unstructured
time, very similar to kids of high income.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned forest bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shinrin-yoku is the Japanese term for
forest bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is another realm of research
done in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Dr. Lee did this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was pretty landmark research looking
at not just at natural killer cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's what's talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And natural killer cells are an important
part of our immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a more ancient part of our immune
system and thought to really protect us
[SPEAKER_00]: against cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they float around our blood and they
look for abnormalities, they look for
[SPEAKER_00]: cells that are reproducing too fast,
hence cells that might be heading towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the cancer and they take care of that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having natural killer cells is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having activity, natural killer cell
activity is a good thing, a better thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that has been established is
that the phytoncides, these essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oils, and I'm not a botanist, I'm not a
horticulturalist, but from what I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, yell out if I'm saying
something completely off the mark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's cypress and pine are two
of the- Pines, oaks, cypress, and a number
[SPEAKER_03]: of other genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so pines, oak, and oak, and cypress,
to give you an example, have these natural
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring chemicals that do seem to
increase our level of natural killer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among other things I mentioned in here
as well, I don't wanna go to these other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical meteors, but I put them in there
if you wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought what was most fascinating with
this is that if you look over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so these are two night, three day
excursions going into a forested area in
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when you take blood
samples and you measure natural killer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, you can see the difference on
before day one, two, seven, and 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that it rises,
it elevates, but it stays elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays elevated 30 days out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you compare that to an urban
setting, you don't see any significant
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the points that they suggested
in this research is frequency,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how often should we go into a forested
area?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often should we do these kinds of
outings?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's suggesting, the team is suggesting
that maybe at least once a month,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is pretty phenomenal that
there's even a frequency and perhaps a
[SPEAKER_00]: dose related to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gone through quite a bit of the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've left you with something
perhaps you haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many places, obviously this
crowd knows where to go to find scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may not have heard of the Children
and Nature Network Research Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't heard of it,
it's a good place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just about children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually spans all ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a nice compilation of the
research that's been done on nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: health in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to PubMed too, but it's a nice,
really easy place to find a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gone through with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean for all my colleagues
around the world, frankly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I heard Rich Louv speak,
when I read his book, Last Child in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Woods, and since then, many other books,
Nature Fix is another one I've read by
[SPEAKER_00]: Florence Williams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a doctor, I'm a plumber, I'm a
technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been a researcher so intensely
involved as many of you have been or will
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what I can do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know where do we apply this,
as do you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I go back to the office,
I want to know how can I put this
[SPEAKER_00]: information into practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you some idea of what I
have done and what others have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four programs that come to
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Track Trails, Walk with a Doc,
Association of Nature and Forest Therapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Parker X America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned forest bathing or
shinrin-yoku, which is an ancient Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really new about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Association of Nature and Forest
Therapy has taken the concept of forest
[SPEAKER_00]: bathing and really gone in a slightly
different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called nature therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is for a guide to really open
the doors, so to speak, to a therapy that
[SPEAKER_00]: is experienced by virtue of being in
nature, to put it simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking a little bit from a scientific
perspective, but I'm also talking from a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal one because I'm right now a
guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a guide in training for the
Association of Nature and Forest Therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went through an eight day course and
I'm in my six month practicum right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually leading a walk,
a two and a half walk, an hour walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, there's a standard set of
principles and values for all of us who
[SPEAKER_00]: are guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over 600 guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to get you a more recent
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: In communication with the two directors,
I think it's closer to a thousand guides
[SPEAKER_00]: right now around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A majority of them are going to be in the
US, Europe, Australia, those countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are in something around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea really is that when you are
taking this science, because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of science now, what do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the role of the guide is to create a
safe place to use a standard sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not random what we do in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start off with something that we
call, we do these things called
[SPEAKER_00]: invitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we invite you to open your senses and
wherever that nature, that place might be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really engage your senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by virtue of doing that, clearly there
are physical outcomes that come from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mental health outcomes that come
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, in my own
personal experience, there's also this
[SPEAKER_00]: relational thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start to form a relationship with
nature, which I think is also probably
[SPEAKER_00]: part of what's happening in terms of our
getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a concept in A and FT,
in Association of Nation and Force
[SPEAKER_00]: Therapy, called medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the medicine that I was
taught necessarily, but medicine for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: we define medicine as not my curing you,
but rather a reciprocal relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm relating to a tree or I'm
relating to a fauna, they're also relating
[SPEAKER_00]: back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a phrase that's often used is the more
than human world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we relate to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little woo woo for some people,
when you first hear about it, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my edges when I first
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've really taken to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of value in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just even being in the Botanic Gardens
today, being walking along the gorges,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to a state park yesterday,
just being here on this campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot that could happen,
I think, here on the campus that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: done through this means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty amazing stuff that happens through
this association.
[SPEAKER_00]: David, I know all the founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of all these organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back, Amos Clifford is the person
who started this.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Sabier is a cardiologist based in
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started an organization that's now
international called Walk with a Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably a little more out in the
popular culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody heard of Walk with a Doc?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple idea, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, walk with a doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get too much simpler than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So David got frustrated many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: His patient is not doing so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a branch of cardiology called
preventive cardiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have a patient who's morbidly
obese and whatever is not working,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes will refer to a preventive
cardiologist to see what can be done on
[SPEAKER_00]: their end as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he suggested on some Saturday,
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how he did this, but he must
have sent out a communication to all his
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be at this park on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to join me, join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going for a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 of his patients showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a thirst.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an appetite for this, much more
than we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to walk with your doctor is pretty
cool, because you usually have to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: their office.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have insurance and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really neat idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often I've been on these walks before
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great walks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually there's a brief presentation
before the walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually done outdoors,
but it can be done indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And questions and the conversation happens
as you walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one I went on was probably about
an hour and a half or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it at the US Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 500 chapters worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here how fast it's growing
from 14 to 18, the number of walks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the walker visits per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have all of their data,
but I encourage you to visit their website
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn more about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is Cornell Health here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a city here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are doctors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a doctor now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really been nurse practitioners or
other types of specialists and health
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners who are doing this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Eurose runs track trails,
Kids in Parks, and also a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very wonderful program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is that this has really
started primarily focused on children,
[SPEAKER_00]: although now I understand it's also
including adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that if we can get people
out to trails, and they initially
[SPEAKER_00]: partnered with pediatrician's offices,
it started in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some funding from the Blue Ridge
Parkway Foundation, National Park Service,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Blue Cross Blue Shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was to connect people with
these trails by virtue of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pediatrician's offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would put up the information about
what can happen, how you can get connected
[SPEAKER_00]: to these trails on the trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're keeping you engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have activities you can do
actually on the trails from biking hiking,
[SPEAKER_00]: geocaching, paddling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember way back they were doing the
disc golf as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's keeping folks engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also sort of this treasure hunt
sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go, and I've gone on these
myself as well, we have several in the DC
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they do is they partner with
parks, park agencies, national parks,
[SPEAKER_00]: state parks, municipal parks, who already
have the trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not building trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're partnering with those agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll put up some of the signage and
allow the activity to happen on those
[SPEAKER_00]: trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're tracking the steps and the
numbers of times these kids are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have fantastic data that this
actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one is my organization,
Parker X America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out in DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called ourselves DC Parker X.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had initially 20 parks around the
health center where I work that were in a
[SPEAKER_00]: platform for us to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have over 7,000 parks in our
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parker X America is really a platform,
meaning that you could take this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing to any place in the world
where you would find some accessible green
[SPEAKER_00]: space, some burden of chronic disease,
and a willingness to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really the three important
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal, our main mission really is
to educate, educate, educate, help
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals, provide them with a tool,
a platform for them to actually prescribe
[SPEAKER_00]: to their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free, so we don't charge anything for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prescription itself is something
that I've struggled with for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, why would I struggle with a
prescription?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I mean by that is the park
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now clearly, if I were to prescribe an
antibiotic or some medication to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say to you, Dr. Rakow,
take any antibiotic you like for as often
[SPEAKER_00]: as you like, whatever dose you like with
or without food, and I'll see you back
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10-day course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's a liquid for child.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: With food, avoid the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give somebody some specific
instructions that makes up the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really ran with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do this for the park
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was finding that all these
incredible programs, these park
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription programs around the country,
were kind of loosey goosey about the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I wanted to do a trial on was,
let's make it specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the park prescription that we do on our
platform is very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to have a park or a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to have an activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the activity could be, you can
imagine, a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be stargazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be forest bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be playing tennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be taking your dog for a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that your patients tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be talking to your dog about
what they want to do, what they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is important, because I want
them to tell me where they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable, where they feel safe,
where is close to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the first two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second two things are the frequency
and the duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know how long they're willing to
commit to this activity, when they do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how many times per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time is almost up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I define the park
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not how the world defines it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like the world to define it this
way, but we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really pushing for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to standardize and
harmonize so we can research and evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: and study and make it clinically effective
for all of us to do it the same way within
[SPEAKER_00]: those parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's electronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I send my patient a text or an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it, and they respond every time
they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I see them at the follow up visit,
I know how many times they filled their
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that about antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that about the park
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I walk in, I have knowledge,
and I'm holding them to that contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 500 prescribers around the
world, mostly in the US right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made a lot of prescriptions,
and we've had a lot filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening, I have found,
is a lot of these 500 plus are doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm encouraging them to do it our way
so it's more clinically relevant to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: to their patients, more effective,
and so I can have the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'm going to pass it on to Dr.
Rakow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Dr. Zahr, for sharing so
much meaningful and really inspiring
[SPEAKER_03]: information with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'd like to do is build from the
remarks that Dr. Zahr shared with us and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about a specific program that we have
here at Cornell called NatureRx at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of you are graduate students,
some of you are undergraduate students,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the first thing I'd like to share is
that college should be a time of learning,
[SPEAKER_03]: for exploration, for developing new
skills, and for fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: College should be fun, but for so many
students, college and university life is
[SPEAKER_03]: filled with mental and physical and
performance-related problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the latest 2018 National
Collegiate Health Assessment just came
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They surveyed nearly 28,000 students on 44
campuses, and here are some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: findings from that large assessment.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the previous 12 months, 20% of students
felt that things were hopeless,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20% of students felt very lonely,
17% of students felt so depressed that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was difficult to function, and 18% felt
overwhelming anxiety or overwhelming
[SPEAKER_03]: anger, and nearly 7% indicated that they
had considered suicide.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are staggering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very disturbing statistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So based on all that Dr. Zahr just shared
with us, we know that there is a body of
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific evidence that clearly indicates
that spending time in nature is beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: to us physically, physiologically,
behaviorally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our challenge is how do we convince
students here at Cornell and at other
[SPEAKER_03]: campuses to actually spend intentional
time out in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I include that word
intentional is that I've done some very
[SPEAKER_03]: unscientific preliminary investigating by
standing on one end of the Tripphammer
[SPEAKER_03]: Bridge and watched students crossing over
that bridge in the morning on their way to
[SPEAKER_03]: class.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 90% of them are looking at their
iPhones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not aware of the fact that this
spectacularly beautiful Beebe Lake and
[SPEAKER_03]: Tripphammer Falls are right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, those are unintentional
experiences in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a number of years ago, several
colleagues and I, David Cutter being one
[SPEAKER_03]: of them, were on a coffee break during
some Cornell conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started to think about the fact
that Cornell has truly one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful campuses in America,
but that we also have one of the highest
[SPEAKER_03]: percentages in our student body of
students suffering from mental health
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought, couldn't there be some way
of better utilizing all of that natural
[SPEAKER_03]: beauty and horticultural beauty as a way
of contributing to the wellbeing of our
[SPEAKER_03]: students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really was the genesis of
NatureRx at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are five components of NatureRx,
and I'd like to speak about each of these
[SPEAKER_03]: individually.
[SPEAKER_03]: A nature prescription program,
a NatureRx website, a NatureRx class that
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Zahr and I are about to go off to,
a nature e-postering, and finally a
[SPEAKER_03]: student NatureRx club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad to see we have some of the
officers of the club here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, the nature prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Dr. Zahr mentioned, this program
started at Cornell Health a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, we were working with a
relatively small number of health
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals at Cornell Health,
but we had convinced these health
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals to hand out a paper
prescription as part of the therapy or
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment recommended for students who
were suffering from depression,
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety, high levels of stress,
obesity, self-cutting, suicidal ideation,
[SPEAKER_03]: any of those complexes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it said, take a walk or run around
Bebe Lake, rest on the slope, enjoy a
[SPEAKER_03]: sunset, and spend 20 minutes two to three
times a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some students actually paid
attention to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think that many students did not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this previous academic year,
we actually were able to integrate the
[SPEAKER_03]: nature prescription into the electronic
health record.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very hard for you to see from
there, but you can see it says NatureRx
[SPEAKER_03]: discussed and recommended.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, in this previous academic year,
over 700 students were recommended time in
[SPEAKER_03]: nature by more than two dozen health
professionals at Cornell Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I move on to that, a new
development that is about to start,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we are particularly excited about,
is that this year, Cornell Health has
[SPEAKER_03]: developed a method to confidentially and
anonymously survey all of the students
[SPEAKER_03]: getting prescribed nature so that we'll be
able to assess things like did they in
[SPEAKER_03]: fact follow the prescription?
[SPEAKER_03]: How frequently are they going out in
nature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they going out in nature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it reducing their stress level?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have an actual body of
information about Cornell students being
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribed nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another component of the program is our
NatureRx website, naturerx.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't look it up right now, listen to me,
but do look it up right after the seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea behind the website is we
wanted students, we do want students,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get over the mindset of, oh yeah,
you know, I've heard nature is good for
[SPEAKER_03]: me, but I don't have an hour to devote for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get to class.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go to lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to write papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So through this website, we profile 15
natural and landscape sites around campus,
[SPEAKER_03]: many of them managed by Cornell Botanic
Gardens, and we provide GPS-based walking
[SPEAKER_03]: directions on how to get from wherever you
are right now to the nearest NatureRx
[SPEAKER_03]: site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, five minutes or less of walking
time to get to that site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have an hour, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take 15 minutes to walk to this site,
spend a little time there, and then walk
[SPEAKER_03]: to your next assignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: A third element is our NatureRx class.
[SPEAKER_03]: We piloted this class last fall and based
on the success of it, we have now made it
[SPEAKER_03]: a regular part of the curriculum PLSCI
1125.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also part of engaged learning where
you live at Cornell, so it's intended to
[SPEAKER_03]: appeal particularly to first-year students
at North Campus and second-year students,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're very grateful that engaged
Cornell is provided.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're providing funding for the class.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have 18 students enrolled in the
course this fall, and as Dr. Zahr just
[SPEAKER_03]: explained, we're about to, or he is about
to take them on a two-hour nature therapy
[SPEAKER_03]: experience and walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the class last year, as part of the
curriculum, I asked the students to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop a relationship with a spot on
campus in which they would feel
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly safe and calm, and I had them
write critical reflections about their
[SPEAKER_03]: special spot, but one week I said,
your assignment for next week is to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop a non-written reflection on your
spot of peace and calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some students did all of that art
pieces that were reflections of their
[SPEAKER_03]: special spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: One student who is a freshman,
so was here for the very first time,
[SPEAKER_03]: had come from South Florida and had never
experienced autumn before, so she played
[SPEAKER_03]: the full component of Vivaldi's Four
Seasons as her way of showing her
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciation for autumn.
[SPEAKER_03]: For experiencing fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: A fourth component of NatureRx at Cornell,
we don't want just the students who are
[SPEAKER_03]: experiencing mental health problems and
going to Cornell Health to know about and
[SPEAKER_03]: take advantage of NatureRx, and just the
students who are enrolled in our NatureRx
[SPEAKER_03]: class.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want all students to be aware of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So working with the communications team at
Cornell Health, we have developed this
[SPEAKER_03]: series of e-posters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have seen them in the foyer of the
Plant Science Building, and they say such
[SPEAKER_03]: things as, did you know that time spent in
nature can improve your exam scores,
[SPEAKER_03]: improve your social life, improve your
sleep patterns, and reduce overall stress
[SPEAKER_03]: levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for each of these, we cite papers that
have verified that benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we have a NatureRx club made up
of both undergraduate students and grad
[SPEAKER_03]: students, and the club is just forming for
this academic year, and they are planning
[SPEAKER_03]: a series of walks in nature, experiences
in nature, presentations by people related
[SPEAKER_03]: to this field, and hopefully that NatureRx
club is going to expand and engage more
[SPEAKER_03]: and more students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I recently co-authored and published
a book with Dr. Gregory Eales,
[SPEAKER_03]: who until recently was the director of our
counseling and psychiatric services
[SPEAKER_03]: division of Cornell Health, and it is
called NatureRx Improving College Student
[SPEAKER_03]: Mental Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that book, we provide an overview
of the kinds of mental health challenges
[SPEAKER_03]: students are facing today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also provide a step-wise process for
developing a NatureRx program on your
[SPEAKER_03]: campus, and we talk about the role of
NatureRx programs in the context of the
[SPEAKER_03]: future of the American university.
[SPEAKER_03]: The final thing I'll mention is that the
NatureRx program here at Cornell is just
[SPEAKER_03]: one of several NatureRx programs on
American campuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our book, we profile the programs at
Cornell, but also at three other campuses,
[SPEAKER_03]: UC Davis, University of Minnesota,
and College of William and Mary.
[SPEAKER_03]: From that core of four colleges and
universities, we have just this year
[SPEAKER_03]: developed a NatureRx program called
NatureRx Campus Network, and the network
[SPEAKER_03]: members are all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and just starting to be in Canada also.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's large universities, small
universities, colleges, geographically
[SPEAKER_03]: diverse, and as the coordinator of the
campus NatureRx network, I send a weekly
[SPEAKER_03]: e-newsletter to the members in which the
best practices at individual campuses are
[SPEAKER_03]: described, opportunities for collaboration
are brought out, recent literature that is
[SPEAKER_03]: pertinent to our field is cited,
and a subgroup of network members are now
[SPEAKER_03]: working on developing a virtual symposium
for campuses for next spring in which
[SPEAKER_03]: we're hoping to involve 100 or more
campuses around North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no doubt that we live in a very
tense and stress-filled world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in a world with unfortunate but
tremendous examples of environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: degradation, but we also live in a world
where there are programs like ParkRx
[SPEAKER_03]: America, like our campus NatureRx
movement, that really gives us hope for
[SPEAKER_03]: the future because they recognize the
human benefits of time in nature and they
[SPEAKER_03]: provide mechanisms for people to spend
that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much on behalf of Dr.
Czar and myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to say that we have time
for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can take maybe two,
and then we actually have to go off to the
[SPEAKER_03]: NatureRx class.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there are a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: David.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you both for fabulous talks and
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I particularly like the father-son
matching shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the easiest ways of getting access
to green spaces and urban environments is
[SPEAKER_01]: to create smallish horticultural gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody looked at the difference
between visiting a small horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: garden versus getting out in a bigger,
major place with big trees, etc.?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can address that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there have been a number of studies
that have looked at the human health
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits of spending time in a botanical
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those studies have not quantified size of
garden and related that to impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one study that looked at four
different botanic gardens in Florida found
[SPEAKER_03]: that the experience of walking through the
garden was particularly impactful for that
[SPEAKER_03]: cohort that had self-identified before the
visit as having very high stress levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that spending time in a botanic
garden can reduce stress and cortisol
[SPEAKER_03]: levels and blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does not, I'm fond of saying it
doesn't have to involve the forest
[SPEAKER_03]: primeval.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Ken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the studies you cited were fairly
structured along a prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about a more natural experiment?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Ithaca has, as you know,
as many opportunities, state parks and
[SPEAKER_02]: gorges.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a large random sample there
are already people not doing it the
[SPEAKER_02]: structured way but hiking, hiking,
hiking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do those people seem healthier than the
group that's more sedentary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so just a quick thank you for the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, you know,
in terms of the studies that I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be, maybe I was, just a quick,
you know, clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of the research is
actually not on the park prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of the research has to
do with the things that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just people being in green space,
living near green space, having access to
[SPEAKER_00]: green space, group outings, things of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the literature is pretty convincing
that being in or near these green areas
[SPEAKER_00]: has a substantial health effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went through a lot of those with all
of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the opposite is true with the
studies that we have a paucity of studies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more clinically focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that note, you know, I'll be
partnering, I am partnering actually now
[SPEAKER_00]: already with RAND Corporation,
Deb Cohen, and we're gonna be doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: randomized trial funded by the NIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five-year trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look at the more
clinical side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be looking at the
accelerometry so whether it's moderate to
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous physical activity as a result of
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be looking at some diabetes
measures, cholesterol, triglycerides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be looking at those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there, as I mentioned earlier,
there's really just a handful of studies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, despite having so few
clinical studies, I'm very convinced with
[SPEAKER_00]: the science that being in nature has
measurable effects and many positive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on human health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would love to have us stay and answer
further questions, but class time beckons
[SPEAKER_03]: for us and probably for many of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for your attention this
afternoon, and we will see you again next
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
you
