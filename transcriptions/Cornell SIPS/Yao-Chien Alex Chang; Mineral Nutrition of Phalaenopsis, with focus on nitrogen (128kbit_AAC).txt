[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy and very excited to be here
back in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because I did my PhD here, and I will
show you my favorite photo in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work with this young guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so and after I returned to Taiwan in
the past 14 years, I have been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: research on orchids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of I work on the physiology study
of orchid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, flowering regulation,
post-harvest, fish culture, and a lot in
[SPEAKER_03]: mineral nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today I want to share with you kind of
the some interesting result, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: with you regarding that in phalaenopsis,
and we focus on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think many of you here should have
known that right now, phalaenopsis is the
[SPEAKER_03]: number one photo crop worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the number one in the United
States, and it's the number one kind of in
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I'm offering you some of the
background information why I conducted
[SPEAKER_03]: those study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you check the literature,
you will find a lot of inconsistent result
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding the phalaenopsis on nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes they are even controversy to
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even they are using the same cultivar,
sometimes they are using the same method,
[SPEAKER_03]: they may yield very, very different
result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the many of the growers, they try to
reduce or terminate the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilization during the forcing period of
phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this a good practice?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have some research on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and then kind of course, as the
researcher, we have to provide some
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendation to the grower because right
now, the phalaenopsis is a very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very important crop worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the story started about 13 years ago,
we conducted an experiment like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had kind of different rate of nitrogen,
different rate of phosphorus and a
[SPEAKER_03]: different rate of potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we kind of do the treatment to the
phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even with kind of nitrogen deficiency
for more than 18 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was one year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: The phalaenopsis can still flower with two
spike.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's similar for the phosphorus
deficiency and the potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of here, I want to know why they
are so good kind of to deal with kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: the nutrient stress, even with such a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought, there is a kind of very,
very strong kind of nutrient storage pool
[SPEAKER_03]: in phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are very, very tolerant to the
nutrient stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we try to induce the deficiency
symptom on phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to use a smaller plant because
we thought with a smaller plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have a smaller size of the nutrient
storage pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have to wait for about eight
months, even with a smaller plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get a deficiency symptom of the
nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is some chlorosis under the
phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will see the reduced growth under
some purple pigmentation under the
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will find some necrosis symptom
under the potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those kind of symptom of the deficiency
is very similar to that in other crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are also something different with
phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, they took a long time to have
the deficiency symptom and it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to induce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something different, for example,
for the deficiency of potassium,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can observe that on the upper leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the literature, most of the
deficiency symptom of potassium will
[SPEAKER_03]: appear in the lower leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also some similarity, also some
differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the part one of my talk, I want to show
you how good they are storing and utilize
[SPEAKER_03]: the nutrient with phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is another my favorite photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to show you they are very,
very tolerant to many kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can live in a cage that the bird
do not like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so from some of the data I just
showed you, we think there should be a
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very large pool of the stone
nitrogen in phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think this is a reason that different
researcher got different experimental
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another thing is that the phalaenopsis,
they respond very, very slowly to the
[SPEAKER_03]: application of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is also make it very difficult to
understand its nutrient requirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for my study, I want to distinguish the
stone nitrogen and the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in the plant tissue of
phalaenopsis, there's already so many
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen has been stored in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in amino acid, in protein,
in nucleic acid, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just put on fertilizer,
do different treatment, and we do the
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis, maybe we will just kind of get
the nitrogen level is already in the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, I use the stable isotope
nitrogen-15 to distinguish the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: has been stored in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the stone nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just think that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the stone nitrogen before we
started the experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the effect of fertilizer
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I miss the fertilizer effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We apply after the treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nitrogen-15 is a stable isotope,
and it has one more neutron than that of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen-14.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just use a mouse, we will be able to
distinguish nitrogen-15 and the
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen-14.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by this way, I will be able to kind of
compare the stone nitrogen and the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use the enrichment method of the
nitrogen-15 labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just apply the label fertilizer into
the substrate, and after a certain period
[SPEAKER_03]: of time, I will check the concentration in
different organ of the phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for each harvest, I would have dry
weight, and I will get nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration after analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by multiple of them, I will have
nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by multiple dry weight and nitrogen-15
concentration, I will get the nitrogen-15
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are some natural abundance of
nitrogen-15 in the nature, so we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: subtract them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after we do that, then we will get the
nitrogen-15 concentration at present
[SPEAKER_03]: access, and also the nitrogen content
access.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you say the access in the kind of
following data, you will know that result
[SPEAKER_03]: from the fertilizer treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have deducted the natural abundance
of nitrogen-15.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first isotope study.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will apply the label fertilizer,
and then in the 8-day period, we analyze
[SPEAKER_03]: the nitrogen-15 concentration in the first
leaf and in the fourth leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, because the first leaf was still
growing, so you will see the dry weight
[SPEAKER_03]: was increasing during the 8-day period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you can see that the nitrogen
content was also increased because the
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass is increasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you subtract this one by this one,
then you will know that the first leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: acquired 4.3 milligram of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember this, 4.3 milligram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the analysis of nitrogen-15,
you will see here first, the first leaf is
[SPEAKER_03]: a stronger sink than that of the fourth
leaf because they are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during these 8 days, kind of the first
leaf got 170 micrograms of nitrogen-15.
[SPEAKER_03]: But kind of we just have 22% of the
nitrogen-15 in the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by the calculation, we know during this
8-day period, the first leaf got only 0.5
[SPEAKER_03]: milligram of nitrogen fertilizer,
nitrogen from the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in previous slide, I say 4.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it means that the first leaf only got
12% of the nitrogen they got from the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about other 88% of the nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they are from somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's from the store nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I did another kind of clinical
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we checked the nitrogen-15 at a
different time, from the vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_03]: to the reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here, you can see it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the newly grown leaf, and this is
the root.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during the vegetative growth,
these two organs were strong sink for
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after the phalaenopsis has the spike,
the nitrogen-15 concentration in the root
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that further decreased when the
inflorescence was developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it means that root can add as a storage
organ for the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then provide the nitrogen for the
further development of the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got similar result by checking
the nitrogen-15 content.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nitrogen-15 content in the mature leaf
decreased when the inflorescence was
[SPEAKER_03]: developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we further conduct another
research to check kind of the storage
[SPEAKER_03]: function of the mature leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because this is different from what we
saw in the literature, so we have to prove
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put a label fertilizer on,
and then we let it kind of last for eight
[SPEAKER_03]: week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during this eight week, the nitrogen-15
will just be partitioned to many of the
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of older organ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we do the root excision.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is no root has been removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% and 75% of the root has been excised.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to know, so what would happen
if we remove some of the root?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, for the nitrogen-15 content,
you will see that with the more root has
[SPEAKER_03]: been removed, the nitrogen-15 content in
the root decrease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's obvious, because we remove the
root.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we remove the nitrogen-15 from the
root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from here, the newly grown leaf,
the treatment, you will see that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: the nitrogen content is quite stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no difference between the treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same for the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they are strong sink, so the
phalaenops just do their best to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: the nitrogen to the newly growing organ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is very, very interesting that
surprise us is that the decrease of the
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen-15 content in the mature leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of prune the root,
and then you got the result of the reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen-15 content in the mature leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that the mature leaf also has a
function of nitrogen storage, and they can
[SPEAKER_03]: provide nitrogen to the newly grown leaf
or to the inflorescence during the
[SPEAKER_03]: reproductive stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is very interesting that mature
leaf in phalaenopsis also act as a
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen storage organ that can provide
nitrogen to the inflorescence development.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that for the inflorescence
development, some of the nitrogen came
[SPEAKER_03]: from the stone nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, I want to know, so for the
nitrogen here, will that just come from
[SPEAKER_03]: this stage, or this stage, or every stage?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a very, very small size plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the medium size.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is large size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each stage took about four to five
months, so each stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the first experiment, it's under
n-perfect dilation, kind of, I compare
[SPEAKER_03]: these three stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the second experiment,
I compare just the large size plant stage
[SPEAKER_03]: and the forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the phalaenopsis, they grow so
slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for this one single experiment,
it took me two years to come complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I have to separate these two
experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also have another experiment
that I did that under n-perfect dilation
[SPEAKER_03]: and under reduced fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of three experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, we give nitrogen 15-level
fertilizer to different stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after six weeks of treatment,
we repot it to remove the nitrogen 15 that
[SPEAKER_03]: we gave to the phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, we have the negative control,
no nitrogen 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is the positive control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We apply nitrogen 15 to all the three
stages of the growth, just as a positive
[SPEAKER_03]: control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to emphasize that all the
nitrogen level applied to all the
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment, they were all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between the treatment is
just the timing of the nitrogen 15
[SPEAKER_03]: labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, when the plant was flowering,
so it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from the young plant stage to this part
visible stage, it's more than one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about 16 months or 14 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then in the infarct presence, we found the
nitrogen 15 from the small size plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: the medium size plant, and the large size
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it means that because of the small
size, it's just this big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the kind of the large size,
it's like this big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even a very, very young phalaenopsis
plant, they can store nitrogen and provide
[SPEAKER_03]: the nitrogen for the infarct presence
development, even one year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a very strong capacity to
store the nutrient, even a very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very young plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of the total nitrogen
content in a small size plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: a medium size plant, and a large size
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because the large size plant,
they have more biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the total nitrogen content is
higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was one thing very, very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how much nitrogen they have
accumulated during that single stage,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was about a certain percent of
nitrogen has been stored and used to
[SPEAKER_03]: provide the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a percentage of 6% to 8%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very, very special kind of
characteristic for the phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of the finding for this experiment
is that they can store the nitrogen very
[SPEAKER_03]: well and provide the nitrogen later for
the inflorescence development,
[SPEAKER_03]: even one year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we kind of calculate the relative
contribution to the inflorescence
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen, it's kind of, you will get this
number, 16, 25, and the 95, 59% for
[SPEAKER_03]: different stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had the kind of experiment B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just compare kind of the large size
plant stage during the vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I apply that during the
reproductive stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to say again that all the
treatment receive the same amount of total
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you will see, if we apply the
nitrogen 15 during the vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_03]: the newly grown leaf will have the most
kind of the higher nitrogen 15
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration because they are the strong
sink during this stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we apply the nitrogen 15 during the
reproductive stage, the inflorescence will
[SPEAKER_03]: have a kind of high amount of nitrogen 15
content among the organ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of the strong sink during
the reproductive stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we apply this nitrogen 15 content,
if we apply the nitrogen 15 during the
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative stage, they will store it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, you will find 79
micrograms of nitrogen 15 in the
[SPEAKER_03]: inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you apply the nitrogen 15 during
the reproductive stage, it will end up in
[SPEAKER_03]: the inflorescence 174 microgram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can do kind of the relative
contribution for these two stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the kind of the relative
contribution is 31% from the large plant
[SPEAKER_03]: size stage, and the 69% from the
fertilizer, we just apply to phalaenopsis
[SPEAKER_03]: during the forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so because for the nitrogen
fertilizer we applied during the forcing
[SPEAKER_03]: period is accounted for 69% of the
nitrogen in the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very important to continue supply
nitrogen even during the forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had the experiment A, we got the
ratio of contribution, we have experiment
[SPEAKER_03]: B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we can calculate kind of the
relative contribution because they both
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment has the same stage of the large
size plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the nitrogen in the inflorescence,
7% from the small size stage, 11 from the
[SPEAKER_03]: medium size, 25% from the large size plant
stage, and 57% of the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: inflorescence came from the fertilizer we
just applied during the forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very, very important to give them
sufficient nitrogen even during the
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then for the next experiment is kind of
very, very complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have kind of, we try to reduce the
fertilizer level during the forcing
[SPEAKER_03]: period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see how they utilize the store
nutrient if they encounter the nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the full fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: We label it at different time,
vegetative stage, reproductive stage,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the further reduce strength of the
fertilizer the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two label, kind of two time, kind of two
stage of the nitrogen labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for this one, we didn't give any
nitrogen to phalaenopsis during the
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we got, we checked the nitrogen 15
concentration in the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will read this graph like this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is ample fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is reduced fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we reduce the fertilization
during the forcing period, you will get
[SPEAKER_03]: more nitrogen 15 in the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it means if when they encounter
nutrient stress, they will use more the
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen has been stored in the plant
tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will do a kind of, I will show you
kind of the data for comparing the two
[SPEAKER_03]: stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same calculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So under ample fertilization, kind of the
large size plant stage, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: accounted for 43%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the nitrogen fertilization,
the fertilizer 57%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we reduce the fertilization
during the forcing period, the ratio
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the stone nitrogen accounted for
89% under the fertilizer nitrogen just
[SPEAKER_03]: accounted for 11% because we reduce the
supply of fertilizer during the forcing
[SPEAKER_03]: period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, if we didn't give the
phalaenopsis any fertilizer, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% of nitrogen in the inflorescence came
from the stone nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will be able to store the nitrogen
and they use it for the inflorescence
[SPEAKER_03]: development later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I'm showing you the kind of effect
of the reduced fertilization during the
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you got a very, very healthy
phalaenopsis to start with, then the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of the fertilizer nitrogen during
the forcing period was minor because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just a difference of two flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can still perform well on flowering
of the kind of flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the finding here is that stone nitrogen
becomes a very, very important nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: source for the inflorescence development
when the fertility level is limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the second part, I would like to
kind of show you some information very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very briefly for the progressive change of
the nitrogen or the carbon when the
[SPEAKER_03]: phalaenopsis are developing, I mean,
for all this kind of organ older stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to know the effect of nitrogen
fertilizer on the flowering of
[SPEAKER_03]: phalaenopsis because many of the growers,
they think they can kind of change the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering of phalaenopsis by mini-pad the
fertilization during the forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we check kind of the carbon and
the nitrogen level at different stage and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we will get the CN ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to research on this kind of
standard type of phalaenopsis for such a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not the result.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here I add one more cultivar is a
miniature type.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a miniature is something that just
very, very compact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the standard type is kind of huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to know kind of the trend of the
CN ratio changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the result.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will see some data here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, for the carbon concentration,
they are relatively stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just kind of range from 41% to
43%.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's quite stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you will find a decreasing trend on
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they was young, when they were
just depressed, high nitrogen about 4%.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they get mature and they were
able to flower, it just dropped to about
[SPEAKER_03]: 2%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will find a kind of decreasing
trend when they get mature, become more
[SPEAKER_03]: mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because this is stable, this is
decreasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the CN ratio, you will find an
increased strength trend as the plant get
[SPEAKER_03]: more mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we want to know if we change the
nitrogen level during the forcing period
[SPEAKER_03]: will not affect the performance,
the flowering performance of these two
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the standard type.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the miniature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, here for the nitrogen
concentration, when we reduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer nitrogen, that will reduce the
nitrogen concentration in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is quite significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this means that the CN ratio will
increase as the fertilizer nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: decrease because the carbon level is quite
stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then how about the flowering?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, for the standard type
phalaenopsis, the change in the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen did affect this two spiking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at the number,
with the control, it's just about two day
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So practically, I would consider kind of
no influence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the miniature type, you will see
some impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you increase the nitrogen level
during the forcing period, that will delay
[SPEAKER_03]: the spiking for about nine days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of the fertilizer nitrogen
manipulation has more influence impact on
[SPEAKER_03]: the miniature type phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, it's quite simple because they
just has a kind of smaller nitrogen pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this is just to show you kind of
the deficiency of nitrogen will advance in
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering for about two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the miniature type, with high rate
of nitrogen, that may delay the flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: For about nine days, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of the fertilizer nitrogen has
more impact on miniature type phalaenopsis
[SPEAKER_03]: than the standard type phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, I think kind of the flowering
number is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even we change the fertilizer rate
during the forcing period, for the
[SPEAKER_03]: standard type phalaenopsis, the flower
number was not affected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But changing the fertilizer nitrogen will
affect the flowering number in the
[SPEAKER_03]: miniature phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, just because they have less kind of
smaller pool of nitrogen, still nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but kind of there was some effect,
but with a lower rate of nitrogen will
[SPEAKER_03]: decrease the number of the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't recommend the grower to reduce
the nitrogen during the kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will just show you the photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nitrogen rate during forcing did not
affect the standard type of phalaenopsis
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But lower rate of the nitrogen during
forcing will reduce the flower number of
[SPEAKER_03]: phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the kind of the conclusion for
the previous two experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not too much effect on the standard
type phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some effect on the miniature type.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lower rate of the nitrogen during
forcing will advance the flowering,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the high rate would delay the
flowering of the miniature type
[SPEAKER_03]: phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But kind of the flowering quality,
the best flowering quality, still come
[SPEAKER_03]: from the regular nitrogen fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't need to reduce or terminate
the nitrogen application during forcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just because they have
different size of still nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this also explains kind of the
inconsistent result has been exist in the
[SPEAKER_03]: literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then kind of for the last part,
I want to kind of demonstrate the optimal
[SPEAKER_03]: medium EC for the phalaenopsis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because from my previous experiment,
we knew that we have to give phalaenopsis
[SPEAKER_03]: continuous fertilization, even from a
very, very young plant throughout to the
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we give, we get different rate of
fertilizer to phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with higher rate of fertilization,
you will have kind of higher shoot dry
[SPEAKER_03]: weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that will decrease the root biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think it's very important to keep
the good balance of the shoot to root
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have that for the treatment at 100
part per million nitrogen of the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a good growth here,
and then they also have a good flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for this, the medium EC was range from
0.6 to 1.0 deciC per meter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we want to know the root quality,
the relationship between the root quality
[SPEAKER_03]: under the medium EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: By this way, we can also determine the
optimum medium EC So we did an experiment
[SPEAKER_03]: in 10 nursery in Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found that to have a good root
quality, the medium EC must be below 0.9,
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we concluded that the fertilizer
rate at 100 part per million nitrogen was
[SPEAKER_03]: about right under the medium EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the target EC can be target at 1.0 if
we are doing that by pull-through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I gave this recommendation to the
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the target EC is 1.0 deciC per meter if
they are doing that by pull-through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of growers, they like to use a
facility like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they are using a Delta TWT sensor,
the target EC is 1.0 deciC per meter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do the regression between the data
we obtained from this facility and the
[SPEAKER_03]: data from pull-through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then after this, then we tested this
idea on more than 7,000 plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: 7,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got good results and very,
very confident about this recommendation
[SPEAKER_03]: to the federal analysis grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then here comes to my conclusion that
this is the deficiency symptom for
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen for phosphorus and for potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a little bit similar with
other crop, but they are something
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a very, very good capacity to
store nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes the symptoms are different
because the nitrogen is the symptom of the
[SPEAKER_03]: potassium deficiency appear on the upper
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the deficiency was very,
very severe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the sink and the source
relationship for nitrogen, the newly grown
[SPEAKER_03]: organ is the major sink during the
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the inflorescence is the major
nitrogen sink during the reproductive
[SPEAKER_03]: stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what organ acts as the nitrogen source
is the mature leaf under the root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are very, very good on stored
nutrients and stored nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even a very, very young plant,
they can store the nitrogen for more than
[SPEAKER_03]: one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're useful for the development of
the phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because the fertilizer nitrogen we
apply during the forcing period accounted
[SPEAKER_03]: for 57% of the nitrogen inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very, very important to keep
giving the phalaenopsis a deprecate
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although we can change the CN ratio by
the reduction of nitrogen during the
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing period, but that has a kind of
little effect on the flowering of the
[SPEAKER_03]: phalaenopsis if they have already stored a
lot of amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe by doing this, the quality of the
phalaenopsis will be sacrificed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't recommend to reduce the
nitrogen during the forcing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because they are epiphyte and they
cannot tolerate to high salt, but we have
[SPEAKER_03]: to give them a continuous supply of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will recommend to test the medium EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be targeted at 1.0 by pull
through and the 1.1 by the Delta TW ET
[SPEAKER_03]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what I want to share with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank very much for the invitation
to be here to kind of see the campus
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank my students for conducting the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also thank the financial support
from Taiwan government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all my talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to have your comment or
take any of your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we could have some questions and we
probably, should I go to Geneva?
[SPEAKER_02]: Geneva, are there any questions from
Geneva?
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast crowd here has no questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is, did you look at
concentrations lower than 100 ppm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, in different kind of study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not in this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we checked something like 50,
25, but because kind of in other
[SPEAKER_03]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't bring it up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 100 ppm is optimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second question is, for ORF kids,
you differentiated fertilizer nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: from stored nitrogen using 15.
But they're the third source though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, when you grow the plant in any
medium, unless it's pure sand,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's always some nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you take that into consideration?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of, kind of, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes we cannot rule out the
influence from the substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here, because we are comparing that,
kind of both treatment, they were all in
[SPEAKER_03]: speckled moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do the labeling at different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some kind of rule out effect of the
speckled moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if we just kind of, of course,
for the kind of the deficiency of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen, it's difficult because it will
take even longer because there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for kind of the older nitrogen 15
study, it's okay because they both have
[SPEAKER_03]: the same substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we have to think about the
nitrogen that was provided by the speckled
[SPEAKER_03]: moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the back, yeah.
So when you say nitrogen, you have a
relation between ammonium and nitrate?
Yes.
So what is this ratio and it changes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it mostly ammonium because you're
under low pH?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's also a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so kind of the gentleman,
yes, kind of the nitrogen form will have
[SPEAKER_03]: some effect on the kind of growth of the
priority of phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did the research and the kind of,
the best kind of ratio, the nitrogen form
[SPEAKER_03]: is kind of the nitrate should be high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something like more than 75%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So phalaenops grow quite well with high
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 75% nitrate or 100% nitrate,
but they just don't like that much of
[SPEAKER_03]: ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is when we are talking
about a nitrogen form, we have to consider
[SPEAKER_03]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you grow the phalaenopsis,
you will always find a very, very low pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using speckled moss as a substrate,
the pH could be as low as 2.8,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very difficult for us to image,
but it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but actually from my study,
the fertilizer will make the pH low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most important factor is the root
of phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The root of phalaenopsis will make the
substrate more acid and down to the pH of
[SPEAKER_03]: three.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just like some acid environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's because phalaenopsis are
amplified.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just do their best to acquire
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they may release something acid to
exchange for the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I know about the nitrogen
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever use the terms autophagy or
remobilization for the nitrogen that's
[SPEAKER_02]: stored?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't check that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious about how your plants in
your research project were grown or
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it all tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was doing research, I was very,
very picky for the uniformity of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I buy the most expensive plant material
in Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then kind of if I need 200 plants,
I will buy 250 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for some research, for the length
of the first leaf, I even make them all
[SPEAKER_03]: the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of the leaves, the size of the
first leaf, even all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are very, very uniform plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their propagation technique,
I have read many years ago that they
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced fungus into tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still done?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they are some mycorrhizae,
kind of they are important for the
[SPEAKER_03]: germination and the germination of the
orchid seed in the early stage of the
[SPEAKER_03]: orchid seedling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But commercially, we can just use
fertilizer to have a good growth of the
[SPEAKER_03]: phalaenopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't need to do that during the
tissue culture stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You looked at mycorrhizae and did a very
nice job of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you would find a similar
pattern for phosphorous and potassium to
[SPEAKER_01]: the co-mobile mycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because kind of in the very, very
beginning, I show you that we give
[SPEAKER_03]: different rate of nitrogen, different rate
of phosphorus, and different rate of
[SPEAKER_03]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of behavior is very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my research, I demonstrate that
there's a kind of large pool of stone
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's the same for other element.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's their response to the nutrient
deficiency while very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think that's really the case
for the potassium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the potassium deficiency showing
in the upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean this, they also have a kind of
the storage function of potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with a very, very healthy plant,
you withheld the potassium for one and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half year.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are still doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
OK.
No more questions?
I have a request.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ship the extra plants to Bill so they
have a wild class.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will consider that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm impressed is that we have heard
of an herbaceous plant that takes two
[SPEAKER_02]: years to do an experiment on my line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just your apple tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Alex, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
