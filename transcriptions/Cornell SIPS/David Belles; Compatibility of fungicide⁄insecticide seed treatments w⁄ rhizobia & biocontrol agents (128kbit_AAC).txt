[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the committee and Alan for
this opportunity to give an update on some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that we have going on with
compatibility for fungicides and
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide seed treatments with rhizobia
and biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a really interesting
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times when I'm asked to give
a presentation, these type of talks to
[SPEAKER_00]: groups like this are really interesting to
me because it's a topic that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different than I'm normally used to
talking to, which is more about how our
[SPEAKER_00]: products work and efficacy and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I give one of these talks,
I do quite a bit of research and I tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a lot about this new topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in this case too that I really
felt like I was able to learn some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that through this time that we
spend here in the next few minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you some of that information
that I learned and that you'll find it
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhizobia are important in legume crops
for increased nodulation and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their use decreases the need for synthetic
fertilizers and helps growers farm more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizobia products are often seed applied
and the advances in seed applied
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol agents have also occurred in
recent years and many new products are
[SPEAKER_00]: being brought to the market and are often
seed applied as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungicide insecticide seed treatments are
still very valuable to growers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility of these different products
are very important to ensure that growers
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting the expected benefit of all
the products applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizobia and biocontrol compatibility
begins with the design of the fungicide or
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide formulation and includes the
active ingredient as well as the choice of
[SPEAKER_00]: inert ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compatibility is evaluated at several
stages which I'll go through through the
[SPEAKER_00]: development process and is often checked
by rhizobia product companies as well
[SPEAKER_00]: before commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also responsible biocontrol product
companies are also testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility of their products when it
makes sense and they believe that their
[SPEAKER_00]: product is going to be applied as a seed
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by working together the industry is
really trying hard to make sure that these
[SPEAKER_00]: products are working together and can be
used effectively to the best maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and farm sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in a summary really what I've
been trying I want to share with you today
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to go into a lot more detail
now about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know rhizobia is a genus of soil
bacteria and the fact that it's bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: means that this is a living organism
that's being applied to the seed and that
[SPEAKER_00]: brings certain considerations that we need
to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important feature of these rhizobium is
that they're very specific to the legume
[SPEAKER_00]: or that they're being applied to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are only specific to a
very small amount of the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example some of them are only nodulate
on alpha species whereas other rhizobium
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very broad spectrum across a number
of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us there's rhizobium legunosorum is
nodulates on pea crops and bradyrhizobium
[SPEAKER_00]: japonica nodulates in soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because we're not just
talking about one specific bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: organism that is applied across all crops
that we need to worry about but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: many different rhizobia species that we
have to think about and test for when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about compatibility with
seed treatments that are also going on
[SPEAKER_00]: that same space on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have a picture here of you can
see the nodulation on the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're talking about is these
rhizobia that are applied to the seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: then or in furrow in some cases and then
cause these nodulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is really doing is this
rhizobia bacteria is colonizing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cells within root nodules and they convert
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia causing
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme nitrogenase and then provide
organic nitrogenous compounds such as
[SPEAKER_00]: glutamine or urides to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really helping the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant in turn is providing the
bacteria with organic compounds made by
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and this is a mutually
beneficial relationship and it is true of
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobia which is example which of which
the genus rhizobium is a typical example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this mutually beneficial relationship
is something that we really want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we're protecting and make sure that
we're taking advantage of especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to reduce fertilizer use,
synthetic fertilizer use as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to increase our soil
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhizobium can be formulated with other
microorganisms well to improve or add
[SPEAKER_00]: additional benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just taken a snip here from a
Nova Zeim's document and you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a rhizobium leginosorum but
there's also penicillium on here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these rhizobium products can actually
take different carriers or different
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have peat, you can have granulars
or you could have liquid inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these need to be considered as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit about the rhizobium
but what about a seed treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And although it sometimes might seem like
it, you know you just had a nice talk from
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Marks and you can make these seeds
look really nice and it might seem like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about the colors and the shiny
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about what the products are
doing to protect them against insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and diseases which are mainly
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have been very useful to growers
and they're getting a lot of benefit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here if you have an untreated
seeds and you have planted in the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of pythium sometimes you'll basically get
no plants but a treated seed can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: you from pythium and this can be
demonstrated in little rhizotrons like
[SPEAKER_00]: this where we've inoculated the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also do petri plate studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here an untreated petri plate
with rhizoctonia in the center and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizoctonia mycelium growing out across
the seeds whereas the treated seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: protected from the rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the benefit that these seed
treatments are giving to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanna be able to combine both of
these technologies together and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: use them efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them both to perform well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about the pesticide
formulation there is the pesticide active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient that is the main component that
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing that's going to be
controlling the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's carriers, water or organic
solvents that are also in those
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the inert or other
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking about compatibility
with something like a rhizobium or
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria we really need to consider all of
these inert ingredients as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that can be in there are
surfactants or adjuvants, stabilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have dyes or colorants and
safeners as well as antifreezes to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: from freezing in cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that is often or almost
always put into a pesticide formulation or
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed treatment formulation are synthetic
biocides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the synthetic biocides are placed in
there so we don't get bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination growing in the jug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever opened a jug and it smells
really bad you know you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial contamination and the biocides
weren't doing their job so these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: components of a seed treatment formulation
and you can see that some of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause some problems when you're
trying to be compatible with an organic or
[SPEAKER_00]: with an organism that's a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic solvents, biopests, biocides could
be an issue and so we need to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and how are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say you know, Syngentis has
a long history of developing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this for over 40 years
and we spend a lot of money and time
[SPEAKER_00]: investing in our formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly four million dollars a day and we
don't want to have a product that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come to the market and not be
successful or not be able to be used
[SPEAKER_00]: because of its incompatibility with a
rhizobium or another biocontrol product
[SPEAKER_00]: that our growers really want to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help us with this we do have dedicated
seed care specialists around the country
[SPEAKER_00]: that listen to growers and try to
understand how our products are working
[SPEAKER_00]: and there also can be resources for you if
you're having an issue with one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: products or have questions about them you
can always contact one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a facility in Minnesota which is a
seed care institute where we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: training but this is also where we do
application testing like Peter was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about and we have inoculum testing program
as well as our seed safety testing
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does Syngenta do to keep our
products compatible with inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually in the formulation development of
a new seed treatment we do do tests for
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility and these tests are
primarily to put the product on the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: after oh well we applied treat the seed
and then we put the inoculum on top and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll see how long those inoculum
last on the seed or how long it survives
[SPEAKER_00]: on the seed and we have a certain
threshold that we want to maintain for the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of a bacterial bacteria that are
still alive on the seed after a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time and so we do test that in
the development process we only test a few
[SPEAKER_00]: of those to make sure that this product's
not a significant issue and if it passes
[SPEAKER_00]: that test then we'll continue with the
development of that formulation and we
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that it'll be successful we'll go
ahead and freeze that formulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However before after kind of after the the
product's frozen or we've got a good idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what that product's going to be we've
gone through some tests we will offer our
[SPEAKER_00]: products for testing to other inoculant
manufacturers for testing prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization and if we come back and
there's some big issues we will withhold
[SPEAKER_00]: that product from the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently the only company that's really
been taking us up on this offer is
[SPEAKER_00]: Novozymes so I'm going to be sharing some
information from Novozymes but we do they
[SPEAKER_00]: do test the compatibility of all our new
formulations and treatments with their
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant products and it's something that
Syngenta doesn't really have the expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: to do and how so we have the inoculant
companies are really good at testing those
[SPEAKER_00]: things and we have them them do that and
they give us back the information and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they publish it in a guide so you can
download this guide I did last week from
[SPEAKER_00]: from Novozymes and it's a compatibility
guide and it gives you by crop all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different products that they have I've
just taken a sniff of one of them which is
[SPEAKER_00]: tag team peat and then it lists all of the
products that have been tested by Syngenta
[SPEAKER_00]: or I'm tested by Novozymes I'm sorry and
you can see there's a pretty big list of
[SPEAKER_00]: those products here and I just want to
highlight a few this one is a apron max
[SPEAKER_00]: RFC the RFC actually stood for rhizobium
friendly constant concentrate we did makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the modifications to the formulation to
help it be more friendly to to rhizobium
[SPEAKER_00]: actually than the original apron max RTA
formulation and you can see that it did
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to improve the planting window and
this planting window is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum amount of time that can elapse
between the date the seed was treated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bio bio enhancer or rhizobium and when
it can be planted with an expectation that
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizobium will remain viable and
generally this is I've seen these really
[SPEAKER_00]: the the maximum here is 48 hours on all of
these tests that they do however we know
[SPEAKER_00]: from some of our internal testing that
they do last on the seed but they can last
[SPEAKER_00]: on seed longer but generally the the
greatest limit here is 48 hours there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some products older products sometimes or
other formulations that you'll see are not
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended at all for whatever reason
they were not compatible with the inoculum
[SPEAKER_00]: product and so those are ones that you
really need to to look at and watch out
[SPEAKER_00]: for and maybe choose a different inoculum
that was more compatible with the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to apply or potentially
choose a different seed treatment product
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said we do do testing you know we
offer our products for testing so these
[SPEAKER_00]: are products that aren't on the list or on
on the guide yet so these are new Syngenta
[SPEAKER_00]: products that have been recently
commercialized and we've done testing with
[SPEAKER_00]: those and you can see that they're also 48
hours for the simultaneous sequential and
[SPEAKER_00]: tank mixed timings application timings and
if you don't see one of the products on
[SPEAKER_00]: the application guide from the inoculant
company the manufacturer of the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment may have this information with
them and we do put this information in our
[SPEAKER_00]: technical bulletins and technical
presentations so it it is available
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that those guides aren't
updated all the time so how do we avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with the seed treatment and
inoculants we want to avoid using products
[SPEAKER_00]: with negative effects of course when the
formulation process we're trying to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that would be trying to avoid
the ones that are really a negative and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always the acute toxicity the
exposure dose and the length of exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you see this lady girl sitting here
this is a famous painting from the from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1800s and there's a really nice green
wallpaper in the background and she's
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky that she had the window open here
because this green wallpaper in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Victorian areas was color was due to
arsenic and they used arsenic to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: green color in the in the wallpaper and
they had a lot of problems with people
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting sick when in the winter
it was closed up and they would be in here
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually get sick from the arsenic in
the in the wallpaper that was coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: so if she had she's lucky she has the
window open if she'd been outside or away
[SPEAKER_00]: from that she could have avoided it or
taken down the wallpaper eliminated that
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're able to not be exposed to that
toxic toxicity so in similarly for to test
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility we have different ways we
can apply the the the inoculum or the the
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol agent you can do a simultaneous
application a sequential action
[SPEAKER_00]: application or a tank mix application tank
mix application is kind of like being
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the room with with the product
this is a diagram that I got from a BSF
[SPEAKER_00]: document from Canada and it shows very
nicely what a sequential application is
[SPEAKER_00]: where the seed treatment must be applied
and allowed to dry before the inoculant is
[SPEAKER_00]: applied the simultaneous application the
seed treatment can be applied at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time as the inoculant but separate
applicators must be used and then the tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mix application basically the inoculant is
mixed directly with the diluted seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment and applied as one solution
however they do recommend that the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of the slurry that's mixed up and
you have to be applied within six hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other people recommend within
four hours there is also a best practices
[SPEAKER_00]: guide so Nova Science has produced a bioag
best practices guide for using inoculants
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has a lot of really good
information around how to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms working and compatibility with
seed treatments for living organisms you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they depend on us as applicators
to exercise good storage practices before
[SPEAKER_00]: and after the application you want to make
sure that there's cool temperatures that
[SPEAKER_00]: favor the survival of the bacteria found
in the inoculants store the products and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to which the products have been
applied in a cool dry place and refer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions on the product and seed
labels for specific recommendations on how
[SPEAKER_00]: to best keep those organisms happy the
other thing is you can have a dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: tank and for the inoculum and a pumping
system this will allow for easy management
[SPEAKER_00]: of the inoculant or biological products
and while the standard seed treatments are
[SPEAKER_00]: generally stable if left in a mixed tank
for a few days before consumed it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: true for inoculants a dedicated tank would
allow you to open and mix only what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need for immediate use and keeping your
inoculant source as fresh and as viable as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and even with the dedicated tank
need to apply all of the product within 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours after opening and if you don't have
a dedicated tank you can choose to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants with the treatment but if this
is done that like I said you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: using all of that slurry with up within
four to six hours and another important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is to clean out your equipment and
make sure that you have good sanitation
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout so that the seed treatment and
the inoculant that you use in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: batch are also compatible or make sure
things are clean another thing that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people don't really think about is the
water so you may be treating with a city
[SPEAKER_00]: water and as we know they treat city water
with chlorine to help kill microbes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water so this is not going to be
compatible with your inoculum and so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're treating with the city water which
has chlorine added you may want to install
[SPEAKER_00]: a water filter which is designed to remove
the chlorine or use a spare tank where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hold the water for 24 hours and allow
the chlorine to dissipate before you use
[SPEAKER_00]: it in your slurry also many treaters use
soybean oil to help or other oils to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with the treatment process and generally
this has been shown not to be an issue and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem to have any effect or harm on
the on the bacteria and it also may even
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the quality a little bit because
it dries a little bit slower than just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight water it's also important to
check all of the other things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to the the mixture the slurry in
addition to the seed treatment part you
[SPEAKER_00]: could add other polymers or colors or
maybe another product from somewhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure you check all of
those when you're applying it with a with
[SPEAKER_00]: an inoculant so important to think about
all of the things that are going into your
[SPEAKER_00]: slurry I've talked a lot about the
inoculants I've talked about the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments and now another growing area is
really a biological so a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals could be living organisms as
well what are really growers looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: for a biological we're trying to unlock
soil bound nutrients we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance access to those nutrients fix
atmospheric nitrogen stimulate development
[SPEAKER_00]: or protect against pathogens so and some
of these can be alive organisms or plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts small peptides all kinds of
things that you want to make sure those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the integrity of those is maintained
when you're mixing them for biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: usually these can be it could be viruses
bacterial fungal pathogens pheromones or
[SPEAKER_00]: botanicals or other substances in
biostimulants you could have microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: products nitrogen fixing bacteria algal
extracts humic acids amino acids peptides
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes vitamins all kinds of things
nutrients are usually micro or macro
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that generally are not
considered incompatible with the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments in a living sense but could be
incompatible from a physical chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: type of sense so if the biological or the
organism is actually a living organism the
[SPEAKER_00]: same kind of rules would apply as we've
talked about for the rhizobium bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure that those are happy
and those conditions for that organism are
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied and want to test and make sure
that those bacteria are still alive on the
[SPEAKER_00]: on the seed after after application that
is compatible and the testing for this
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility is done by a lot of the
biological companies that are bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: these new products to the market we're
often approached by companies that ask for
[SPEAKER_00]: product to test when they're starting out
trying to determine if they can apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: product to the seed and if that would be a
mechanism of delivery for their product or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially they would have to go in
furrow and do an application that way
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of applying it with the seed
treatment they're also trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out whether they can do the tank mix or it
would be built it could be built into a
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation a seed treatment formulation
or if it's better doing a sequential
[SPEAKER_00]: application something like that and so
this there's a lot of work that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: done in this this area but if you're not
sure about the products you're using or if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been tested it's always good to
ask you know ask the manufacturer what
[SPEAKER_00]: what the compatibility is and what kind of
testing has been done we do Syngenta
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't do a lot of compatibility testing
of all the products the biological
[SPEAKER_00]: products on the market unless we have an
agreement with that company that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in their biological or they've
asked us to test it or asked us to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: some product for them to test but there is
testing going on so I did mention you know
[SPEAKER_00]: just a lot about the biologicals that
we're thinking about and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible trying to keep them alive but
there's also physical compatibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other products that I
mentioned the humic acids the they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not living but they're products
that are being applied on the seed as
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals and it's important to look at
the compatibility of those if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply those at the same time or put
them into your slurry and one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to do that is to do a jar test and
you can learn a lot from a jar test
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll save you a lot of trouble cleaning
out lines and tanks and cleaning up a mess
[SPEAKER_00]: later we do tests with our products with
biological that we are thinking about or
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that may be put into a into a tank
mix and one of the things we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for is the incompatibility just physical
incompatibility change in viscosity change
[SPEAKER_00]: in appearance or physical behavior or
separation like you can see here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: this jar and that's something you want to
try to avoid sometimes there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of separation but if it's recirculated
easily then we usually say that that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be acceptable there's also compatibilities
where we increase the temperature decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature make sure that in a range
of temperatures it's okay so there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of tests that are done with just physical
compatibility also it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean the equipment when changing
formulation types just good cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: really helps out with seed treating and
making sure that everything is is
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible and flowing easily and another
one way to clean out easily is using a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple green something like that so I did
go through quickly quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information and I just wanted to talk a
little bit about some of the sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: the information I have there's the bio
Novozymes bio ag seed treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility guide this I did take some
information from the 2013 one but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that was updated more recently
and there's the best practices guide
[SPEAKER_00]: that's available online from this January
