[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my name is Mirsa Arsyaty-Arsyat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm second year's PhD student in Yanik
Lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, I'd like to present what we
have been doing and also preliminary
[SPEAKER_05]: results on winter oats and pea
intercropping.
[SPEAKER_05]: And firstly, I'd like to define what
intercropping system is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so intercropping or mixed cropping is
simultaneous cultivation of two or more
[SPEAKER_05]: crops in the same field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an ancient agricultural practice
that has been implemented for years,
[SPEAKER_05]: in particularly Africa and also Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But recently, it's just been gaining
renewed interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that provides more efficiency and
also sustainability in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, there's also a couple
benefits for intercropping, which are
[SPEAKER_05]: increased total yield and yield stability,
improve soil health, reduce impact,
[SPEAKER_05]: and also increase resilience of the crops
against pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one combination that has been
planted in this system, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: combination of winter oats and also peas
that's believed to provide a synergic
[SPEAKER_05]: complementary that's where oats provide
structural support to the peas and pea
[SPEAKER_05]: help oats to nitrogen fixing that support
the growth of the oats.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with these backgrounds, we came up
with one research question, which is,
[SPEAKER_05]: how do we select the best winter oats
accession for winter oats and pea
[SPEAKER_05]: intercropping system?
[SPEAKER_05]: And for answering this question,
we have been doing trials, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: winter oats and peas trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our first year's trial in 2023 to
2024, we planted 94 winter oats accession
[SPEAKER_05]: from three different sources in
combination with one winter peas variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was Blaise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we planted these crops in incomplete
block designs where monocrop and also
[SPEAKER_05]: intercrop uploads planted side by side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the total uploads was 378 uploads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for preliminary result of this trial,
we use a mixed model to calculate this
[SPEAKER_05]: heritability of five traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here you can see that there's
variation or there's variation in
[SPEAKER_05]: heritability from low to high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially here we can see that high
heritability on oats freeze damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we make a box pot for oats and
pea grain shield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see here, there's no much
difference on oats grain shield if we want
[SPEAKER_05]: to compare between intercrop and also
monocrop.
[SPEAKER_05]: In contrast to oats for pea grain shield,
there's significant, not significant,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's lower grain shield in
intercrop compared to monocrop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tried to confirm these results by
calculate the correlation between the
[SPEAKER_05]: traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows here that there's negative
moderate correlation between oats grain
[SPEAKER_05]: yield versus pea grain yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next analysis, what we have,
we did that we tried to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_05]: how the general mixing ability with these
oats actuation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me briefly explain about general
mixing ability here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here general mixing ability shows that
how the oats actuation performs in the
[SPEAKER_05]: intercropping with pea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for these general mixing ability,
it's divided into two, which are producer
[SPEAKER_05]: effect and also associate effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: For associate effect means that how these
winter oats actuation influence the oats
[SPEAKER_05]: grain shield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for associate effect here that
represents how the oats actuation here
[SPEAKER_05]: affect the grain shield of the pea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this graph, you can see there's a
couple of green points here that
[SPEAKER_05]: represents or shows the actuation with
positive producer effect and also positive
[SPEAKER_05]: associate effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want, and in detail,
you can see all these actuation on the
[SPEAKER_05]: table at the right side.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 18th actuation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That have positive in both effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there's also positive general
mixing ability on the red point here
[SPEAKER_05]: that's located above this diagonal lines
or identity lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, after using index
selection, we were able to select 72
[SPEAKER_05]: winter oats actuation from our first
year's trial and added more 16th actuation
[SPEAKER_05]: from green, which are assumed to be pure
winter oats, winter oats actuation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we combine all these actuation and we
plant it in our second year's trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what comes next, is we are expecting
to collect more data in this spring and
[SPEAKER_05]: also harvest the trial in summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to thanks to my PIA,
John Luke Yenick, for giving me this
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to join this project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Peter, Leah, and also Tess Fafun
for helping me throughout this project.
[SPEAKER_05]: To Mark Sorrell, and also David for
providing us with some resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to all GS group members for
constructive feedback and also great help
[SPEAKER_05]: in the field last summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: To Adrienne Undergrads, who helps us
during summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Lauren, who provided us with plant
materials and also some genotype data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to thank Fulbright for
funding my doctoral program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you and I'm happy to take any
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expected that the winter pea would be
more sensitive to the intercropping and
[SPEAKER_00]: what might be driving that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are expecting that to find accession
that not too sensitive to intercropping.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means that there's not much difference
between monocrop and intercrop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't need to establish a new
breeding program because we can use the
[SPEAKER_05]: monocrop scheme for intercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering, you had the pictures
of the peas physically growing on the oat
[SPEAKER_04]: stalks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering for that, is there any
kind of difficulty that would come across
[SPEAKER_04]: whenever you go to harvest that material?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, yes, actually there's some
challenging challenges in harvesting this
[SPEAKER_05]: because the pea tend to load.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to make sure that it's like
straight up before harvesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, yeah, there's couple
strategy before harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'll be talking about doing QTL
discovery in OP pollinated populations of
[SPEAKER_00]: apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Charlie said, I'm in the labs of
Dr. Awais Khan and Kelly Robbins.
So OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of an overview of this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about the motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do this in OP population and not just
traditional bi-parental populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also go over a few of the framework
I'm using for simulations to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of QTL mapping in OP populations
of apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do need to mention the role of
imputation and quality control as that is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to be, is apparent as being very
important in getting accurate QTL results
[SPEAKER_00]: in our market trade associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go over the results of our mapping
power, our false discovery rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our fine mapping resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll end with some takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, why open pollinated mapping in
apples?
[SPEAKER_00]: So logistically, it is difficult to make
bi-parental populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires obviously crossing in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with apples, there's quite a bit of
extra kind of logistical things to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind like flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number of flowers on the plant,
the amount of pollen that you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not uncommon to have to cross with
multiple different trees and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: even multiple different genotypes to get
the amount of seed required to produce an
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with an OP population, you would just
need to select a maternal plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: gather seed from that plant, and then
plant out your F1 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there's long generation
times that limit mapping population
[SPEAKER_00]: turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would go in tandem with an OP
mapping scheme where you could screen for
[SPEAKER_00]: a trait early on and not have to grow it
out to a full apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traits maybe like fruit quality
wouldn't be the best for this scheme
[SPEAKER_00]: because you would need to spend five or
six years cultivating the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would need to have the population to
screen for those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something like disease resistance or
anthocyanin content or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, research orchards provide a
diverse and already established source of
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apples are highly heterozygous and
don't grow true to type from their seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they must be maintained in an orchard
as that specific genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Cornell Agritech, most of the
research orchards have a couple hundred up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a hundred individual genotypes growing,
actively growing in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the germplasm
repository, which has 5,000 plus apples
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, apple trees that are already
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to utilize all of this
diversity all at once would give you a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: broader range of genetics to pull from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then OP populations capture natural
recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: They utilize this diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do detect a QTL, you can be
more sure that it's gonna be stable across
[SPEAKER_00]: a broader range of genetic backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just using a bi-parental
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my research, I'm using a population
that was developed at the germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: repository, which is seven full SID
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing that these populations
have in common is the maternal parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what is crucial for this OP
mapping scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seven malice aversi parents,
pollen donors, and one common seed parent
[SPEAKER_00]: of royal gala, which make seven distinct
full SID populations, but in aggregate is
[SPEAKER_00]: a half SID population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with OP mapping, if you do collect
from one tree, it is in an essence,
[SPEAKER_00]: just one half SID population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good proxy for studying how
to do QTL mapping in an OP population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, because we know the pollen
parents, it allows us to verify our
[SPEAKER_00]: results and kind of go further into the
analysis in how much does knowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen parent affect our ability to map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am using simulations to get these
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, what I'm using is that
same bi-parental dataset of the seven full
[SPEAKER_00]: SID population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I calculate a genomic relationship matrix
and set a QTL at a SNP that's segregating
[SPEAKER_00]: solely from the maternal parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I know that it's segregating
within the F1 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then simulate the phenotypes in that F1
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I mask the SNP by removing it
from the dataset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then use my model and reduce the
population size 15 times to look at how
[SPEAKER_00]: effective this OP mapping scheme would be
across population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do that 15 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then get market rate associations for
these 15 different population sizes and
[SPEAKER_00]: then repeat this process 40 times by
re-simulating phenotypes, all on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there are different
simulation parameters that I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two different genetic variances
of 0.8 and 0.5, with the background
[SPEAKER_00]: variance being also 0.2 and 0.5
respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the same heritability for
each scenario, which is 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm looking on two different linkage
groups with two different LD levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of separate recombination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one with a higher and one with a lower
recombination rate to see how that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficacy of the mapping in this F1
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the important detail about
knowing the parents is that I can then go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and compare the market rate
associations to the known QTL position and
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate power, fine mapping resolution,
and false discovery rate across these
[SPEAKER_00]: different population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we're finding out is that
imputation is very important in OP
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping, especially in Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GBS data can contain a high level of
missingness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imputation errors can lead to erroneous
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: High quality imputation improves detection
of QTL, I think especially both in Apples
[SPEAKER_00]: and this OP dataset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for highly heterozygous
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be having a bunch of
erroneous homozygous calls when,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, your QTL is on a heterozygous site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done is I've detected and
filtered impossible genotypes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: found in this bi-parental dataset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, there are the
eight parental genotypes, the seven
[SPEAKER_00]: subversi I, and then at the bottom is the
royal gala.
[SPEAKER_00]: The royal gala is heterozygous at this
particular locus, but all of the subversi
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollen donors are homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would guarantee that the QTL
is segregating from the royal gala seed
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the F1s, you see some
homozygous sites that have the allele that
[SPEAKER_00]: is only present in the heterozygous pollen
donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's likely due to genotyping errors,
so I must remove those sites and then
[SPEAKER_00]: impute those and keep checking back to see
if it's imputing them as being a site
[SPEAKER_00]: that's possible in this scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set those sites to missing,
impute using Beagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using Beagle to be agnostic to
parentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is also critical for
ensuring the reliability of my mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: results, because if you do have a site
segregating from this particular allele
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's overrepresented in the
population, your QTL mapping is not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be as accurate as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results I'm getting show that power
improves with QTL strength and population
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, there are blue and red lines
indicating the recombination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on which linkage group it is,
what the LB level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a higher recombination rate is in red,
a lower is in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the effect size of the QTL is
indicated by either a solid or dashed
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solid line would be a major trait
with a genetic variation explained of 0.8,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with dashed, it's the genetic
variation explained of 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see here is that higher
genetic variance means that you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower population size to get a higher
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the threshold I'm setting is 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to kind of be the case for
both high and lower recombination rates
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do get a higher power with a
higher genetic variance explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, larger population sizes and
stronger QTL reduce false positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the lower recombination
rate reduces the false positive rate with
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing population size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything does seem to kind of
converge around 500 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this and the last one, I used a two
megabase pair window around the causative
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP to define what a true positive would
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the OP mapping maintains acceptable
FDR with the proper design and proper
[SPEAKER_00]: population size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also resolution to the QTL
improves the genetic variance and
[SPEAKER_00]: population size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I measured the distance to the further
significant SNP from the causal QTL across
[SPEAKER_00]: all the simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these data points represent the
average of all of those 40 repetitions
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 15 data points per scenario
for the 15 different population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, it all converges around,
I'd say, 500 to 600 individuals with a
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution between one and two megabase
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a higher genetic variance and
larger populations equals a tighter QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the takeaways from this
analysis is that OP mapping is effective
[SPEAKER_00]: with sufficient sample size and marker
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power and resolution increase with QTL
effect and population size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imputation and genotype quality
control are essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some caveats to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I knew the parents, I was able to
see in the F1 population that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't know the parents, I wouldn't
be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at new methods to do this
kind of imputation without knowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, which could include haplotype
tracking or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has the potential for a scalable
framework for perennial crop genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd be able to collect a massive
amount of seed and produce a large F1
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having to do any crosses or go out
in the field and track flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how many flowers there are per
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect and store pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that there's overlap between
when you collect the pollen, when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to acknowledge my committee,
both of my labs, the Kahn and Robbins lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Agritech, the USDA germplasm
repository, and also the NSF NRT
[SPEAKER_00]: fellowship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will open up for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To what extent does flowering time,
like differences in flowering time,
[SPEAKER_03]: limit the diversity of the pollen parents
that end up getting pollinating in your
[SPEAKER_03]: diverse population?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not entirely sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're dealing with so many
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does mean is that we have to
go out every year and actually track when
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not on the same day every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of environmental
variation that can go into when a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: might, or when a tree might flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would completely eliminate the need
for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Jackson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever dealt with an impossible
genotype in your F1 population that was
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by your parental genotype reference
being incorrect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you repeat that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever dealt with an impossible
genotype in your F1 population that was
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by your parental genotype reference
being incorrect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I should look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the maternal heterozygous
genotype is called incorrectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: then at least with this simulation,
that throws everything off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the presentation, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You described the considerable benefits of
OP as opposed to making full SIBs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because making full SIBs is a lot of work,
sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the actual data set that you have,
somebody did that work seven times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of work went into this data set.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you know the answer to
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for your germplas, and I'm assuming
they're very diverged lineage-wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think there are any weird GBS
calls due to perhaps chromosomal
[SPEAKER_04]: differences?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so the GBS was done at around,
I think, between 4 and 6x depth for each
[SPEAKER_00]: of the subversive populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents were done at a higher depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that would be that much of
an issue in this particular case,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is coming from seven
subversive, which are more closely related
[SPEAKER_00]: than, say, looking at a orientalis and a
hybrid and a domestica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that would have caused
any of these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's likely due to the depth or
coverage of the GBS data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, David.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
