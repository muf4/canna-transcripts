[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are very rhythmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of skunk cabbage, of
jack-in-the-pulpit, your experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: much smaller versions of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Georgia O'Keeffe could have done this,
she would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this plant wasn't as popular during
her heyday as it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we were discussing before,
it's a little bit of a growth industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and botanical gardens around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've been telling my
colleagues in my own field is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: draw of this plant is not that other
flowers do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The draw of this plant is that it has a
hold on the human imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has charisma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fills rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have thousands of people
come see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outreach opportunity is not that
crop plants do this and honeybees like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outreach opportunity is that this is a
bigger-than-life example of what it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: for plants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Paul can show you the quorum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a literal investment in mass of
stored sun power as starch and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to marshal all that into this
unbelievable effort of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that it's gone after three
days is almost mythological to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're really interested in,
and I try to talk to students about,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the plant is almost behaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plant biology happens so slowly and
so under our noses that we think of them
[SPEAKER_00]: as passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this plant is doing is very
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing fast enough for you to see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come back every day and you see,
oh, OK, it's three inches taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's marshaling all this energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it blooms, this has been called in
the literature D-day because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible explosion of heat and stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the visual display, this spade
becomes a beautiful purple funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: William Bartholdt in Germany has actually
modeled with engineers the idea that it
[SPEAKER_00]: might actually be a convection chimney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this whole plant is strongly
thermogenic, it's heating up to 8 to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees centigrade above ambient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why on earth is it doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it doing it from sunset on D-day to
midnight, which is when it happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have thermal images from two years
ago showing beautifully in color coding
[SPEAKER_00]: how this thing gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the spade around it and
realize that the active part of the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: biology is down here in this little
chamber, these tiny little florets,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's doing is it's heating as it's
emitting scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the convection currents that would be
produced by that would actually carry that
[SPEAKER_00]: scent up into the forest canopy and away
from the forest floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a rain forest, it's a very stable
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rain forest understories don't have a lot
of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a Rafflesia flower in the same habitat
in tropical Asia, very large, very stinky,
[SPEAKER_00]: not as strongly heated or thermogenic,
the odor there would bleb off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary layer and diffuse along the
forest floor, where beetles and flies that
[SPEAKER_00]: come to dead animals would perceive it and
fly to the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of nice David
Attenborough footage of what happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: Rafflesia flowers in Borneo and Sumatra,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the German study was so why that was
so interesting to us was the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant may have a different niche
growing in the same forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be advertising to carry on
insects up at the canopy rather than down
[SPEAKER_00]: on the forest floor using physics,
basically creating a chimney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we've been
interested in is what's the schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they producing their blast of heat
and scent at dusk on D-Day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does that persist until midnight?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
