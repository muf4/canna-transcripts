[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be talking today about
how best opportunities aren't found.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, your career isn't put on a
silver platter for you, but rather they're
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the onus is on you to own your career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to empower you to have the
tools so that you can be successful no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter where you end up, whether it's in
academia or somewhere beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with a little challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the 1980s, the cumulative number of
faculty positions has remained relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: constant, as you can see in this orange
line at the bottom, whereas the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: PhDs awarded has been rising steadily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet unemployment for PhDs in the sciences
and engineering fields is less than the
[SPEAKER_00]: national average at about 4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does everybody end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Society for Cell Biology
brought together several sources to create
[SPEAKER_00]: this infographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For biology PhDs, that reveals a faculty
job is actually one of the alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: PhDs are successful in industry,
in government, in research science
[SPEAKER_00]: related, and non-science jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30% are estimated to not do a
postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 30% do a second postdoc for an
average nationally of about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers don't quite add up because
it's really hard to track information
[SPEAKER_00]: reliably on internationals or on all
postdocs in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these numbers were largely based on
the NIH Biomedical Workforce Working
[SPEAKER_00]: Group, which then identified an
opportunity to address this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they developed the best
awards for broadening experiences in
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific training.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to develop innovative
approaches that complement traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: research training in the biomedical
sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these awards were given to now 17
institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're experimental awards funded by the
NIH Common Fund Program Office,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is out of the office of the
director, Francis Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cornell is just one of the consortium
members that meet monthly via
[SPEAKER_00]: teleconference and several times a year in
person to share best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each institution has a different model
of how they run their best programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are working with small cohorts of 10
to 20 students a year, and they all go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the exact same programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, they get a best
certificate and they're ready for their
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Cornell, we have a very different
model where it's kind of a smorgasbord
[SPEAKER_00]: where you'll learn more about what we
offer, but it's much more inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some like Wayne State offer programming
that includes the humanities and social
[SPEAKER_00]: sciences as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell's best program is focused on
all STEM PhDs and postdocs, thanks to the
[SPEAKER_00]: additional support of the graduate school
and the colleges of Ag and Life Sciences,
[SPEAKER_00]: Arts and Sciences, Engineering,
Human Ecology, and Veterinary Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enhance opportunities to help trainees
prepare for their future careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for alumni, historically, what are
those careers, especially for life
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists like you at Cornell?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good news is they're virtually all
employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two to five years after PhD conferral,
about 30% are in postdocs and two thirds
[SPEAKER_00]: are employed in positions other than
postdoctoral training.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that percentage growing to 94% when
we survey Cornell alum, PhD alumni seven
[SPEAKER_00]: to 20 years out from their degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the types of employers
overall, other than in a postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: about half end up in the education sector,
in red here, and a third in the private
[SPEAKER_00]: sector, or this green part of the ring,
and about 10% end up in government.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we survey Cornell doctoral alumni,
44%, shown here in the blue, graph at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, seven to 20 years out from
their PhD report to be employed in four
[SPEAKER_00]: year colleges and universities or their
affiliated research institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a fifth are in industry,
but they're employed at nonprofits,
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign educational institutions,
the US government, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In green, you see alumni two to five years
post degree, when we're excluding the
[SPEAKER_00]: postdocs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest shift we see is in employment
in the industry sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see an increasing diversity in
other forms of employment, either they're
[SPEAKER_00]: self-employed, they're in foreign
governments, they're in medical schools or
[SPEAKER_00]: centers, they might be in K through 12
schools or community colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the types of employers
and we just focus on the education sector
[SPEAKER_00]: up here in red, the great majority are at
four year institutions, domestically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and about 17% are in a foreign educational
institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collectively, they are predominantly in
various stages of the tenure track
[SPEAKER_00]: process, as assistants, associates,
or full professors here in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: For alumni in the government sector,
here in gold, if we break it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the great majority, 71%,
are at the federal level domestically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe 22% in the non-US government,
with 6.5% ending up in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the industry and nonprofit
sector, the majority are in industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: 18% end up at nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this diversity of career outcomes
for Cornell alumni, it's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise that current PhDs and postdocs
are all interested in learning about all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best program focuses on four main
career tracks that fill the gap between
[SPEAKER_00]: the excellent existing support that's here
on campus for teaching excellence and
[SPEAKER_00]: academic research training, including
careers in science communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, if you want to become a
journal editor or a science writer or a
[SPEAKER_00]: museum director, for example, in science
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this encompasses both if you want to be
in creating policy to regulate science or
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other side, for scientists who
might want to contribute to the
[SPEAKER_00]: policymaking aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also governance risk and compliance,
for those who might consider becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: funding agency program officer or head of
biosafety or an intellectual property
[SPEAKER_00]: manager, and industry entrepreneurship and
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's overlap between a lot
of these buckets, and this is reflected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the interests of the best program
participants, which I'll share with you
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get involved and why are
people interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they get involved to become a bestie
first by going to our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fill out a short application about
what their career objectives are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We schedule an individual consultation to
personalize the program to your individual
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We invite you to come to events,
join the Cornell Best LinkedIn group,
[SPEAKER_00]: we even hired a photographer to come to
take a nice professional headshot if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to improve your LinkedIn profile
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work on an individual development
plan, either start one or if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already got one, maybe it's a good time to
review that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key point is to include your
professor, your advisors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations that you're having about
your plans so that that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished alongside of your research
objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you know about your own values
and where you'd like to explore,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better we can tailor the program to
your individual needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So self-exploration really is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the application, besties express
the most interest in industry
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurship and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a big bucket too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here at the bottom, you see 28% have
checked that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a large proportion are interested in a
combination often involving science
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many just want to learn about all the
different tracks to see what career
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities are geared toward PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two thirds of the applicants are
actually in the life sciences with about a
[SPEAKER_00]: third also in the physical sciences and we
have open door programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often have people from the social
sciences and humanities join us as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though that's not our focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come from over 60 departments
across campus and fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of our most active trainees compared
to campus totals, proportionally fewer are
[SPEAKER_00]: post-docs probably because if they come to
a research one institution, they probably
[SPEAKER_00]: want to become a tenure track academic
professor and are set on their training
[SPEAKER_00]: and proportionally more self-identifies
underrepresented minorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our reach, as I said, really extends
beyond doctoral students, which are our
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are the focus of our program and
post-docs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often have master students,
undergrads and other people like staff and
[SPEAKER_00]: faculty attend our programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: By college, we have participation across
the disciplines with 40% coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, 30% roughly from CALS and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the different sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some hallmarks, and now that you know a
little bit about our participants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of want to tell you what our
program actually offers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually begin by reminding everyone
that your primary objective is really to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a successful PhD, concentrate on your
research and your publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to distract you from that
most important job you have here as a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctoral student or a post-doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with that in mind, we don't have
any fixed requirements because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're busy and we're ready for you all to
take advantage of the program that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's convenient for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're right before your thesis
writing or before your A exam,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't recommend you participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll catch you up at a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aside from filling out our application,
which takes about 10 minutes, you can come
[SPEAKER_00]: to any events by choice, meet with program
staff to learn how the program could be
[SPEAKER_00]: customized to your individual needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you're a first year grad
student or a month away from the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: your postdoc, you can come join in and
tangibly benefit from the professional
[SPEAKER_00]: development resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of our participants haven't really
thought yet about considering anything
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond academia or unfamiliar with the
many options available to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this stage, we provide exposure to
the variety of career outcomes to which
[SPEAKER_00]: PhDs are well suited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We share resources for specific
information to learn more about the skills
[SPEAKER_00]: needed in a particular career path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we guide activities that'll help rule
in or rule out because we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: agnostic as to what the career outcome is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help you rule in or rule out a
particular option to help decide whether
[SPEAKER_00]: the pros and cons mesh with your
individual objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this stage, you might want to come
to a career panel discussion on science
[SPEAKER_00]: communication or other areas to hear how
recent alumni have transitioned from
[SPEAKER_00]: academia and what they like most and least
about their jobs or about how they got
[SPEAKER_00]: there, what their path was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear their perspectives firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we often have experienced managers
share what they most value in new PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: hires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a chance for you to broaden your
network, not just with alumni,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with like-minded colleagues from
across campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In different disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to go to, for instance,
an advancing science and policy club
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting to learn more about what's
involved in connecting with policymaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've designed special gap-filling courses
and workshops to address needs that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: covered on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, we have created what
started out as a workshop as a business as
[SPEAKER_00]: a second language.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now a full-blown course called
Business and Management Fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can learn more about the business
side of science, which might help you in
[SPEAKER_00]: academia as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we encourage you to get involved by
going to our website, sign up for a lift
[SPEAKER_00]: serve, take the time to learn how we can
be used as a springboard for other
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that are available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just a matter of learning
about where those resources exist because
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't reinvent programming for teaching
or for entrepreneurship for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those resources are really well
developed across campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key point of our program is really
that it's more about doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to apply what you learn and
write it on your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can help design and empower you to
create an experience that's customized to
[SPEAKER_00]: your needs and might help others along the
way who have similar interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that these experiences result
in a rule in or rule out, that's okay too,
[SPEAKER_00]: decision and end up having you actively
acquire the skills that will set your
[SPEAKER_00]: resume apart from all the other PhD
applicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second level of participation for
those who maybe they're post A exam or
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a little more time, we can help
plan to prioritize more experiential
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to try on the particular
career, learn firsthand whether it suits
[SPEAKER_00]: you and to learn how to describe your
research in a way that will resonate with
[SPEAKER_00]: the future employer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope that each experience results in
something you can write on your resume to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, not only am I interested in science
communication, but here's the lay article
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote or here's the blog I started or
here's the op-ed piece that I contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to affect policy or something along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to be able to say,
okay, I've done that and then use that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience when you're in an interview
situation to show that you have drawn from
[SPEAKER_00]: experience rather than theoretical
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already mentioned some courses you can
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are over 70 courses across
Cornell in entrepreneurship alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our besties is actually TAing the
technology commercialization course that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you if you're interested in
that area to sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we curate actually probably the eight
or 10 entrepreneurial courses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: open to PhDs and postdocs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They welcome scientists and engineers in
their classes to mingle with business
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can save you some time in
perusing big long lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have offered certificates in lean Six
Sigma thinking, in biopharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory affairs, in good clinical
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have a certificate on your
resume that shows not just that you're an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert in FDA regulations, but at least
you're taking the active steps to say you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to become more aware of the
regulatory path in industry, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people have entered business
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've participated in the three minute
thesis competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've successfully applied for internal
seed grants, either through the Center for
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced Technology, through statewide
clean energy grants, or even through
[SPEAKER_00]: federal programs for small business
innovation research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two company startups already from
besties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people invite speakers to
symposium like Eric did today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can be recommended, I'm sorry,
to be a speaker at an industry conference
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself or moderate a career panel that
the best program puts on to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many have gone on to either shape New York
legislation to have their policy brief
[SPEAKER_00]: included in the clean energy bill passed
by the New York State Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to think creatively and
flexibly about internship experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call them best internships because
we want to get out of the mindset of what
[SPEAKER_00]: an internship is that's typically 10 to 12
weeks full time over the summer for an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: PhDs can really add value over a longer
term, maybe perhaps remotely, and using
[SPEAKER_00]: the research skills that you're developing
during your thesis work or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoctoral work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So key findings are that we want to be
flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, if you want to stay in
the lab and don't want to travel off
[SPEAKER_00]: campus, there are many existing
opportunities within Cornell, for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance, in the environmental health and
safety unit or in the licensing office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had besties embedded there where
they're on site sometimes, but when they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lab experiment to go, they go back
to the lab and they contribute remotely in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own time, doing market research,
doing lab inspections as a bioscience or a
[SPEAKER_00]: safety officer, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had people arrange with their
advisors to work off campus two days a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, at a venture capital
investment firm, XL Partners, to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: venture analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an unusual path,
but it was personalized for this
[SPEAKER_00]: individual's career goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had ones who worked developing their
own technology with a startup firm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Binghamton to implement their research at
a food science company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had ones who have used the time
between their thesis defense and their
[SPEAKER_00]: actual degree conferral to do a real
internship, a more classical internship,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person happened to be from
Luxembourg and is now fully employed at
[SPEAKER_00]: Bain as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a way not only for the company
to check out his experience, but also for
[SPEAKER_00]: him to interview the company to see if
that's really where he wanted to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had students participate longer term
with their advisors' consent and approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, at a strategic analysis firm
in Washington, DC, where this student
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the regulations and perceptions
around gain of function studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: affected the moratorium on pathogenic
organism research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that work, the
moratorium was lifted and he contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have actually spent greater amounts
of time at a large pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not usual, but this is to express
the range of possibilities that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have successfully done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this student just completed his PhD
and realized that maybe he doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to that biopharma company is going to
be working at another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes unexpected outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, better you do that now
while you're doing your PhD and you might
[SPEAKER_00]: save yourself some time later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to start to change the
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We build on existing seminar series to get
a captive audience in the room to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage students to suggest speakers
who come from beyond academia to come and
[SPEAKER_00]: speak within their seminar series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, the BEST program
will fund half the cost of the travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a nice incentive for
departments to be open to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll share a few example outcomes
created by BEST trainees, not to say this
[SPEAKER_00]: is what we do, but to get the creative
juices flowing so that you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired for what you might want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for industry, entrepreneurship and
management, the BEST program funded a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc to attend a pre-seed workshop,
which happened to be happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Rochester because his technology was ready
earlier than the pre-seed workshop that
[SPEAKER_00]: was happening here on campus to evaluate
the commercial potential of his cleantech
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pre-seed workshop is a team
oriented handpicked team that is made up
[SPEAKER_00]: of a tech transfer officer, a licensing
executive, a seasoned entrepreneur,
[SPEAKER_00]: a facilitator and coach to walk them
through the 20 questions they need to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: before investing another 10,000 hours to
see if that technology is worth
[SPEAKER_00]: commercializing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, only one of those
questions concerns the technological
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important for that idea to go
forward to really consider, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is anybody going to buy the product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it solve any problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the competitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to set up your team?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to get your funding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of BEST referrals and
networking at this pre-seed workshop,
[SPEAKER_00]: this postdoc actually assembled a business
team to compliment his scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together they applied for and were
awarded a New York state energy grant to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to their first 40 potential customers
and get feedback before they even develop
[SPEAKER_00]: their prototype to see whether it would be
worthwhile moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided, yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an equally good outcome would have
been, no, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also a success in our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually started the company and
they're calling it Eco Electro and have
[SPEAKER_00]: since won a small business innovation
research grant to move forward on this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now full time with the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's his path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So key elements of these stories are
always that it includes good mentoring and
[SPEAKER_00]: your advisor might not be your only
mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times faculty are here because they
love academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And might not have experience in other
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to connect you with multiple
mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little S at the end here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the field of your career aspiration
who might meet with you regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you to stay on track and help
you succeed in your career of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should note that we do not assign
mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a process where you have a
good chemistry with someone who gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't want to interfere with
your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the science policy track,
which is spearheaded by Chris Schaeffer,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's the COPE principal investigator on
this best grant, he actually took a
[SPEAKER_00]: sabbatical year to be a science and
technology policy fellow himself in
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Markey's office and came back with
the message that scientists and engineers
[SPEAKER_00]: are by far the worst storytellers ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he developed a course called the
Science Policy Bootcamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: From concept to conclusion, which now has
had several, it's a team oriented class
[SPEAKER_00]: that has had several iterations now where
there are tangible projects where teams
[SPEAKER_00]: from different areas of scientific and
non-scientific disciplines get together to
[SPEAKER_00]: create an outcome that will address their
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, there were a couple of
students who thought that it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to teach algorithmic thinking
early on, not in the first coding class
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get as an undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they developed with a local
elementary school principal, they
[SPEAKER_00]: developed a grant, got outside funding and
deployed this code for kids program to 120
[SPEAKER_00]: second through sixth graders to improve
their algorithmic thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're making a difference locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group, I mentioned the Advancing
Science and Policy graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: organization has developed a bring a
politician to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've already had several sessions
where they invited Ithaca Mayor Svante
[SPEAKER_00]: Myrick to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They toured various labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he is in a child cognition lab in
Maria Casasola's lab where actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: child was teaching him how to do the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a fun event.
[SPEAKER_00]: He toured several other labs including an
imaging lab and so on and then had a group
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion with grad students and postdocs
who might be interested in seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians actually get their scientific
information to inform their policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had Barbara Lifton come in and she
also did the same kind of thing where she
[SPEAKER_00]: toured several labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great way to hear firsthand how
you can describe your research to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who might have last had math in high
school, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different way of thinking about
how you describe your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these aspects of communication will
help you if you're going to teach an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate class or if you're going to
mentor another postdoc in your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the science communication area,
we've had an example where a best trainee
[SPEAKER_00]: was paired with a science communication
professional to hone her skills in writing
[SPEAKER_00]: a press release.
[SPEAKER_00]: She learned how to conduct interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's really hard to get
scientists and engineers to talk cogently
[SPEAKER_00]: about their research in a way that's going
to interest the broader public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she actually worked on the structure
and mechanics of writing a piece like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which is very different from a
scientific paper, but she also learned
[SPEAKER_00]: about the editing process as she sent in
her article to the Chronicle and had
[SPEAKER_00]: several articles published.
[SPEAKER_00]: She helped co-organize with a team of
other people, CompSciCon, a communicating
[SPEAKER_00]: science conference, which now is in its
third year at Cornell, entirely student
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learn all about event planning and
rallying the resources needed and
[SPEAKER_00]: proselytizing about a grand idea that you
might want to move your agenda forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not unlike what faculty do
every day when they have new ideas they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's actually in a communication role.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's about to start that role now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lessons learned are that flexibility
and customization is essential,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very hard to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our problem, but it's a good
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think, sorry, this should be faculty
buy-in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faculty buy-in is very important,
and we want you to have conversations with
[SPEAKER_00]: your advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might just have a perception that
they're not receptive to you going into
[SPEAKER_00]: another career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our programming assessment really helps
prune less successful ideas, and we always
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the evaluations to help inform
future participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've stopped doing things altogether
when we've had bad reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for filling out any surveys that
you might have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we emphasize a primary objective
is to complete your degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do meet with faculty as needed to
address questions, perceptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do discontinue best privileges if
we hear that there's been inadequate
[SPEAKER_00]: academic progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collaborate very heavily across units
because we're a very small office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have connections in the graduate
school, career services, alumni affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work closely with the Office of
Postdoctoral Studies and various student
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations and professional
organizations on and off campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we try to identify gaps and
coordinate to fill those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best is not for everyone, and that's
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like to concentrate on sharing the
positive message and not express a doom
[SPEAKER_00]: and gloom attitude of how difficult it is
to get one particular career or another,
[SPEAKER_00]: because frankly, any career you go into,
you have to be passionate, and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be willing to work hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of our message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an advisory board that's made up
exclusively of grad students and postdocs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're really integral in shaping our
program and in events and planning and
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach to other participants across
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're an adaptable program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our vision and components are flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some challenges in evaluation
because the NIH is very concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: time to degree, which might or might not
be the right question to ask, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: think that if you spend two months,
let's say, in an internship and find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe you don't need to do it three
or postdoc, you will have saved some time
[SPEAKER_00]: long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to engage in those
conversations, whether they're politically
[SPEAKER_00]: correct right now or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very inclusive, and we would like to
imagine persisting outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in now our fourth year of a
five-year grant, so we have two more years
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of that, we're expected to
be institutionalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best of our best practices,
we hope, will be incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have courses that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a physics course on science
communication that incorporates theatrical
[SPEAKER_00]: and performing arts aspects into how you
engage your audience in those first 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes of your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've developed workshops and certificate
programs that are continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We involve PhDs in programs that,
prior to the best program involvement,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were not eligible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, internships at small life
sciences companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope to be developing a new
paradigm for PhD training, whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: previously, it was thought that your
faculty member should mentor you
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout your PhD, which would,
of course, lead to a postdoc and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: an academic career, unless you kind of
fell by the wayside somewhere else and
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up finding your own way in some
other career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, the consortium, which has
published this in the FASEP Journal just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years ago, would like to think more
about your scientific and research
[SPEAKER_00]: training to incorporate career and
professional development throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: time that you're doing your PhD,
such that you can decide whether a postdoc
[SPEAKER_00]: is good for you or not, and to help you be
successful in any career that you decide
[SPEAKER_00]: to pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, we have researchers on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Roach is in the Dyson School,
and he partnered with Henry Sauerman to
[SPEAKER_00]: publish this science paper recently that
actually showed that, yes, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: into an academic career as a tenure track
professor, you probably will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc and you'll need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're going into an industry
career or into an academic non-research
[SPEAKER_00]: position, actually, it might be a
financial loss to you if you want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into that career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you should really think about that
and think carefully about the skills you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to acquire during your postdoc,
such that they will get you better
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for where you want to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the career aspirations of our
best trainees?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we compare when you began your PhD
in the light gray here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority think they want to become
tenure track faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they haven't even thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just assumed that was where they
wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we ask them, how about now,
we find the biggest shift is in other
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, such as consulting,
entrepreneurship, and communication
[SPEAKER_00]: careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope to empower you to own your own
career and to be successful wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the principal investigator
of the grant, Avery August.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a faculty member in immunology and
infectious disease in the vet school.
[SPEAKER_00]: The co-PI is John Parker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in virology at the Baker Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the co-PI, I mentioned Chris Schaefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a professor in biomedical
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Suzy Varvianis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please contact me if you'd like to
have more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll entertain questions, both from here
and from Geneva, if there are any.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that there wasn't a category for
PhD students going on to medical school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that come up often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is tracking of Cornell alumni
that go on to further degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consider that still in training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they go to medical school or law
school, for instance, or they go on for
[SPEAKER_00]: another master's, let's say, in public
health after their PhD, we didn't include
[SPEAKER_00]: those statistics in the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, we have examples of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you go back one slide, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe two slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people that go into the non-tenure
track faculty jobs that don't have a PhD,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do they fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, if you go on to a
non-tenure track position that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: in academia, presumably, where are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all the other jobs that people
have gone into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be in academic research
still, or they might be a core facility
[SPEAKER_00]: director.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have PhDs here at Cornell who
run the genomics facilities, imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people without PhDs, we have not
tracked them here because our program is
[SPEAKER_00]: dictated by the NIH to focus on PhD
recipients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because many people, like me, leave with
their masters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have fulfilling careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, master's programs,
or people who exit with their masters from
[SPEAKER_00]: a PhD program, so that the master's degree
programs usually are well-served in their
[SPEAKER_00]: career objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, on day one, they're told to go to
the career fair, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a compressed timeline,
and it's very job-oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who decide, they started with a PhD
program and decided to leave with a
[SPEAKER_00]: master's, that's a different situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have counseled some in that category
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have gone on to successful industry
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realize they didn't need a PhD for
where they wanted to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them end up coming back for a PhD
after working for a while because they
[SPEAKER_00]: realize there's a ceiling for master's
students or master's degree recipients in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field that they want to go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have ended up in public policy and
are working on maternal health,
[SPEAKER_00]: fetal nutritional health, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have the statistics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could look into those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you look at... So that's an individual
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make a blanket statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It obviously depends on your field and
where you want to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as many people see, you will get paid
much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might, just as the question about
having a postdoc is necessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a PhD necessary, is also a question you
should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we encourage people to make that
thought before they enroll into the PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't given thought to that,
it's an important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's important to talk to
people who are in the field that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I counseled the person who was leaving
with their master's.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very happily as a process engineer
at Pfizer right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she chose to leave with her master's
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I connected her with people who either
did have their PhD or did not have their
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she could have a comparison of what
both the salary level and the advancement
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are for that degree outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have sort of two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, and I think you might have
mentioned this, but one of the areas that
[SPEAKER_02]: was missing is sort of teaching,
but at either a four-year liberal arts
[SPEAKER_02]: college, they're not as much
research-focused, or also at a community
[SPEAKER_02]: college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an area for students that decide
they want to go into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that even though we are in
academia, it's a very different thing
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the research versus having a really
strong, concentrated teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is on how about
teaching-focused careers, either if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go to a community college or a K
through 12 environment or at a four-year
[SPEAKER_00]: liberal arts college.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, our program doesn't cover
teaching at all because we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent Center for Teaching Excellence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have CU CERTL, which is part of
like a 48 institution consortium that
[SPEAKER_00]: provides information about teaching and
academic careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I brought their brochures today
because I think it's a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: career outcome to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we work very closely with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a great academic job search
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mentoring series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to flip the classroom and use
other teaching techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other question is funding for best
internships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an ongoing discussion for all
our consortium because there are different
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for large companies, usually they will
pay for the person to do an internship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are certain international
students due to visa restrictions that
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case, that was actually one of
the on-campus best internships that we
[SPEAKER_00]: arranged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they worked in the licensing office,
but actually weren't paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got that experience anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's almost every possible
combination you can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: To address how they address the tuition
payments and enrollment situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's done on an individual basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to make a blanket
statement about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been departments on campus that
created a course called Internships and
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiential Opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as it's offered to all
students, not just international students,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not seen as a way to get around
federal rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been an option at some
universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to adhere to the Fair Labor
Standards Act, which means if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: adding value, you must get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to address the perception that
grad students and postdocs should not
[SPEAKER_00]: shortchange themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't undersell themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably shouldn't volunteer for an
unpaid internship unless it's really for
[SPEAKER_00]: their training and the only way they can
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are ways of showing the
value that you're going to add to a
[SPEAKER_00]: company or even a small institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are non-profits which have zero
money to be able to pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case, sometimes there are
creative ways, I don't want to say to
[SPEAKER_00]: launder money, but to circulate the funds
such that we can reimburse the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, for their training time or for
the consulting that the student does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pay for travel and accommodations
if they go to a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they don't get paid per se while
there, but there's some mitigation that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make so that it's more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have taken leaves of absence
and others just do it on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a smorgasbord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the question was about whether the best
internships are prearranged or whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's up to the trainee to find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes a faculty member has one of
their students who went off and started a
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting company and they just got an
SBIR grant and they're looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: trainee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that student got that
policymaking job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent it to me and I send it out and
say, hey, who's interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply and then they were accepted for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, it's the trainee and the best
fit is gonna be when you create yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your career field
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the most meaningful interactions
will be those that you've found yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or created yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to make that easier, we do have a
list of all the biopharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have formal internship
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can click once and get right to
their internships and jobs page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try and save you some time in doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have as big a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a list of all the major think
tanks, for instance, or we have a list of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the professional societies that maybe
you wanna become more involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytopathological society to arrange a
student symposium on career development or
[SPEAKER_00]: communication or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try and create those links to make
it a little bit easier for you to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: own homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Geneva has any questions, the thing is
I can't hear them so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do actually have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, just came up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we wanted to, would it best come up to
Geneva to do presentations or things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that if we had enough students to
participate up here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on the other end, is there a way to,
when you bring in speakers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: presenting down on main campus,
are they in rooms that are compatible with
[SPEAKER_01]: this system so that we can conference them
into us up here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, to answer your first question,
just invite me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to answer your second question,
we would need a student who's enterprising
[SPEAKER_00]: to set up that connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could, if you have the rooms,
then we could create that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say if we wanted to have a
speaker in here, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's willing to provide the
technology to connect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we wanna include you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll send you an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question, as I understand,
is on how the word gets around about the
[SPEAKER_00]: best programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have allies in different units or
how does the word get around?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be honest, when I took this
position, we had a cohort model where I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I could handle about 50 or 60
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on our first executive board meeting,
we changed our vision and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be open to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have about 350, 60, but we touch
over 1,100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bandwidth is low for doing active
marketing, but that's why I have an
[SPEAKER_00]: advisory board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our advisory board has members from 10
different fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the word of mouth gets around to
those fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a listserv where anybody could
join.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also often email the graduate field
assistants and DGSs for each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our program started focused in the
biomedical fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's STEM wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've done some outreach to faculty
department meetings, which is how this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done road shows to those existing
faculty meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a website that we hope people
will go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our target predominantly has been grad
students and postdocs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we advertise in the postdoctoral
newsletter, in the graduate school
[SPEAKER_00]: announcements, and other things where grad
students and postdocs hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still people who never hear
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a challenge at Cornell
in general about how to communicate all
[SPEAKER_00]: the fabulous resources that are at
everyone's disposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm kind of thinking about what
happens after in this stage of
[SPEAKER_02]: institutionalizing the gains that you've
made and whether you would have sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: formal connections to individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like SIPs, for example, which is a
third of the college of ag and life
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences that would persist after there's
not the current grant and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the ground point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is about
institutionalization, how the program will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue beyond the life of our grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm working on that end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll also be looking at the next
opportunity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what I do 100% of my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we write support letters for grants
where perhaps a portion of the training
[SPEAKER_00]: would be done through the best program and
then supported on the grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a proposal into the graduate
school who's working with the provost and
[SPEAKER_00]: chief financial officer to see what can be
done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are ongoing discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, other consortium members have
different models for that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them have a give button right on
their best site where alumni can donate to
[SPEAKER_00]: their program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they work with an industry organization
to hopefully have a New Jersey bio fund
[SPEAKER_00]: internships for graduate students and
postdocs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has kind of a different
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wayne State, the PI happens to be the
dean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she just takes it out of her dean
pocket and gives it to the best program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're different models that are
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it might be a combination of
all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be that we concentrate our
efforts and reduce our offerings to the
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where we're making the most
difference, which is why our evaluations
[SPEAKER_00]: are so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, everyone, for coming
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more questions, absolutely
