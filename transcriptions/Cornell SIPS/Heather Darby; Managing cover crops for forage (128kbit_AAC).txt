[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you're enjoying the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really wonderful and a lot to
learn and take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Tom, Kilser, and I are the only
two in this session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be talking about
managing cover crops for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, at least I believe Tom and
I are both, in some ways, talking most
[SPEAKER_00]: about feeding cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you may have questions about
other livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we can answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe someone else here in this room
can answer those questions, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told Tom I would try to give an
introduction to what he was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I feel like really
helped cover crops take off pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let's rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once people realized, well,
once people started cover cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: finally, after how many years we kept
trying to get them to do it, Sandra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once people realize that they
could also actually use those cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: as a feed source, you know, the adoption
rate really skyrocketed for us anyway in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not, you know, some of the work
that Tom did that we've done as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: people really started to look at cover
crops as more than a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that cover crops aren't important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, many of the farmers
we work with feed and making sure you have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough feed and high quality feed to feed
those animals that are producing the milk
[SPEAKER_00]: or the meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's your top priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really everything else comes after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though all the other components,
managing the soil, all these things are
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously critical to getting high quality
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything sort of stops at
making sure those cows can give milk,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at least in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, selling cover crops has been
a difficult, you know, sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, once people realize that there
was an opportunity to gain more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: a pat on the back, things really took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally worked with a number of
organic dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about grazing a little bit
and Tom will talk more about stored feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally saw a lot of organic dairy
farmers in particular, starting to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops as they were thinking about
rotations to actually extend their grazing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I really started to think
about, boy, maybe we could get all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: other dairy farms to think about this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we've heard enough about all
the great things that cover crops do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to spend my time talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that we saw early on
when we first started looking at double
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping, John Jemison and I and a few
others from the University of Maine had
[SPEAKER_00]: this project funded through the IPM Center
to look at double cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was in, oh jeez, like 2009 or
2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the same in conventional
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really saw was one of the benefits
to doing it was just reduced weed
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot less weeds in the corn
following a harvest of a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a real benefit on top of
the soil quality benefits, on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that people were getting feed,
especially in an organic system,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a lot less weed pressure was
another major benefit to this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to how we're working with farmers
on thinking about cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I feel like we still
have a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when a farmer starts thinking about
growing crops, he doesn't start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that the day he goes out with his
planter or his harvester.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's thinking about that and planning for
that all the time through the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just something like, I'll have
time to make that feed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really planning this whole system
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really want farmers to do is
actually plan for cover cropping well
[SPEAKER_00]: before the time that they actually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're thinking about
using cover crops for feed, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: plan for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they really need to be planted at
a certain time at the right seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of cover crop you may choose will
change depending on what you're feeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: when you want to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide programs, the maturity of your
corn, these are all things that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to plan for to be able to harvest a cover
crop for feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really looking at the entire year
and planning that out and having cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops be an actual part of your crop plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for those of us that are researchers,
scientists, working, whatever we're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this seems like something that we would
just do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really hasn't been that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops have not actually been a part
of somebody's cropping plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're continuing to encourage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we're more successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first pieces that we've been
trying to consider for many years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost feel like a broken record,
but you're a new audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you haven't heard me say this before,
is that we've been really trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to grow shorter season corn,
to be able to get those cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: planted more timely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's been a really hard sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed a lot over the last 10 years
since I started talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are shifting away from really long
season corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've collected the same data for 14
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is true that the relative maturity
of the corn is not a good indicator of top
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That a short season corn can often
outperform a long season corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really more dependent upon
variety selection and less dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: the relative maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the value of having university
corn variety trial experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cornell, I know, just started doing
theirs again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're partnering with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really being able to see a lot of
different varieties across a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different maturities is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we not only want the farmer to
choose a 98 day relative maturity variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we want them to choose the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the yield is as high as that 108
day variety that they used to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why do we want farmers to plant
shorter season corn?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they harvest it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to plant the cover crop
at the time that's best for the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you're growing it for feed or
just as a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a cover crop, timing of planting is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is data from Vermont compiled
over many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the relative maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the planting dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to plant the longer season
corn a bit earlier than the shorter season
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see when we're planting corn,
it's kind of in this 80 day range to early
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 day range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be harvesting that in most years in
early September.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us plenty of time to get a
cover crop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe more time than the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say more time than they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even planting these, what we would
call in Vermont mid season varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: buys us enough time to get a good cover
crop established.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get into these late maturing
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in Vermont, we were
harvesting corn into November this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finished chopping I think like two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were very late season varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in most years, you really want to be
getting your corn chopped by this time and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that cover crop in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really been promoting shortening
that maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Tom will talk about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then just average if we average
the harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 92 to 98 day corn on average is harvest
around mid September, where 102 to 108 day
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Vermont, again, is closer to
the end of September into October in most
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing we're really trying to
get people to focus on is planning date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you really want to have
a nice stand of forage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure it's planted timely
so that it has time to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit tiller and produce a lot of biomass
the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done years of planning date
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see dry matter yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the following year when this is
winter rye is planted at different dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can maximize dry matter yield the
second year by planting earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is something a lot of people
observe but don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that small grains tiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have one plant and then from that
one seed, they make multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can observe this in the field when
you plant a winter rye cover crop and you
[SPEAKER_00]: see those single spikelets come out of the
ground and then you go back, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, two, three weeks later,
probably three weeks later, a month later,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see the whole areas filled in,
you don't see bare ground anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you plant too late, if you're
planting in October, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what ends up happening is you just
see those spikelets and you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, I have a really thin stand this year
because it didn't have enough time to
[SPEAKER_00]: tiller and actually fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's bad from an environmental
perspective, but also from a forage
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, because if you don't get any
tillering, you have a lot less yield the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of the importance of
planting timely so that you can reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeding rate for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make up for that by getting more
tillering and then more yield the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, you have better
ground cover, more root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those positive benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tillering can account for almost 60% of
the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only going to tiller if it's
planted timely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to get the corn harvested,
get the cover crop on on time and give it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time to actually grow and tiller
and fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeding rate, we've had this
conversation over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've gone up on seeding rates,
down on seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, if we're planning for forage,
we do tend to plant at higher seeding
[SPEAKER_00]: rates than if we're just cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Vermont, you know, we recommend at
this point, I think we're at 75 pounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandra, if it's seeded on time,
because at 75 pounds, really, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: get enough tiller ring to fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often, many of our farmers will bump
those seeding rates up to get more biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're trying to kill that cover
crop through tillage next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you likely don't want all of that biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense to have a slightly lower
seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to maximize biomass,
you may want to increase that seeding
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, make sure it's planted on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a good forage stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you start thinking about this as a
forage and not just a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, a lot of people don't put as much
effort into their cover crops as they
[SPEAKER_00]: should.
[SPEAKER_00]: People put a lot of effort into growing
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do is get
people to put as much effort into this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop as they do their other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also winter barley, but that's not
quite as common because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: overwinter very well in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably does here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most farmers are growing rye,
triticale or wheat as a forage crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that I want you to notice is
dry matter yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dry matter yields and time harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter rye, we were getting about two
tons of yield and this was harvested in
[SPEAKER_00]: the boot stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was harvested the 23rd of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to plant corn after
this, I think most farmers want that to
[SPEAKER_00]: come off as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that then they can go in and plant
their corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see for us triticale was about
a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then wheat was right around the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Tom saw opposite of what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw lower yields with wheat,
I think you said, and higher yields with
[SPEAKER_00]: the other crops, but whatever variety we
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a forage wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't remember the exact variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see Sarah here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She worked on the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samantha here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, she's not here either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, just really, I think for most
farmers, this is what's really important
[SPEAKER_00]: to them as well as the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being able to get it off timely
enough, have enough time to get the corn
[SPEAKER_00]: crop in or whatever other crop they may be
growing after that may not be corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe soybeans, maybe something else.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety selection is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some other types of grains that we
looked at and also varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Huron rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a variety not stated triticale,
tricale 099, 141.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a winter barley and then two types
of wheat and spelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see the difference in yields
from the different forage types and
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I think the important thing for
many farmers here is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When are we harvesting this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our Huron rye, that was harvested
about the same time as this triticale
[SPEAKER_00]: variety not stated, again, right around
the third week of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything else was after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what was really interesting is
that these different triticale varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: are heading out at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just like we select varieties of
corn, if we're going to grow some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different cover crops for feed,
then managing variety selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, will become really important,
especially if we're trying to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: feed harvested by the third week of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to pick a late season
triticale to plant and end up not
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting until June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see spelt with much
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this year, wheat was laid as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would have all been planted like
third week of September in the fall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the interesting thing
is that when they're harvested early,
[SPEAKER_00]: so whether it's grazed or really probably
up to the boot stage, we don't see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of difference between species and also
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as they begin to mature more,
those varietal differences and also
[SPEAKER_00]: species differences really start to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But early on, they don't show as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen management, Tom will talk
about this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we do see a response to
fertilizing these winter forages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, and I think just to take
home messages, would you grow any other
[SPEAKER_00]: crop without considering its nutrient
needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, that's what you need to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we'll see a yield response
from adding additional nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what you need to do is figure
out what its nutrient needs are and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand if you're meeting those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, basically, what we do for the
most part is plant the cover crop and hope
[SPEAKER_00]: it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing it as a crop,
you have a very different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't just throw a crop out
there without even thinking about what it
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's no different with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was spring applied.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we generally see is if there's no
manure addition to the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: With manure, whether or not you need
additional fertility, that depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Tom will talk about that more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start growing two crops in a
season, you need to be thinking about what
[SPEAKER_00]: those two crops need, not just your main
season crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see farmers get into trouble with
this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're double cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the crop nitrogen removal rate for
just a standard double crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at an end removal rate
almost over $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people are only fertilizing for
their corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ends up happening is this cereal
is taking out almost 100 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what ends up happening is their
corn needs a lot more to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they haven't planned for that,
they can run into a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caught a lot of people by surprise,
where they'll take a PSNT and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: back the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's twice what they would normally
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a benefit or not growing this as a
feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Tom will talk about the
economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is stage of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative, food, milk, soft dough,
different times that you can harvest the
[SPEAKER_00]: forage, all with different quality
analysis and all with different yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, when you choose to harvest
this completely in your ball court as a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need heifer feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather wasn't any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ended up here instead of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Tom just mentioned, stage of
harvest has more impact on quality than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is net energy of lactation for
the different harvest stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you give me a five minute already and
I didn't see you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, don't be so subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is vegetative NELs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's highest with the
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to move down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into the milk stage,
it's actually the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it begins to go up again as you
get to the soft dough stage, because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making energy at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the worst time really to harvest is in
the milk stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'll just touch on grazing a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of studies looking at
grazing winter forages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in West Swanton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see cows have grazed this
versus not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see they just really like to
trim off the top leafy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen over the years of doing
this work is that it's a nice way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the cows out onto pasture one to two weeks
before you would put them out on standard
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial forage pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this obviously is dependent on the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the study that we conducted in West
Swanton, you can see we almost had a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of dry matter by the 3rd of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this farm doesn't normally put their
cows out to pasture until about the 14th,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15th of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we got off the pasture,
that first graze was a small fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we had from grazing the cool season
forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before they even put the cows out on
their normal pasture, they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get about a ton of dry matter and then
start their normal grazing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that graze and want to get
those animals out of the barn as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible in the spring, this is a really
nice system to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also produces very, very high quality
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually, in some ways,
it seems to be a bit more balanced than
[SPEAKER_00]: the perennial pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennial pasture in the spring tends to
be very, very high in protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winter cereals aren't quite as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cows actually respond quite nicely
to the winter forage and produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: milk, according to the farmers I work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just end on forage brassicas,
because these have become popular in cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop mixes, but are also very popular for
grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another crop that we've done a lot of
work looking at planning date and yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think really what we found over the
years is planning a forage brassica by
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-August is ideal to get enough biomass
to be able to graze end of October into
[SPEAKER_00]: early November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't start thinking about planning
your forage brassica September 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though intuitively that's what you
would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm probably out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a system that one of our
farmers uses, and I'll turn it over to Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okie dokie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean shorter season vegetables?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like are there particular crops that
are good to team up with, like a cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you ultimately want to team
every crop up with a cover crop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are vegetable producers in this
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm one of those too, actually on
a vegetable farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think generally, at least on our
vegetable farm, it's very diverse and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have crops coming in and out all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really planning cover
cropping for each one of those particular
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a really different system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, you know, Pete,
do you want to say anything about what you
[SPEAKER_00]: do?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find that we're cover cropping
almost all year long in our vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, not just at a particular time,
like many dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it works really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not done that, but we've tried to
into rolled down style cover cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're talking about is
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, you're you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the system and saying this will
fit well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this is my best land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we find now is that even
though people want, you know, it'd be nice
[SPEAKER_00]: to wait a little bit, but here's our time
and we're just going and it may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little less yield, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's a trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's for at least the
farmers I've been working with and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the same with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's also giving farmers another
way to manage that cover crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does get a little ahead of them,
harder to burn down, harder to plow under
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take it a speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw a lot of that this year with
the weather that we had in Vermont before.

University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
Thank you.
