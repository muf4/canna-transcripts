[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Dawn, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I can't express how happy I am
to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it virtually, it's an honor to come
back and have a chance to share what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been up to in the four years since leaving
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think back oftentimes,
particularly in the autumn, about how
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous the campus and all of the area
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that you can all get back on
campus soon because it is something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: miss dearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take you on a bit of a
walk across North America in 350 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see what the 350 meters
references shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, I wanted to acknowledge that
you're seeing a very small portion of what
[SPEAKER_01]: UBC Botanical Garden has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any of you ever make it out to this
part of my beautiful country, I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage you to visit the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of four curators here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the rest of our curatorial team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura Caddy on the left, it curates our
alpine garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryo Tsujiyama in the middle there is the
curator for our Japanese garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's me on the right in the red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Behind me is Andy Hill, and he curates our
Asian garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a significant collection here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the back with the beard is Douglas
Justice, and he's the associate director
[SPEAKER_01]: of horticulture and curation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So collectively, this team stewards much
more than you will have a chance to see
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to acknowledge the work that
they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collectively, this team curates and
stewards close to 8,000 accessions in our
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, representing 5,200 and 70
different taxa from 189 plant families
[SPEAKER_01]: represented by over 1,000 genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see a small snippet of our
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you find yourself in this part of
the world, please come and see us and
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to give you a tour of the
rest of the garden as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to acknowledge before
starting that University of British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia is on the land of the Musqueam
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our local Indigenous band here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the university campus in Point Grey,
where I'm located, is on the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: ancestral and unceded territory of the
Musqueam people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to acknowledge that before
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you a sense of where I am on our
vast continent for those that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with the Wild Wild West,
this is North America, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red circle on the upper left is
the location of Southern British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite a remarkable part of the
continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't had a chance to visit,
please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We zoom in a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the greater Vancouver area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Fraser River is a large, very
important river here, river system for the
[SPEAKER_01]: local ecology and the local people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red circle that you're seeing this
time is Vancouver's Point Grey campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the site for our botanic garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a wonderful coastal situation
looking out onto the Salish Sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we zoom in a little bit further,
this is Point Grey campus itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look in the lower left,
you'll see another shape sort of drawn
[SPEAKER_01]: out, this long sort of peninsular space
and this sort of awkward space that wraps
[SPEAKER_01]: around a stadium here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the site of UBC Botanical Garden
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our garden has celebrated our hundred and
third anniversary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over that time, we've actually moved
sites twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been at this site since the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we zoom in a little bit closer,
this is the botanical garden site itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver has seen a tremendous amount of
growth over the last decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that growth has come more
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see is our garden is currently
divided in two by a four-lane divided
[SPEAKER_01]: highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our Southwest Gardens and our
Northeast Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: For today's talk, we're going to focus in
even further on the Northeast Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, the space that's
outlined here are the North American
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens here at UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The North American Gardens are comprised
of four distinct garden areas representing
[SPEAKER_01]: the biogeographical and floristic
communities of four distinct regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is our BC Rainforest Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we will start our journey of
350 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second being the Pacific Slope Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll move to the Gary Oak Meadow and
Woodland Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the Carolinian Forest Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of the presentation references
the fact that you can walk from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the rainforest garden to the
beginning of the Carolinian Forest,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the walk that we will do in 350
meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really great opportunity for
people to come to our garden and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: native flora of this region, but also of
Eastern North America as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start with our BC
Rainforest Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed you the region that we were in a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Vancouver is fortunate to be situated
in one of North America's temperate
[SPEAKER_01]: rainforest regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We receive annually over 50 inches of
rainfall that happens here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're extremely moderated by our
proximity to the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you a sense of just how moderate,
our annual temperature in January,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is our coldest month, is 36 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still above freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do get snow here, but it never stays
for more than a day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the heat of summer in August,
or sort of July, which is our hottest
[SPEAKER_01]: month, we'll reach an average of 55
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also quite moderate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some heat for sure,
but overall, we're quite a moderate
[SPEAKER_01]: climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, we have this lush
temperate rainforest environment that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're situated in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our BC Rainforest Garden does not look
quite as lush as that first image.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are situated in an area that has been
heavily developed and altered over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while this garden does seek to
represent the local BC rainforest plant
[SPEAKER_01]: communities authentically, there are some
aspects of our local rainforest that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just can't replicate given lower humidity
due to development and increased air
[SPEAKER_01]: movement and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The garden itself, I wanted to acknowledge
a couple of people in the creation of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the BC Rainforest Garden is
actually dedicated to the man in the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: right, and his name is John Davidson.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first provincial botanist for
British Columbia and was later brought on
[SPEAKER_01]: by the university to start the botanical
gardens themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1819.
[SPEAKER_01]: And above him is a man named Al Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Al Rose was a very active employee at
the Botanic Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first curator for our native
garden in the 70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, by all accounts, an
exceptional field botanist and
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulturist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a tremendous amount of work
collecting plants from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: province, from our wet rainforest coast
through to our dry, interior up to our
[SPEAKER_01]: far, far north and alpine areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made something like a thousand
collections a year for a decade and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give you perspective, a good
collecting year for me, I would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: get a 200 maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was an exceptional individual in
building these collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when he retired in the 80s,
funding and staffing structures didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: allow for his replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Al Rose built this garden that was
representative of flora from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: province, really, really rich collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was abandoned by and large for
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, this garden space,
a number of those plants that were not
[SPEAKER_01]: locally adapted and couldn't survive
without the horticultural care had died
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sad story, but there are still some
beautiful relics from his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what that garden looks like
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've narrowed the scope from BC native to
BC rainforest native to reflect the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that can survive and are locally adapted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very much like some of the park
spaces that happen in and around
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways that's challenging to get
people to understand that they are in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: in a garden and not in a park when they're
in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the trade-off is that we have
some really lovely moments that happen
[SPEAKER_01]: that are fully natural expressing the
local ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the right, we see an old stump
of a Western red cedar and our Western
[SPEAKER_01]: hemlocks grow out of these stumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you end up with these incredibly
beautiful moments in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be almost impossible to
recreate if this garden wasn't given that
[SPEAKER_01]: time on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the balance here is that we have some
really great demonstrations of local
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of UBC's gardens visitors are
actually tourists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge tourist population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love this garden because people come
from all over the world and within the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden itself can see intact functioning
local ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of accessions in here
that are remaining from Al Rose's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also been fortunate to build
these collections up over the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing what can happen when you
get back into a garden space and provide
[SPEAKER_01]: that care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful garden, particularly in
the early spring when things are leafing
[SPEAKER_01]: out and it's just this lush light green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And importantly, the gardens themselves
are not all about plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of work with people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to just highlight one
particular relationship that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: privileged to be involved in and its
relevance to my role as a curator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left is a white fawn lily,
a plant called Erythronium Oregonum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this plant in the picture here is
actually one of Al Rose's historic
[SPEAKER_01]: collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been in the garden for 35 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always admired it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful spring ephemeral,
very, very beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through some partnerships,
I've learned that there's just so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more to this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the right, you'll see a photo of
Tara Moreau is on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is our associate director of
sustainability and community programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the middle is Vanessa Campbell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanessa is a language specialist with the
Musqueam Indian Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's me on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been working to do a lot of
co-created programming and knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing between the Botanic Garden and the
Musqueam people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through this dialogue, I learned that
the name Musqueam for the Indian Band
[SPEAKER_01]: translates to people of the river grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story is so powerful related to
the creation of the salmon streams that
[SPEAKER_01]: sustain the indigenous cultures here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story is that a double-headed
serpent carved these streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the wake of that carving of those
streams, the river grass grew along these
[SPEAKER_01]: rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's kind of been lost over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What river grass is, the written and oral
histories associated with a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous cultures are only now just sort
of being pieced back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some talk through Vanessa.
[SPEAKER_01]: She shared some wonderful insights with me
that the plant itself, there's one story
[SPEAKER_01]: that the grass produced a white knotting
flower in the early spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some thought that it actually
might be this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a curator, my role is to manage
these collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, one of Al Rose's
historic collections takes on even greater
[SPEAKER_01]: importance given its relevance to our
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Musqueam are literally the garden's
closest neighbors and whose land we are
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been one of the really
rewarding aspects of my job is working
[SPEAKER_01]: with people as much as plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on to the next garden
area in our 350-meter journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our Pacific Slope Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're moving out of one of the oldest
garden areas on site and certainly the
[SPEAKER_01]: oldest in the North American collections
to the newest garden area.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about what is the Pacific
Slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pacific Slope basically denotes the
western-facing slopes of the Coast Range
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountains and the Cascade Ranges,
including the Klamath Mountains and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Siskiyous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ecosystem that ranges basically
from northern Washington State through
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and down into northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this area, if you've ever been,
it's truly spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's most well known for its gigantic
conifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a picture on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a trip I was fortunate to be on
with some folks from the Royal Botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden, Edinburgh, when they were doing
some collecting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smaller tree in the center is,
by all accounts, a massive western
[SPEAKER_01]: hemlock, but it's completely dwarfed by
these enormous Sitka spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not an uncommon sight along
the Pacific Slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important in particular for its
richness in conifer diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a map that denotes species
richness in conifers throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll see is we've got some hot
spots around Japan, Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest conifer diversity is in New
Caledonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: UBC Botanical Garden doesn't have any
collections under glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have greenhouses outside of our
propagation facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to be growing those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you turn your eyes to North
America, what you see is that region that
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw in the earlier slide, those western
slopes, have extremely high conifer
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a global context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really great opportunity for
conifer conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these plants occur in very
limited areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about climate change and
the projections for that, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the entirety of the world,
but in particular that region,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, California is on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times do you hear that a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking to turn our focus to
conifer conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are projections that in light of
climate change, our climate may actually
[SPEAKER_01]: be better suited for some of these plants
in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is some of the work that I do as
a curator is planning a garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just for the next three, five,
10 years, but hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're focusing this garden in on
the conifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not all about conifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also targeting the phagaceae,
so the oak family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are a couple of accessions that
are currently in there that I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: people think oak as being particularly
gorgeous, but there are some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quercus callaugii, the California black
oak on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leaves out with these sort of velvety
pink leaves that I think rival any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: magnolias in terms of beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Notholithocarpus densiflorus,
just with these really cute little nuts
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to form and a nice flush of
velvety new green.
[SPEAKER_01]: This garden is again, as I say,
the earliest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year received a very generous
donation from some of our network of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that support the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how project work happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been sitting on this idea for a
number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an injection of funds and we start
to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some of the early work that I
did with the landscape architect here,
[SPEAKER_01]: developing some concept plans and refining
the scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to say that just last month
we started breaking ground and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: currently what this garden looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we've moved from a garden
that has 40 years of history in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rainforest garden to one that is just
currently taking shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremendously excited about this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of opportunity for
interpretation to our visitors about the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of climate change on biodiversity
in our region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, the photo I showed earlier of
colleagues from the Royal Botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden, Edinburgh on a collecting
expedition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, we did participate in an
expedition throughout this region a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these young plants in our nursery are
ready to go out into the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, lots of conifers,
which is again, the total focus of this
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about 200 maybe meters into our
journey across North America at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to move into, it's hard to
say what's my favorite of the four
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens, but this garden here is a pretty
spectacular garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our Gary Oak Meadow and
Woodland garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a garden that is neither the oldest
nor the youngest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been on site for about 15 years and
is a representative of a local meadow
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem that occurs here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the distribution of these Gary
Oak Meadows in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are characterized by a plant called
the Gary Oak, Quercus gariana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only oak native to British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the range on this ecosystem you can
see sweeps down through on the eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: slopes of those coastal mountains that we
were talking about when we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: with Pacific Slope Garden, which is a lot
drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in rain shadow area, and then
comes back out to the coast in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look closely above the national
boundary, there is a splattering of red in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And locally, these meadows are restricted
to the eastern coast of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a bit of a rain shadow on
Vancouver Island, similar to the rain
[SPEAKER_01]: shadow that happens throughout the coastal
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bit of a rain shadow on
Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So warm, moist air comes over the crest,
hits the island, drops most of its
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture on the west side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bit of a sunnier break,
if you will, by Vancouver standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Southern California, but by
Vancouver standards, it's a little drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that supports a very different
plant community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our native plant community is
conifer-dominated forest, large stature
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, very, very damp, very, very dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by contrast, these meadows that creep
up into North America are open and sunny
[SPEAKER_01]: and exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, a whole different plant
community exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that I would like to
mention in the distribution is because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a number of plants in this
garden, and I'll get to the garden itself
[SPEAKER_01]: in a second, that are of local
conservation concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have forest or plant
communities that have this type of range,
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly extensive in the United States,
but just come up into Canada, the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant risk and threat is assessed is
there's three levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a provincial or state assessment,
a national assessment, and then a global
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a number of the plants that occur in
the Gary Oak Meadows, by the very nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of it being very restricted here in
Canada, are considered nationally
[SPEAKER_01]: endangered.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of these plants are not
necessarily at risk of going extinct in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild, but we are at risk of losing
them in our local environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have local populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants at these extended range,
sort of far extents of these ranges,
[SPEAKER_01]: are particularly valuable for plant
conservation in that they may possess
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that allow them to be better
adapted to extremes throughout their
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about the conservation
value of the Gary Oak Meadows here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about, by and large,
population conservation, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: just a tax on conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Gary Oak Meadows are extremely at
risk here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was mentioning that this is a little bit
drier, a little bit sunnier, it's coastal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got beautiful views, and this is
exactly where people want to settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's estimated that about two and a
half percent of what was originally intact
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary Oak Meadows remain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The meadows themselves are totally
gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Gary Oak Meadow here at UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can see is, in stark contrast
to the rainforest garden that I showed,
[SPEAKER_01]: open, exposed, sunny sites that just
support really diverse grasses and forbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gary Oak Meadow, even though it's
quite limited in its distribution,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think back to that range map in
Canada, is actually hosts more
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity and specifically plant
biodiversity than anywhere else in our
[SPEAKER_01]: province, even though it's got such a
limited range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very important garden for
conservation and our messaging around
[SPEAKER_01]: human impact with plants and what people
can do to help the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this garden didn't always look
quite this lush.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I arrived in July of 2016,
the meadow was largely dormant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: following spring, I did a bit of an
assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is to care for and oversee these
accessioned collections, but without
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing what's in them, it's hard to make
decisions about how to best do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the first year I was here,
we did an inventory of this meadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the bottom right, you see Tim
Chipchar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of our horticulturists here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was fortunate to work with Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a number of years of field botany
experience as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through this meadow and took
herbarium specimens and identified all the
[SPEAKER_01]: species that were remaining in here
because over time this meadow had sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: moved around, as is the case with a lot of
these style of plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things had moved, things had seeded
around, things had died out, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: records weren't always kept up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we finished the inventory and we
finally settled on agreement on some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the taxa that we were seeing in here,
I don't know that I slept for about a week
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was just in shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: This meadow in certain areas had become
completely overrun by invasive grasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: largely sweet vernal grass and creeping
bentgrass, although a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while the photo on the left may look
quite pretty, oh, look, a meadow with some
[SPEAKER_01]: camas in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sort of burgundy grass that you see
is sweet vernal grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that it is almost all
that's left.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some instances, 95% cover and sweet
vernal grass is incredibly allelopathic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actively suppressing the growth
and regeneration of the native plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tackling this meadow is a bit of a
challenge because here at UBC,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't use any herbicides, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a garden-wide mandate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so typically in a meadow restoration,
in a situation like this, you go in and
[SPEAKER_01]: you apply glyphosate a couple of times and
basically start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we've just been marching ahead
with basically digging this meadow out
[SPEAKER_01]: over a series of three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: All is not lost, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were sections of our meadow that
were still intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what this meadow looks like
in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly rich with ephemeral
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, mentioning that it's a dry summer
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much as our region is a temperate
rainforest, we do experience a very
[SPEAKER_01]: significant summer drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this meadow is totally adapted for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in spring, you have all these
ephemerals that come up, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: geophytes, bulbs, things like that,
but also annual plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put on this tremendous show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by midsummer, the garden is going
dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to identify through our
inventory areas in this garden that
[SPEAKER_01]: remained intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left is actually the garden at
UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right is a Gary Oak meadow out on
Vancouver Island I visited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that there are still a lot
of similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did have these pockets that we
could pull from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've been doing is
propagating those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we march the meadow renovation
forward, reintroducing plants from those
[SPEAKER_01]: original accessions that remain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a lot of work, but totally
worth it because this garden is locally
[SPEAKER_01]: endangered, checks all our boxes from our
mission in terms of conservation,
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting scientific research,
education to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a tremendous amount of
interpretive signage in this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as display, it is absolutely
breathtaking, the display that happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right is an area that was renovated
two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see here is actually more
indicative of what these meadows would
[SPEAKER_01]: look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the grasses, the good guys that
should be here, a mix of annual and
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial forms in growing in and amongst
those grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we've been able to rid
ourselves of those allelopathic grasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants are actually seeding
themselves back into the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no shortage of hard work, but a
complete success story and one I'm quite
[SPEAKER_01]: proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, the Gary Oak meadows
are a threatened ecosystem here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of endangered
plants that we have in this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are quite showy and
charismatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the center are a couple of our less
charismatic ones, a sedge, carrots,
[SPEAKER_01]: tumulacola, and camisomia contort of a
little yellow flower that's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeters across.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all of our conservation plants,
you would even notice when you walk
[SPEAKER_01]: through this garden, but it's loaded with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these plants that you see here,
though, are secure throughout the southern
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of this range of the Gary Oak
meadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one particular plant that I'm
particularly interested in in this meadow
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we've been successful with is
called golden paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a plant called Castilea
levicecta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Castilea are in the Orabankaceae family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a family of plants that are
largely parasitic or hemiparasitic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Castilea levicecta is a hemiparasitic
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it parasitizes other plants,
but also produces chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can self sustain, but does much
better if it has host plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Castilea are notoriously difficult to
propagate and then even more so cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: in a garden setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of those things that people
always say best left in the wild,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been trying here and we've had a
lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Castilea levicecta, we've been able to
propagate a few hundred of these quite
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully with a few different hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing with a native fescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also grow it with a few
Crassulaceae plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've now planted these out into the
meadow for a second year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing about a 60, 65 percent
success rate, which by all accounts is
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very good for this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bit of a success story here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unlike the plants in the previous
slide, this is a plant that is not only at
[SPEAKER_01]: risk here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada at a national level,
but is globally endangered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extremely limited range on this plant in
the wild and the same threats that face
[SPEAKER_01]: the Garyoke Meadows here in British
Columbia are present throughout the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of this plant's range to the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very fortunate to work with some
local recovery teams who have supplied us
[SPEAKER_01]: with high quality known provenance seeds
so we can grow plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimately of conservation value for
this endangered species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, we're in the homestretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to cross the finish line as we
run the 350 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to end off in the Carolinian
Forest Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a garden that might be confusing
to many of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the flora of the Carolinas
specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the Carolinian?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Carolinian Forest Zone is largely a
Canadian term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It originated from some plant biologists
and silviculturists back in the 18 and
[SPEAKER_01]: early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a term used to describe a very
distinct forest system that shows up just
[SPEAKER_01]: in southern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're familiar with the area on the
top left, you see that there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: sweeping line that says northern limit of
the Carolinian Zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of sweeps from north of
Toronto down towards London and over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Grand Bend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very limited distribution of this
forest type in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you think about the
development in Canada, and particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario, this is also the most densely
populated and heavily human impacted
[SPEAKER_01]: region in our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of parallels between this
forest and the Gary Oak Meadows in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of national plant conservation,
northern range conservation, and education
[SPEAKER_01]: around human impact in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photo on the left bottom does show
that that light sort of lime green colour
[SPEAKER_01]: is the Eastern deciduous forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what you probably would
know the Carolinian as.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an ecosystem and a forest type that
does have a much larger range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of the plants that we grow
here are very abundant south of the
[SPEAKER_01]: border, but quite rare from a national
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a similarity with this garden and
the Gary Oak Meadow is the biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: here is extremely high from a national
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see just how limited that range
is, but half of Canada's tree species grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in that range and over half of its
vascular plant species, so all the grasses
[SPEAKER_01]: and forbs and things like that,
over half of our national plant
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity can be found growing in these
forests, despite their extremely limited
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right is typically what this
forest looks like in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fortunate to grow up in this forest
when Dawn mentioned I spent my youth
[SPEAKER_01]: exploring the forest and propagating
plants from my local surroundings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the forest I was trekking
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was very happy when I arrived here to
find that a little piece of home also met
[SPEAKER_01]: me here on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this garden is also about 12,
13 years old, so not the oldest,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the youngest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what it looks like right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, probably the most well-known
aspect of the Eastern deciduous forest is
[SPEAKER_01]: its fall color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say that we don't get the fall
color here in Vancouver that we get back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the East, even though we're growing the
same plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's largely climactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get those wild swings between
cold, cold nights and warm days that would
[SPEAKER_01]: very quickly break down chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do get some nice fall color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is the shot of that
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some lovely light coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there wasn't always lovely light
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I arrived in this garden,
it was obvious to me that a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: trees needed to be cut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we don't use herbicides here,
when this garden was created, it was put
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of what used to be sort of weedy,
herbaceous ornamental beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants were dug out,
but a number of them were very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a number of persistent
perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the decision was made to plant this
garden extremely densely with large
[SPEAKER_01]: stature trees in an effort to shade out
those weeds, which is part of an
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated pest management plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't use herbicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, these trees were not thinned as
they grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first few months that I was
here, I did a quick assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my first winter, we actually
removed something like 85 trees from this
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure it raised a few
eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did we hire the wrong guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is he cutting down our garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a decision that needed to be
made because these trees are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely fast in our climate,
much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than they would back east.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were getting to this crucial point
where if we let them live any longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would become complicated removals
based on their size and proximity to one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the result is that the remaining trees
have responded exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those trees are extremely
important to us here at UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: UBC Botanical Garden is part of the plant
collections network.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working for magnolias and maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cordell Botanic Garden is part of this
group for the maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of some of that thinning,
a number of our key accessions have done
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely well and responded well to
increase light and increase air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of super charismatic plants here,
magnolia macrophylla and magnolia
[SPEAKER_01]: virginiana are amongst our magnolia
collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the photo on the left is not a trickle
of the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: These flowers are up to a foot across and
just incredibly showy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was one of these outside the
offices at Cordell Botanic Garden that
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately came down while I was a
student due to, I think, structural
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that the garden is considering
having another in its collections because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're wonderful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also through the thinning we managed
to be able to successfully grow plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: the understory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So previously, light was not coming
through this forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the clearing, the shrub layer in the
understory has responded incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhododendrons that previously bloomed only
moderately have now decided to put on a
[SPEAKER_01]: riot of color in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Rhododendron vacii, another of our
threatened plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's globally threatened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have four accessions represented by
30-some wild plants, all of known wild
[SPEAKER_01]: provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conservation value aside, this is just a
spectacularly gorgeous plant that blooms
[SPEAKER_01]: in the early spring before any of the
leaves come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see these pink puff balls in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also with the increased light,
we can now grow plants in the understory
[SPEAKER_01]: that are herbaceous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously, this garden was too shady and
too dense to really support these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, this is where a lot of the
magic happens in this garden, the spring
[SPEAKER_01]: ephemerals that occur in the woods around
campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about how rich and beautiful
that scene is, we are now able to create
[SPEAKER_01]: that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been working very hard over
the last few years to create that with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to show you how we
create that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm fortunate that a number of our
volunteers and our friends of the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: support me financially to do wild plant
collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is very important for our garden
in terms of meeting our mission of
[SPEAKER_01]: curating a collection of known provenance
wild collected material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is probably the highlight of
my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are bugs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get soakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get banged up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's incredibly rewarding to go out on
these trips and collect plants to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them back for our garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes me everywhere from lakeside
to forests to dry interior to alpine
[SPEAKER_01]: mountaintops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really a crucial part of my
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like, you know, this would be
minor, but there aren't a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for wild collected seed
available to me unless I do collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a crucial part of what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's largely how I build my
collections here at UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's been a 350 meter walk across
North America and some of the exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and plant communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage you all to get out into
your local forest and appreciate them as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as come visit us at UBC if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, I'd like to thank
Cornell University for the years that I
[SPEAKER_01]: spent there, the friendships and knowledge
that I gained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to thank CALS in particular
for supporting the public garden
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Cornell Botanic Gardens for also
making that possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be where I am without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a special thanks to all the grad
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maria is pictured here.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the one who reached out to me
initially, Maria and Dawn, to invite me
[SPEAKER_01]: here to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few minutes for some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to thank Ben for an
absolutely fascinating presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I so appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, that you spoke not only about the
horticultural considerations of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in your collections, but also the
botanical and biogeographic
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will now welcome any questions that
folks may have for Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ben, you can also look in the chat
feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I believe that there is at least one
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I've got the chat window open now.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so Rec Beach, I'm just going to
address that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually right across the road from
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a number of our staff at the end of a
hot day in August will head straight down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a question, is prescribed
controlled fire used as a management tool?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I would like to do
from a demonstration perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in our Gary Oak Meadow,
our largest issue right now are the
[SPEAKER_01]: grasses and the grasses we're dealing with
are also fire adapted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be a tool that we could use if
we got into situations where we were
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing woody plants moving in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, burning that meadow would
not actively solve too much of the issue
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I'm glad you mentioned fire,
because the Gary Oak Meadows, as they
[SPEAKER_01]: exist, were also extremely important to
the local Indigenous cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they persist not only because of the
soils and the exposure and the climate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also because of a history of
prescribed burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the local Indigenous cultures to keep
the area open, because a number of very
[SPEAKER_01]: important food and medicine plants grow in
that ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the wild, fire is actually an
incredibly important part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our garden management, not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also very difficult to set any part
of the campus on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rules and regulations around that are
very tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I invite any of the other participants
to unmute themselves if they do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: question for Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, let me ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The various collections that you showed us
are more what I would refer to as
[SPEAKER_00]: naturalistic, rather than highly designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you interpret them for the public
so that visitors can appreciate these as
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural collections and not as what
you were saying, just parks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is definitely one of our
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole of UBC Botanic Garden,
by and large, is focused on plants as they
[SPEAKER_01]: would occur in a natural way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some more formal spaces,
a physics garden and a food garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of an events lawn with a more
traditional perennial border and that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we try and do is we
luckily had an interpretive plan developed
[SPEAKER_01]: three years ago now that involved a number
of very large, well-designed information
[SPEAKER_01]: boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help people understand what it was that
they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in front of strategic locations or
strategic plants or plantings,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the plants that they're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, through our database,
we use a data behind all of this as a
[SPEAKER_01]: custom database called IrisBG,
which is a software that was developed
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically for managing botanic
collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that, we have launched a
garden explorer so people can go on this
[SPEAKER_01]: app and look for particular plants or
based on the area that they're standing
[SPEAKER_01]: in, know what plants are around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also designed through that a
number of specific tours that our guests
[SPEAKER_01]: can take that will take them around to
specific plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we try and make sure that all of
our collections are accurately labeled,
[SPEAKER_01]: but particularly those that are along
those predetermined tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any final questions for Ben?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go from Raleigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's mentioning that we have a canopy
walk here in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually not in my rainforest garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the Asian garden and our Asian
garden is planted amongst an intact
[SPEAKER_01]: coastal rainforest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go up through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we do get here,
even though I was saying that we don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: as lush a moss sort of diversity hanging
from branches and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our Asian garden in particular,
because it has an irrigation system and
[SPEAKER_01]: higher humidity, we do get epiphytes
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So various bryophytes in the canopy and a
few ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The canopy itself isn't sort of actively
managed in that garden space beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that it impacts the Asian plant
collections below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So decisions are made about removals and
thinning and planting of the overstory,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's largely in a way or a decision
made about the impact that would have on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Asian plants that grow beneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the best of my knowledge,
there haven't been any active studies up
[SPEAKER_01]: in that canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do engage with researchers from the
university, but largely the research that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens here is driven by the interests of
the labs on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we provide what we can based on what
they need as opposed to actively sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: directing that research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people on campus aren't interested
in studying it, we actually don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity in our staff to study it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our involvement in research is to supply
material to researchers as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we have run out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to again thank Ben for an
intriguing and information-filled
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are sorry that you can't be with us in
person, but look forward to seeing you
[SPEAKER_00]: again sometime in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, bye-bye now.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
