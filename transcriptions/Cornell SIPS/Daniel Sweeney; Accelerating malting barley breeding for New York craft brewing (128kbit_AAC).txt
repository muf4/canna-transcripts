[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be talking a bit about my
research of malting barley today.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so in 2012, there were 92 craft
breweries in New York, or breweries in
[SPEAKER_01]: general New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in 2018, we have over 400 breweries in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that time frame, breweries across the
United States have boomed, but the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: in breweries is particularly striking in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of this could be attributed to the
Farm Brewery Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a state bill that was passed in
2012 that provides economic incentives for
[SPEAKER_01]: breweries to use locally produced
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, at the current quota,
farm breweries must use at least 20%
[SPEAKER_01]: locally grown hops and 20% locally grown
malts to qualify for these incentives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That quota increases to 60% in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a couple weeks here,
and increases finally to 9% in 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we're producing enough malting
barley in New York to meet these quotas,
[SPEAKER_01]: even at the 60% increase in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Cornell Cooperative Extension has
set an ambitious goal of 30,000 acres by
[SPEAKER_01]: 2023 to account for the demand at the 90%
quota.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're to meet that goal,
we must increase malting barley acreage in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, high quality malting barley is
not an easy thing to produce in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is largely due to the wet human
climate in New York that we frequently
[SPEAKER_01]: have during our summers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a long list of problems that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna talk about two today
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is pre-harvest sprouting,
which is a premature loss of dormancy in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field before the grain is harvested,
which can result in early germination when
[SPEAKER_01]: a moisture event occurs, such as a heavy
dew or prolonged rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second that I'll talk about is foliar
disease, specifically leaf rust and spot
[SPEAKER_01]: blotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both fungal diseases that can
cause yield loss, and spot blotch can also
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively impact grain quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to meet these challenges, the Cornell
Small Grains Breeding Program initiated a
[SPEAKER_01]: project that we're calling Born,
Bred, and Brewed in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goals are to support farm brewing,
by quickly meeting the needs of local
[SPEAKER_01]: malters and brewers who are operating
under the Farm Brewery Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to breed high dormancy to
avoid pre-harvest sprouting, disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant varieties that have high malting
quality across the variety of New York
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malting quality also needs to be stable
because malters and brewers need a
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent supply of malt to make
consistent gear year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do this, we're establishing a two
row spring barley breeding program at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malters and brewers want a New York barley
variety yesterday, so we have to act
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally, seeing that I'm in the
Sorrell's lab and then I'm at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_01]: our approach is going to be genomic
selection, but we wanted to hit a home run
[SPEAKER_01]: on the first try because with this strict
time limit set by the Farm Brewery Bill,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have a lot of time to waste in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our approach is to use a nested
association mapping style designed for our
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic prediction training population.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those not familiar with the nested
association mapping panel or NAM,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's basically a collection of hapsid
families connected by a common parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea here is to use the beneficial
statistical properties of the NAM to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase our prediction accuracy to higher
relatedness, large population size,
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient genotyping due to
population structure, ideally increase
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic variability, increase genetic
experience for multiple families instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of just one or two, and then also high
power for genome-wide association studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're doing genomic prediction,
we're not interested in the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture per se of these traits,
but we're interested in adding any high
[SPEAKER_01]: effects marker loci as fixed effects in
our prediction models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if none of these work, it's still the
use of breeding population to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our approach was to use the Canadian
variety AAC synergy as our common parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has performed fairly well for us in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has high yield, high wealth quality,
and high disease resistance, but does not
[SPEAKER_01]: have good pre-harvest breeding resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used seven other lines to cross the
synergy, and we ended up with a population
[SPEAKER_01]: of about 1,300 lines, so a little under
200 lines per family.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, so last field season,
two heads of locations of F3-derived F4
[SPEAKER_01]: lines were grown, and phenotype for the
traits listed there to train the
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year, a subset of 100 lines from
that training population were drawn in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regional yield trials, and I'll come back
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this principal component analysis here
gives a nice indication of the population
[SPEAKER_01]: structure here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the colors got a little washed out,
but the green and orange dots there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: left are all crosses made from North
American germ plazo.
[SPEAKER_01]: North American barley germ plasm is not
very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been heavily selected for malting
quality over the past 50 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's all pretty closely related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there at the top, there's this
little yellow cluster that's actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't realize that Newdale was one of
the parents of synergy, but it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the blue dots here in the middle,
that's a European by Canadian cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the European malting barley germ plasm
is kept pretty separate from North
[SPEAKER_01]: American germ plasm, so a lot more
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so our genotyping approach for this
population was to genotype the progeny at
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher plex than the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this many lines, we needed four
libraries, so the parents were present in
[SPEAKER_01]: each of those four libraries, which the
progeny were only present once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the parents got sequenced at a four
times greater depth than the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to align these sequences to
the recently updated barley reference
[SPEAKER_01]: genome, which is pretty good, so we're
confident in our physical positions of
[SPEAKER_01]: these markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all the parents are inbred lines
and are released varieties, I was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: stringent with the parental filters,
so removed any heterozygous sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: any missing sites, and only kept sites
that I was very confident for those
[SPEAKER_01]: genotype calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within family, I imputed
monomorphic markers to its parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: and any other missing data were imputed
with expectation maximization in R or blub
[SPEAKER_01]: in R.
[SPEAKER_01]: The usual heterozygosity and non-relative
frequency filters within family,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a final filter to remove any
markers in very high equilibrium with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives me about 6,000 genome marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm working here with
single-trait g-blub models that I fit in
[SPEAKER_01]: ASGMO-R.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are tested with the 5-4 cross
validation with 3-5 ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot going on here,
but these gray boxes correspond to
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction accuracies with the entire set,
and each of the colored boxes refers to
[SPEAKER_01]: the individual families here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple trends that jump out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that when you look at the
gray boxes, these prediction accuracies
[SPEAKER_01]: for the whole set, they tend to be as high
or higher than prediction accuracies
[SPEAKER_01]: within each family.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we were hoping to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prediction accuracies within each family
vary widely depending on each trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's largely because the genetic
variants in each of these families varies
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically notice this yellow box here
in the middle, this is our back-cross
[SPEAKER_01]: family, and has consistently low
prediction accuracy for each trait,
[SPEAKER_01]: and is consistently lower than the
majority of the other families.
[SPEAKER_01]: The standard deviations for the prediction
accuracies are quite a bit higher for
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-harvest sprouting and spot blotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's likely due to incomplete phenotyping
for those traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-harvest sprouting is a very
labor-intensive and time-sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype, so we weren't able to phenotype
that large the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spot blotch, the data was
incomplete due to premature senescence
[SPEAKER_01]: because of rapid disease progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: GWAS models were fit in our blup with a
single principal component added to count
[SPEAKER_01]: the population structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hits that we see for leaf rust and for
spot blotch lie within regions that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been previously mapped for these two
traits, so we're fairly confident that
[SPEAKER_01]: these are real.
[SPEAKER_01]: This very large effects locus here for
pre-harvest sprouting is in the region
[SPEAKER_01]: that a recently cloned dormancy gene lies
in, and that dormancy gene is located for
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-harvest sprouting, so also confident
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this height locus is close to a
well-described, commonly used
[SPEAKER_01]: semi-dwarfing gene using European
multi-barley germplasm, and that allele is
[SPEAKER_01]: only present in the European like Canadian
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the marker data seems that's useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're not interested in
understanding genetic architecture per se
[SPEAKER_01]: of these traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see if it increases prediction
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it seems that only adding
that very large effect marker loci for
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-harvest sprouting increases prediction
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when we take a little bit closer
look at trait heritability and percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: of genetic variants explained by these
loci, the picture is a little more clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rex Bernardo was looking at the same
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a simulation study in 2010,
and his results somewhat mirror mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for traits that have low heritability
and have, let's say, a GWAS set that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't explain that much of the genetic
variants, so something like height or spot
[SPEAKER_01]: blotch, low percentage of genetic variants
explained, adding a fixed effect doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really change prediction accuracy is what
we see for height and spot blotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, for a trait like pre-harvest
sprouting that has very high heritability
[SPEAKER_01]: and has a locus that explains a lot of the
genetic variants, not surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will increase your prediction
accuracy is what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: LeafRest is a bit puzzling though,
because we have high heritability and the
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of genetic variants explained
is not low, but it's not really increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little mysterious still.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we use the 2017 training population
data though to predict unobserved trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: which in this case are 2018 real trials,
adding fixed effects as a more significant
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So N here is the number of 2018 real
trials that traits are measured in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we add fixed effects for these
traits, you can see prediction accuracy
[SPEAKER_01]: increases quite a bit, especially for
pre-harvest sprouting for all these
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: For something like pre-harvest sprouting,
this is particularly promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-harvest sprouting, like I said,
is a very time-intensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: labor-intensive process to phenotype,
and we can only do this locally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's one of our most important traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having good predictions for unobserved or
real trials for this trait would be of
[SPEAKER_01]: great value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing we'd like to do when we're
starting a genomic selection project from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch is to use as few markers as
possible to reduce costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at a number of different marker
densities, going from full marker density
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to one percent of the full
marker set, I sampled 25 different marker
[SPEAKER_01]: sets of each of these densities and used
five-fold cross-validation to test
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction accuracy of each of these sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Promisingly, it looks like we can go down
to about 10 percent of the total marker
[SPEAKER_01]: set and maintain prediction accuracy for
most traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 600 markers compared to 6,000
markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is partially due, I think,
because barley naturally has high-linked
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium, but also population structure
helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see prediction accuracy tails off much
more rapidly with pre-harvest sprouting,
[SPEAKER_01]: likely due to that single very large
effect locus of pre-harvest sprouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're only sampling 300 markers,
the probability of sampling a marker in LD
[SPEAKER_01]: with that main causal locus decreases
accordingly, so prediction accuracy drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, we would like to have smaller
training populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genotyping 1,340 lines is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did use a similar cross-validation
strategy in testing smaller training
[SPEAKER_01]: population sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most traits, we can get down to 50 to
75 percent of the full training population
[SPEAKER_01]: set size and still maintain prediction
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, again, we see this major drop off
in pre-harvest sprouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's largely due to
incomplete genotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm only starting with about 400
observations for pre-harvest sprouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you drop that by 75 or 50 percent,
you have many fewer individuals that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with these results and our regional
yield trials in 2018, plus yield trials
[SPEAKER_01]: next year, we're confident that in New
York malting barley is within reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've identified high-yielding,
disease-resistant, and pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: sprouting-resistant vines, but we still
don't know how they malt across
[SPEAKER_01]: environments and across years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is data we're waiting on,
and that picture will become more clear
[SPEAKER_01]: next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely speeding this process
along, and we're hoping to identify a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of candidate in fall 2019 and get
that in foundation seed in 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully farmer-released through the next
year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of my dissertation research
is using selections from this training
[SPEAKER_01]: population to initiate a genomic selection
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, completed two rounds of that,
but validation will be this summer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, so stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank my committee
members, also present members of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorrell's lab, and folks from the
Bergstrom and Evian's lab, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: funding partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark had grown yield trials for two or
three years before I got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and at the time, those were our best
performers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back, I would not choose some of
those parents, particularly Newdale,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that was in the back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Margaret asked, why did we choose the
parents that we did?
[SPEAKER_01]: We went on what existing data we had,
which was two or three years of yield
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to do this again, I would choose
some different parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just curious what you could
do, because I feel like all the prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy is like, what you really wanted
was the pre-harvest sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the hardest thing to predict,
at least with lower markers and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what could you do to, this is an
hypothetical question, if you were to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the experiment again, is there something
you could do differently to make sure your
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions of that are better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think the biggest thing would
be to phenotype them more completely,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that that, or sorry,
put the end of the question there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, pre-harvest sprouting
is our most important trait, but had the
[SPEAKER_01]: most severe drop in prediction accuracy
when we did subsets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key there is phenotyping more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we only phenotyped about 400
to 450 of those 1,300 lines, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to sample them at physiological
maturity, which is a very short window.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either we hire three times as many
undergrads, which could work, or we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller population size, or work 16 hour
days, either one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was pretty happy with the prediction
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew very little about the genetic
control of this trait in our population
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it worked in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a much better idea of that in
wheat, but these results I think are
[SPEAKER_01]: useful in barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's here.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the question was, there's this kind of
out-group line, Tinka, which is a European
[SPEAKER_01]: variety from KWS, so bred for continental
European climates like France and Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: which in our experience, those lines tend
to perform a little bit better in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of barley breeding in the
UK, but those lines are adapted to a
[SPEAKER_01]: maritime climate if you don't have it
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's much cooler in the UK,
and it can get pretty hot this summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: so lines bred for Germany and France do
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenotypically, it looks fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's susceptible to several diseases here,
but it has good moulting quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all two-row lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So zero-moulting barley all kind of sort
of looks the same, unless you spend hours
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it looks similar, but has a lot
more genetic triggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
