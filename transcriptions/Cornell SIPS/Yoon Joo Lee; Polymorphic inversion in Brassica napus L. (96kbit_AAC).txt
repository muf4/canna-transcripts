[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person who drew the luckiest number of
the day, when she drew number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: is Yoonju Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Yoonju comes to us from Incheon,
Korea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her mentors were Michael Gore and Elodie
Gozabe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her post-graduation plans are,
she's waiting for the admissions decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: to a graduate program in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wish her luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of her seminar today is
Polymorphic Inversion in Brassica Napus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my presentation today is about
polymorphic inversion in brassica napus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking about the evolutionary
process of brassica napus, process of
[SPEAKER_00]: brassica species, and what is polymorphic
inversion, and what are the strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use to detect polymorphic
inversion, and how we process the data to
[SPEAKER_00]: find affirmative SNPs that could help
confirming the polymorphic inversion in
[SPEAKER_00]: brassica napus species, and results and
conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a triangle of U, which represents
the relationship of six different brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three ancestral species,
respectively brassica nigra, brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: campestri and rapa, and brassica ulraceae,
that has one subgenome B, A, and C,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a chromosome number eight,
10, and nine, respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are three species that were
created due to interspecific hybridization
[SPEAKER_00]: between two ancestral species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the purpose of presentation today,
I'll be focusing on interspecific
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization of brassica napus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the evolution of brassica napus species
were created by brassica ulraceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kale, and brassica rapa and
campestri, such as bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went through interspecific
hybridization to create brassica napus,
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly known as canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Elodie Ghazavi was working on
brassica napus species, and she found the
[SPEAKER_00]: putative polymorphic inversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polymorphic inversion prevents homologous
region pairing during meiosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which do let go through recombination
between inversion heterozygotes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but products are not recovered,
that it's problematic for the breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers who are looking for better or
higher yielding crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the frequency distribution of
chloroplast haplotypes of brassica napus
[SPEAKER_00]: and its sister textile lineage have
strongly suggested that brassica napus
[SPEAKER_00]: have fully phialytic origin, with initial
hybridization event leading to synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: of brassica napus multiple times,
and probably involving different maternal
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: H1 is showing the ancestral lineage,
and H2, represented in blue, is showing
[SPEAKER_00]: derived character of the lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for studying of polymorphic inversion
of brassica napus, we gathered 16 samples
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide, and we mapped a chromosome map
of brassica napus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two subgenomes in brassica napus
with total of 19 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue showing chromosome A, and orange
showing chromosome C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied specifically chromosome C,
two, which has a large polymorphic
[SPEAKER_00]: inversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this chromosome map,
we gathered primer data for studying this
[SPEAKER_00]: putative polymorphic inversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So goal of this project was, first,
GBS genotyping by sequencing, and WGS
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome sequencing were pre-sequenced
by Dr. Elodie Ghazabi, and she found the
[SPEAKER_00]: putative inversion brassica napus sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used Sengar sequencing method and
other bioinformatic pipelines to validate
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the putative inversion that she
found were real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the steps that we used to
determine polymorphic inversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole genome sequencing, which is
sequencing the whole genome, and
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping by sequencing, which is looking
for single nucleotide polymorphism in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, were pre-sequenced by Dr. Elodie
Ghazabi, and we used SNPs that were from
[SPEAKER_00]: WGS and GBS to compare to confirm
polymorphic inversion, and also used a
[SPEAKER_00]: Sengar sequencing method to validate for
polymorphic inversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were 60 samples worldwide,
and we harvested those leaves using five
[SPEAKER_00]: different primers because there were SNPs
who were within all different locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were large, so it was hard to
flank all those genes with one primer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After DNA extraction, we went through PCR
to amplify a gene of interest and do DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: purification to get rid of contaminants,
and went through Sengar sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which screens the identification of
sequence variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used different bioinformatics pipelines
from Linux operating systems to Python and
[SPEAKER_00]: Excel for confirming if the polymorphic
inversion is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Sengar sequencing, we looked at the
pattern where one is showing the fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles across orientation, which does not
give informative or unique information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and two, three, and five is alleles that
are variable across orientation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that there are some
inversions within the pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: but however, if you look up, there are
alleles that are just fixed, which does
[SPEAKER_00]: not give informative SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look at number four,
there are SNPs that are different in two
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation, but they are fixed,
which could be informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the result from one of the data we
got from Sengar sequencing that first
[SPEAKER_00]: letter is a diagnostic of ancestral
lineage, respectively, G and T,
[SPEAKER_00]: and second letter is a diagnostic of drive
lineage, A, T, and G, C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after Sengar sequencing, we used the
bioinformatics pipelines to look for SNPs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in just whole genome sequencing
and genotyping by sequencing, and SNPs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are shared by both, and there were
around 23,000 for WGS and 1,000 for GBS
[SPEAKER_00]: and 545 for shared by both sequencing
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the summary of the comparison from WGS
and GBS, they were sorted according to
[SPEAKER_00]: subset of differences and similarities
based on ancestral lineage and drive
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage, and the proportion of SNPs were
calculated that were no longer fixed or
[SPEAKER_00]: for opposite alleles based on whole genome
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a total of 112 SNPs fixed
across opposite alleles according to GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are only 106 SNPs in WGS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there were a total of 112 SNPs
that were fixed in two groups according to
[SPEAKER_00]: GBS, but out of 112, there were,
out of 65 SNPs, there were 16 SNPs that
[SPEAKER_00]: were not informative due to low Sengar
power of GBS, which can be seen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: orange column that doesn't have any number
of alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a total of 106 SNPs that
60% were found to have both alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 80% showing an idle of the alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, this data shows that genotypes
detected by GBS were confirmed by whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequencing, which the inversion
might be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a future study, bio nanotechnics will
be used to map genome of selected brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bio nanotechnics are the technique
that do the whole genome restriction map
[SPEAKER_00]: to validate assembly or identify
structural variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the results, the result from
this bio nanotechnique, we might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to validate whether the inversion is in
the whole genome level or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: For conclusion, so the potato inversion
was detected by GBS and that was confirmed
[SPEAKER_00]: by whole WGS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was again validated using Sengar
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also learned the informative,
important bioinformatics technique that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be useful for modern and 21st
century breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for Dr. Gore and Dr. Elodi Gezave
and Nicholas Casmar for helping me for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for Dr. Skellen and Dr. Smart
for allowing me to present in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if there is an inversion in the
species, as I said before, there might be
[SPEAKER_00]: a recombination, but the products are not
recovered, which means it won't create the
[SPEAKER_00]: species that you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is problem for the readers where I'm
trying to make a new and better trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we did like multiple lineage
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions for you, June?
