[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see from my background,
I'm not a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I study atmospheric chemistry and climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for better or worse, sometimes one has
to cross disciplinary boundaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see the problem solved,
in other words, to look at ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions on a global scale in a
comprehensive Earth system model,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was no soil scientist or
biogeochemist or anyone that really wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to address this problem on global scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I begin, I should acknowledge
Stuart Riddick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Stuart was a postdoc here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He later left for University of Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he initially formulated much of this
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he formulated its structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Dan Ward, who's sitting in the
audience today, he's done a lot of work
[SPEAKER_03]: since Stuart left, getting the model in
shape and understanding how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both Stuart and Dan did a lot of the
actual work on this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before I begin, I thought I should list
here my questions that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: address in this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're probably different than many of
the talks you've heard in this seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is my series.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I work on the global scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm interested in climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the large-scale questions is,
how do fertilizer manure and ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions change the climate?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how will climate impact these
emissions?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do these emissions modify the nitrogen
cascade?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do the emissions change global
pollution and health?
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I'm interested in the global
scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the work I do is in model
simulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not experimental in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a picture of Paris,
March 14, 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this pollution event was attributed to
springtime fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very hot at that time in Paris.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the springtime when people
applied their fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it pretty much shut down the city for
a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cars could only drive on even or odd days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Public transportation was free.
[SPEAKER_03]: They decreased the driving speed limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trucks were routed around the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of this has been blamed on
fertilization and ammonia emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after introduction, I'm going to talk
about the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about some of the
nitty-gritty, get the results,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then conclusions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the background, as I'm sure many of
you are aware, that the nitrogen input
[SPEAKER_03]: into the Earth system has increased
dramatically in the 20th century and has
[SPEAKER_03]: increased really since Haber and Bosch
invented the process for making ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one can see this increase
especially here after about 1940.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this increase has been thought to
contribute to the large population
[SPEAKER_03]: increase over the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_03]: And incidentally, as I read a little bit
about Haber, Haber was also not only
[SPEAKER_03]: invented nitrogen, this process,
but he also is known as the father of
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical warfare.
[SPEAKER_03]: He invented a lot of chemical weapons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's an interesting character with
pluses for humanity and definitely some
[SPEAKER_03]: minuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going to happen in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the future, as the population
increase, the feeling is that the demand
[SPEAKER_03]: for nitrogen is also going to increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this shows a number of scenarios
for nitrogen fertilizer consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is ANSET 2100.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these scenarios are driven by
population growth, shown here in red,
[SPEAKER_03]: biofuels shown in green, and then
decreasing the emissions as efficiency in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, food equities increasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't quite know what's going to
happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the type of scenarios that
are used in climate models.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how the climate models work to
predict the future, is there's likely
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be an increase in nitrogen
fertilizer consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look in what's input into most
climate models, the ammonia emissions are
[SPEAKER_03]: like this, reflecting this increase in
nitrogen, but this neglects the impact of
[SPEAKER_03]: climate on the emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ammonia emissions are very sensitive to
climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you add the impact of climate,
then might guess that the ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions increase by almost a factor of
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this impact of agriculture and the
increase of nitrogen emissions is quite a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit different than what one expects from
industry and cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, almost all the scenarios expect
the other component or the main component
[SPEAKER_03]: of nitrogen input into the system to
decrease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is because already industrial
countries have decreased the amount of NOx
[SPEAKER_03]: emitted into the air for air pollution
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's expected that other countries
too, for example, China, will also follow
[SPEAKER_03]: along suit and decrease their emissions of
NOx into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the future, fertilizer is likely to
increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ammonia emissions due to fertilizer are
likely to increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And NOx emissions, are likely to decrease,
like that's the current thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a figure of the nitrogen
cascade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nitrogen is essentially put into the
system, largely into the farms in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also manure here and in terms of
combustion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is mostly in terms of NOx.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the nitrogen, so the ammonia emissions
from the farms are estimated to be about
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 teragrams per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nitrogen ammonia is evaporated off
from the farms and then is cascaded down
[SPEAKER_03]: in the nitrogen cascade and it lands on
forests, natural ecosystems, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to understand the nitrogen cascade,
to be able to simulate it, you have to get
[SPEAKER_03]: these ammonia emissions correct from the
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one can see that there are of greater
importance than the combustion emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're meant to increase in the
future, whereas these are meant to
[SPEAKER_03]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting these, getting ammonia
emissions correct is an important part of
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to simulate the future nitrogen
cascade.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does nitrogen do to climate?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this figure here, I showed the
radiative forcing of various species on
[SPEAKER_03]: the climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is essentially, you put these
species into the atmosphere and you look
[SPEAKER_03]: at the change in energy balance at the
Earth's surface due to these species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one can see that the change in energy
balance from pre-industrial to 2011 is
[SPEAKER_03]: estimated to be about 2.3 watts per meter
squared on the Earth's surface,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to this diagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is known as the radiative
forcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does nitrogen come into this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitrogen is a form of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's estimated that because the
nitrogen emissions have increased,
[SPEAKER_03]: that more CO2 has been uptaken by the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this has changed to radiative
forcing by between five and 10%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to all emissions associated with
fertilizer use, it's changed to radiative
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing by about 0.17.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nox emissions, through its atmospheric
count, by chemistry decreases methane and
[SPEAKER_03]: increases ozone, associated changes in
atmospheric forcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the ammonia emissions itself,
ammonia readily forms an aerosol in the
[SPEAKER_03]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aerosols tend to be reflective and this
has acted to cool the Earth's surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the nitrogen emissions have a lot of
climate effects from warming to cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably one of the most important
impacts is in the aerosols.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aerosols are particulates in the air that
essentially cool the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at various years,
so this goes from 2000 to 2100,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is from simulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's projected that by 2100 these
yellow line here, which is ammonia nitrate
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions, ammonia nitrate aerosols will
be the dominant aerosol species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now the dominant species is
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's projected that sulfur will decrease
as the air is cleaned up over China and
[SPEAKER_03]: other regions and that ammonia nitrates
will become the dominant aerosol type,
[SPEAKER_03]: which acts to cool the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: so in the beginning of the talk was input
of ammonia emissions into an Earth system
[SPEAKER_03]: model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be that some of you are not
really familiar with what we mean by an
[SPEAKER_03]: Earth system model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's kind of a timeline of how
they're developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 1896, 1900, using hand calculations,
Arrhenius predicted five to six degree
[SPEAKER_03]: warming for double CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it waited almost a century till
general circulation models were able to
[SPEAKER_03]: include double CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference between a hand
calculation and a general circulation
[SPEAKER_03]: model, larger model of the Earth and ocean
was they allowed feedback due to water
[SPEAKER_03]: vapor and clouds, although generally these
models got about the same result as
[SPEAKER_03]: Arrhenius got by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, okay, you can predict
the climate of the 20th century until you
[SPEAKER_03]: allow for the cooling due to aerosol
scattering.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were included in the late 1990s into
these models.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then around the early 2000,
the carbon cycle was incorporated,
[SPEAKER_03]: because if you add CO2 to the atmosphere,
it's taken up, about half of it's taken up
[SPEAKER_03]: by the ocean and the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this allows, if you want to include
a transient response, if you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: simulate the climate from now until 2100,
you need to incorporate carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you incorporate carbon cycle,
you need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nitrogen emissions were generally not
simulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ammonia emissions were generally not
simulated in these models, which is where
[SPEAKER_03]: the study comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm going to start talking about
the ammonia emission model in the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: of a Earth system model.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Earth system model is essentially,
it's a numerical model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's formulated as a number of grid
squares like here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they range in the horizontal and in the
vertical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each square here, each of these grid
squares, we have a model, a
[SPEAKER_03]: parameterization that simulates ammonia
emissions.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where, so this is how it fits
into this large scale model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the questions I remind you
of the questions I want to address from
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are global questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does ammonia emissions influence
climate?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is to take a, essentially a
process level model by extend it to global
[SPEAKER_03]: scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to do this, we have to simplify local
details to know the global simulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't put all the details in this
kind of model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the details are not available
globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to get details of crop
type, soil type, et cetera, fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: day, et cetera, globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the highly complex regional models are
not appropriate for global simulations
[SPEAKER_03]: because the global simulations were
simulating many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're simulating the ocean, the
atmosphere, aerosols, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to simplify the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to base this type of model in
physics and chemistry to the extent
[SPEAKER_03]: possible, because things that are based on
imperial parameterizations won't be
[SPEAKER_03]: sensitive to changes in temperatures,
changes in precipitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we base it on basic physics and
chemistry, then we think we can
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporate the changes due to
precipitation and changes in temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Modeling is an iterative procedure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important to remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked about modeling here at
Cornell, and many times people ask,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, it's too complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you simulate that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing to recognize is that,
OK, if you don't simulate it, it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can simulate it to 0th order,
and you have some idea of how it's going,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can improve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm interested in examining the
response of the emissions to force and
[SPEAKER_03]: changes in climate, temperature,
precipitation, and eventually changes in
[SPEAKER_03]: management processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incidentally, if anyone has any questions,
ask me as they go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just like to contrast the model I'm
going to present with a standard model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to most ammonia emissions in global
models are based on emission factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, you take the dairy cattle,
you take the kilogram nitrogen per head
[SPEAKER_03]: per year, you multiply it by the ammonia
loss, and you get a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you stick as your
emissions in the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And traditionally, these have been split
into one region, into two different
[SPEAKER_03]: regions, depending on whether the
agricultural practices were relevant for
[SPEAKER_03]: developed countries or developing
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the standard type of models people have
used to predict global nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: global ammonia emissions have not included
any dependence on temperature or rainfall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we do is we take a fertilizer
amount, or manure amount, and we know this
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been some studies publishing
nitrogen in fertilizer and nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_03]: manure globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we take this amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we feed it into a model for fertilizer
manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it can go three ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nitrogen in there can go to wash off
if it rains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can go into emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the emissions depend on the
meteorology.
[SPEAKER_03]: They depend on the wind speed and the
temperature and the surface roughness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they depend on the bandular turbulence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the nitrogen incorporated into
fertilizer and manure can go into the land
[SPEAKER_03]: model, which is another part of this
larger system model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within the land model, the nitrogen is
a portion to vegetation, to soil organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes up and it denitrifies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can go into leaching runoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can go into fires, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the base model that's already
incorporated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're adding this parameterization on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we need another important thing in
these large scale models is to conserve
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you add fertilizer, this is new
nitrogen created.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for manure, manure comes from nitrogen
that's eaten from the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have cows eat plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They excrete manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to take the carbon and
nitrogen out of the plants to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these type of models is very important
to conserve carbon and nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you want to look at how the
budgets change.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a cow for Stewart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stewart is Scottish, so I think it's a
Scottish cow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we've done, if we have a pool of
ammonical nitrogen here, as I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: this can wash off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can go to gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it can go into the land model to the
nitrogen pools here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fertilizer goes into this pool,
as does manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And manure is divided into three separate
pools, depending on how fast it's broken
[SPEAKER_03]: down by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, there's a cycle from the
land model back to the plants to conserve
[SPEAKER_03]: the carbon and nitrogen from the manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10, total ammonical nitrogen.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for fertilizer, it goes into a pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you add the fertilizer to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes into this pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This quickly decays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on the temperature,
how fast it decays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes into tan pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: For simplicity, we only apply the
fertilizer towards the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_03]: growing season when planting conditions
for corn are met.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is determined from meteorology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it gets warmer in the spring,
this fertilization application will occur
[SPEAKER_03]: warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Warm years will occur at different times
than cold years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And throughout, we don't consider
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't consider agricultural practices
in the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So agricultural management is going to
have to be added on at a later stage.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, it goes into three different
pools.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tan pool here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pools, these available, resistant,
unavailable decay at different rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They break down at different weight
grades, depending on temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one day for this available pool,
much longer for this resistant pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this unavailable pool essentially gets
incorporated into the soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: We assume the manure is spread on the
fields continually throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is a place where we
decided not to consider agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: practices, putting on the fields a few
times, or keeping the cattle in
[SPEAKER_03]: stockyards, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just assumed it was spread continually
onto the fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the tan pool, what goes on in
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: We essentially have an equation for the
ammonia gas that's in equilibrium within a
[SPEAKER_03]: water solution within this pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the gas depends on the amount of N in
this pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some rate constants below
it depends on the pH and some Henry's law
[SPEAKER_03]: rate constants as given here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it depends on the amount of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to predict the amount of water
also in this tan pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rate equations are such that the
gas, the amount of gas emitted increases
[SPEAKER_03]: exponentially with temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an exponential temperature
increase here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As this warms, it becomes less soluble to
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's more ammonia gas sitting right
on the boundary of the pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The emissions are essentially proportional
to the amount of gas sitting on the
[SPEAKER_03]: boundary of the tan pool minus the amount
in the atmosphere divided by some
[SPEAKER_03]: resistances.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we take the wash off from the
global news model, runoff from the tan
[SPEAKER_03]: pool, and then there's conversion from the
tan pool to the soil pool, which we simply
[SPEAKER_03]: account for as diffusion, either of
ammonium or nitrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have different diffusion
rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I talked about these
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on to the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a distribution from Potter et
al.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010 of nitrogen from manure and nitrogen
from fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one can see for both manure and
fertilizer, they are Europe, India,
[SPEAKER_03]: China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Midwest here are areas of heavy
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from manure, it brings in a
number of other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil here, Sub-Saharan Africa,
across this region here.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is used as input to the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we predict nitrogen emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 10-year average in the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, for the nitrogen emissions,
you can see these hot spots over India and
[SPEAKER_03]: China.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see hot spots here over this part
of Africa, India, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is because the emissions increase
exponentially with temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you warm the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get more fraction of the tan pool that
evaporates as emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are from
[SPEAKER_03]: the surface, but the units are kilograms
per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're surface emissions per unit area
per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we do is we account for a canopy
capture of the emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is we're looking at the emissions
from the land model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we connect it to the atmosphere,
then we'll be able to simulate how much
[SPEAKER_03]: goes up and how much goes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bidirectional flux of ammonia
that's very hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very hard to simulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we assume some canopy capture from
some numbers in the literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is one of the assumptions that
will be changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, again, you can see in these over
India, sub-Saharan Africa, where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: warm, a large percentage of the ammonia
and the emissions are released as ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: gas into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
OK.
OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, there are two things in your
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the database.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is one of the best databases
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they did is to combine this,
they counted animals in each country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they took information from FAO,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is the best, as far as I know,
database for fertilizer and animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, maybe it might not be correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is exactly one of the problems in
trying to apply these things globally is
[SPEAKER_03]: that we just don't have that good data.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So evaluation.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go over this pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because here, I'm showing some evaluations
from previous versions of the model,
[SPEAKER_03]: though I expect it will be similar in this
current version.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this shows manure emissions versus
model versus measure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the measurement, our score is 0.84.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the average amount percent evaporation
changes from 5% to 90%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one can tell this correlation between
the model and measurements is largely
[SPEAKER_03]: driven by this change in temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: When temperature is high, you get large
emissions of ammonia, as might be
[SPEAKER_03]: expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correlation with fertilizer is not as
good, but it's still significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, again, it's probably driven by
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've looked at different emissions of
fertilizer at different latitudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say, as this has already been
brought up, valuing ammonia emissions are
[SPEAKER_03]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: The concentrations are not
well-characterized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emissions are bidirectional.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be up and down, depending on the
time of day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ground-based measurements are challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're highly dependent on meteorology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the emissions are captured by the
canopy and describe a rather complex
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you make a model, you have to
evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But evaluation here is challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another way to evaluate a model is to
compare it against other emission
[SPEAKER_03]: inventories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in each of these diagrams is our
emission inventory.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most recent one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one which has come from a data
inversion.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another one which has developed
within the last four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a standard one used by global
atmospheric fathers.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are split between manure and
fertilization emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see that we, our emission
inventory, is about all of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: in fact, are about the same amount of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our split between ammonia emissions from
fertilizer and manure is a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: different than these two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We show more fertilizer, less manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's between this one and this one by
Edgar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we write right between.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say that all these inventories
here, it's a great deal of uncertainty on
[SPEAKER_03]: these global numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can look at different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is us, us, and us.
[SPEAKER_03]: China, notice that the scale is one,
is to 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Europe is to 4.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of the emission inventories predict
higher emissions in China than even over
[SPEAKER_03]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Europe, our emissions over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: are higher than these other inventories,
largely because we have larger fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with, and over Europe, where our
manure emissions are a little bit lower
[SPEAKER_03]: than some of these others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally, considering what we're
trying to do in this model, we're pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: pleased with these results.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're capturing the emissions within the
range of the other emission inventories,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there's a great deal there also.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we assume 50% of the nitrogen is from
urine, 50% from manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the manure piles have different
rates of breakdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, oops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so once the manure is in this tent
pool, then there are different ways it can
[SPEAKER_03]: go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can volatilize to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's competed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's washed out a lot, it won't
volatilize as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this shows the runoff from manure
and runoff from fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: One can see the runoff in these models.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as concentrated as one might expect
in regions of high application and in
[SPEAKER_03]: moist regions, Eastern U.S., Europe,
China, India, shown here, fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_03]: manure, and that's this percent runoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it's these regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: China, Europe has quite a high percent,
Eastern U.S., and this region and over
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil in both fertilizer and manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of the things that we can
use this model to do, is that in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future, as precipitation changes,
presumably these patterns of manure loss
[SPEAKER_03]: due to runoff will also change in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so this is surface runoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be additional runoff from
leaching once it gets, once the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: from there goes into soils, it can be
runoff first.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is sort of the...
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in another work, again, this is
preliminary results from Cindy Nevesen et
[SPEAKER_03]: al.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what she's doing is looking at
observed river export of nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_03]: rivers around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can also calculate this quantity in
the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the calculation is indirect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to know how the rivers run,
how much of the nitrogen in the rivers is
[SPEAKER_03]: denitrified.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one can see it's a way of bounding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another way of constraining these
type of parameterizations in earth system
[SPEAKER_03]: models by looking at the runoff in rivers
where it sure is pretty good data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Global fate of applied nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The emissions are globally just under 25%.
[SPEAKER_03]: The runoff is a little bit higher,
and most of it goes into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the manure, because the manure is
applied slowly throughout the year,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not applied as quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see there's less ammonia emissions,
less runoff, and more gets into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone looks at developing countries or
developed countries, developing countries
[SPEAKER_03]: tend to occur where it's warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that in developing
countries that the emissions, ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions, generally are higher than in
these developed countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is global, US, Europe, India,
China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see Europe, there's quite a,
in these calculations, there's quite a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: high ammonia emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this may have to do partly with when we
apply the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is largely temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we assume the soil, so it does have a
significance, but we assume so far it's
[SPEAKER_03]: seven, okay, because Stewart's assurance
assured me that the pH of manure is about
[SPEAKER_03]: seven, and a lot of soils are buffered to
be about pH of seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is, I mean, it is definitely
affected by soil pH, so we haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporated that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the losses implies most of the
nitrogen put up, that implies that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: the N-phase of the nitrogen from manure
fertilizers, the soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't mean it's increasing,
because so it can be lost from the soils
[SPEAKER_03]: either by leaching, by denitrification,
by forest fires, by other means,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a yearly increase,
it's just, where is it going once it's in
[SPEAKER_03]: the manure?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this green here is essentially
leaving our model, and then it can go into
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, it can be leached out,
a number of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then one advantage of models is
you can see what's happened over the last
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 years, and this is the case for global
manure, this amount applied, this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount going into soils, runoff,
and into emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see over time that the
amount going into soil has decreased,
[SPEAKER_03]: as the amount going into emissions and
runoff has increased over the last
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage wise, over 150 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: For fertilizer, we get quite a big
different picture, fertilizers added all
[SPEAKER_03]: at once, and in the beginning,
when very low amounts of fertilizer added,
[SPEAKER_03]: these calculations suggest that only a
little bit, most of it was incorporated
[SPEAKER_03]: into the soils, but as much larger
quantities were added very quickly,
[SPEAKER_03]: that less could be incorporated into
soils, and larger percentages were going
[SPEAKER_03]: into the air, as ammonia or into runoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sensitivities, we've looked at some of
them, I think in the interest of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't go over these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to briefly review future work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, agriculture management
practices are important and can impact the
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions fertilization dates,
spreading practices, feed yards,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is a view of Sutton et al.,
how one should do climate dependent
[SPEAKER_03]: ammonia emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them should be onto the fields,
as we did, some of it should be applied as
[SPEAKER_03]: manure, where you might use a
parameterization like ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it goes into unidirectional
emissions due to feed lots, and these
[SPEAKER_03]: should probably be parameterized
differently, because this is in a
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not immediately sensitive to
rainfall or the temperature outside,
[SPEAKER_03]: and these can be computed using emission
factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be quite a bit of work adding
more management practices, and even future
[SPEAKER_03]: management practices, into such a model to
see how emissions might change as a
[SPEAKER_03]: function of climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, once we get the emissions into
the atmosphere, then we can see what the
[SPEAKER_03]: atmosphere does, and in the atmosphere,
once we do that, there are many,
[SPEAKER_03]: many ways to evaluate the model,
many more ways to evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can evaluate against atmospheric
measurements, against satellite data,
[SPEAKER_03]: against wet deposition, against aerosol
data, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're eager to look at how emissions will
change in the changing world as the amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of manure and fertilizer probably
increases, as management practices change
[SPEAKER_03]: and as the climate changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The conclusion, ammonia is poorly modeled
in Earth system models, and I hope I made
[SPEAKER_03]: the case that there is importance in being
able to incorporate it in these models to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the impact of ammonia on climate,
but also there's an importance of looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at the impact of climate on ammonia
emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emissions are expected to increase as the
population grows, implications for
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen cascade, for formation of
aerosols, and there's implications,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I didn't talk about, for global
pollution and health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talked about climate-dependent global
parameterization of the emissions,
[SPEAKER_03]: responsive to temperature precipitation,
it has the ability to conserve nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon, and it suggests strong
geographical and diurnal temperature
[SPEAKER_03]: dependence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these I talked about, these are first
steps, and it can obviously, there are
[SPEAKER_03]: many improvements possible, and then there
are numerous applications to better
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the role of nitrogen as climate
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, if any of you have feedback,
I would very much appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, I'm not a soil scientist,
but I would very much appreciate any
[SPEAKER_03]: feedback from people who are in the field
or know how this type of parameterization
[SPEAKER_03]: could be improved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to have to run off to class
in just a few minutes, but thanks for your
[SPEAKER_03]: attention.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
