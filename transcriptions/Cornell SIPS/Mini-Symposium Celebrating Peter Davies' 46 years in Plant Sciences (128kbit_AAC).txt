[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_15]: And welcome to this symposium on Peter
Davies' contributions to Cornell over the
[SPEAKER_15]: last 46 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Fred Berringer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back in the last millennium.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a student with Peter.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was here from 1985 to 1990.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm delighted to be here today to help
him see this event.
[SPEAKER_15]: First thing I'd like to do is introduce
the chair of the section of plant biology,
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Karpatian.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a few words for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my job is to talk a little about
Peter and not to talk too long about
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a few notes myself to make sure I
covered every aspect of my interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: with Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew about Peter before I knew Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed him by a couple of years at Yale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I knew of his eminence in the area of
plant physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was delighted to meet him here when I
got to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter was then the chair of, or soon to
be, the chair of the plant biology
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds the same, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a smaller unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then knew Peter as a member of the
faculty of plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, I got to know Peter,
of course, as a colleague and a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to know that he had a remarkable
wife, Linda, who was an intellectual force
[SPEAKER_01]: in her own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to know that Peter was a heck of a
dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two extremely remarkable and
accomplished children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their accomplishments exceed those
that anyone could have rationally hoped
for in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still in awe of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On most of my colleagues, it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pressure on my kids on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Peter as a very interesting
teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has courage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a good and effective teacher in
plant physiology for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But toward the end of his plant physiology
teaching career, he introduced a course
[SPEAKER_01]: where he covered major events in biology
based on the popular press and on things
[SPEAKER_01]: that were happening at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat in on the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hoped to reintroduce the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very impressed by the courage Peter
exhibited in covering issues that are
[SPEAKER_01]: highly controversial at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was quite impressed by the guests and
the guest lecturers we had on the course,
[SPEAKER_01]: including one of my favorite old Yale
professors, who it turns out is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of Peter's, Dick Goldsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a nice thing about knowing
Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also knew Peter in a row as a wonderful
host and a fine colleague whom I liked
[SPEAKER_01]: very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think today we'll see that I'm not
the only one that shares that very
[SPEAKER_01]: positive view of Peter and his
contribution to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to turn it over to the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank everybody for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see quite a few familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's fair to say that all of
you have benefited from Peter in some way
[SPEAKER_15]: or another in your career.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's helped us learn and grow in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it was just that, I don't think
we'd have this seminar here today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it wasn't just how Peter helped us
with our careers and learning the
[SPEAKER_15]: profession.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the way he did.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the simple word for it was it was a
lot of fun to work with Peter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter brought a lot of energy and positive
thoughts to all the work that I did with
[SPEAKER_15]: him.
[SPEAKER_15]: He made it fun to work.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was open to new ideas and supported
trying new things.
[SPEAKER_15]: He did everything with a healthy dose of
humor.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think his hospitality to the people
who have come through his lab over the
[SPEAKER_15]: years is well met.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last thing is I know that he kept
the best interests in mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of all the people he worked with over the
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are my impressions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think you can share those as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's great control here as a way of
showing some gratitude to Peter for what
[SPEAKER_15]: he's done for our careers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also to be thankful for the way he's
been learning and collaborating on
[SPEAKER_15]: science, working the lab, and fun things
to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much, Peter.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to read a little bio about
Peter.
[SPEAKER_15]: So hang out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently, Peter got a very early head
start in plant biology when he took a
[SPEAKER_15]: class in high school, a Latin class in
high school.
[SPEAKER_15]: And his textbook at that time was by Ernst
and Daniels.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were two Cornell professors.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they had no small circumstances to
figure out after all these years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was at that point that he learned
about gibberels, which become a lifelong
[SPEAKER_15]: passion.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter was a member of the faculty of
Cornell for 46 and a half years and a full
[SPEAKER_15]: professor for 33 of those years.
[SPEAKER_15]: He retired this January with the title of
Professor of Plant Physiology and
[SPEAKER_15]: International Professor of Plant Biology.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter holds degrees from the University of
Reading in England, Bachelor of Science,
[SPEAKER_15]: Honors and Agricultural at Botany in 1962,
and a PhD in Agricultural Botany with an
[SPEAKER_15]: emphasis on herbicide physiology in 1966.
[SPEAKER_15]: In between that time, he earned a Masters
of Science in Plant Physiology at the
[SPEAKER_15]: University of Davis in 1964.
[SPEAKER_15]: Prior to coming to Cornell, Peter
post-doc'd with Mark Galston at the Yale
[SPEAKER_15]: University for three years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter's published over 100 papers on plant
hormones and several books and book
[SPEAKER_15]: chapters.
[SPEAKER_15]: At Cornell, he taught plant biology.
[SPEAKER_15]: He taught plant physiology his entire
career, reaching thousands of students who
[SPEAKER_15]: went on in the sciences and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: He also taught plant growth and
development with Dominic K.
[SPEAKER_15]: Law for many years.
[SPEAKER_15]: More recently, Peter started a public
course entitled Issues in Social Biology,
[SPEAKER_15]: covering societal implications and
advances in biology, and even more
[SPEAKER_15]: recently joined the GMO Debate,
Science and Society, a course on GMO
[SPEAKER_15]: props, the regulation of societal
implications.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter has had a long history of service to
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was the Chair of Plant Biology from
1992 to 1996, the Director of Graduate
[SPEAKER_15]: Studies from the field of botany from 1980
to 1983, Director of Undergraduate Studies
[SPEAKER_15]: in Plant Sciences, a major from 2014,
to 2009, and Chair of College of
[SPEAKER_15]: Agricultural and Life Sciences Faculty,
Senate, 2001, to 2004.
[SPEAKER_15]: He held a position of Jefferson Science
Fellow at the United States Department of
[SPEAKER_15]: State from 2011 to 2014, serving as a
science advisor in the area of
[SPEAKER_15]: agricultural biotechnology, and has been
involved in Cornell's mission of
[SPEAKER_15]: international agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: This symposium today reflects Peter's
long-term interest and contributions to
[SPEAKER_15]: the field of plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_15]: His more recent advocation for biotech
prop advocacy.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are delighted to have Jim Reed,
and Sarah Davidson, Evan Aga, and Ronnie
[SPEAKER_15]: Heron, all close collaborators of Peter's
over the years, to help honor Peter's
[SPEAKER_15]: career.
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I'd like to introduce our
first speaker.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was Professor Jim Reed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jim is a plant geneticist who has
identified genes that regulate plant
[SPEAKER_15]: hormones at this point in perception.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's shown how gibberolins,
brassinosteroids, oxen, and ethylene
[SPEAKER_15]: regulate plant development from molecular
to the whole plant level.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's currently working on the role of
plant hormones, the role plant hormones
[SPEAKER_15]: play in symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jim is an ISI, highly cited researcher,
former dean of science, engineering,
[SPEAKER_15]: and technology at the University of
Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a fellow of the Australian Academy of
Technological Sciences and Engineering.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jim has spent two sabbaticals here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was fortunate to be a student here
during one of those test knowledge
[SPEAKER_15]: holidays to work with Jim.
[SPEAKER_15]: But more importantly, Peter and Jim have
collaborated over the years and have made
[SPEAKER_15]: significant contributions to the field of
plant hormones and technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: So Jim, thank you very much for making the
trip here from Tasmania all the way down
[SPEAKER_15]: to the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_15]: The floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the title of Jim's talk is Hormones
and Plant Development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks very much, Fred.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely great to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks very much for the invitation
and the organization Sarah and Fred have
[SPEAKER_04]: gone to put on the show over these couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was asked to come, I was asked to
talk to a title something like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was to talk and give an up-to-date
version overview of where plant hormones
[SPEAKER_04]: are at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in thinking about it, I thought that
field is just huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just enormous.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way to give a contemporary
overview of that whole area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that I would actually focus a
little, instead of trying to cover the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole area, on areas and questions that
Peter had asked back in his early career.
[SPEAKER_04]: And try to show you how, over the last 30,
40 years, those questions have been
[SPEAKER_04]: answered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize if some of the data is a
few years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it will be quite up-to-date.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to actually address
the questions that Peter posed back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: 70s and see where they've come today and
whether they've been answered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter's been engaged with plant hormones
for a very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the conference in 1967.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's been working for 950 years on
plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Peter Davis there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably about mid-20s, early 20s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's been working in this area for a
very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to define three areas of
research which I think he made a critical
[SPEAKER_04]: contribution to over that very long
career.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are areas that I think are close to
his heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's worked extensively in these areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's really been at the forefront of
the field when some of the discoveries
[SPEAKER_04]: were made.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is perhaps an odd one for
somebody who put up, he's been a champion
[SPEAKER_04]: of hormone physiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say that because he influenced me
in the early days to be interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: hormone physiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's done that through being the
author and editor of key texts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a very long period of time to
enthuse people to actually get involved
[SPEAKER_04]: with the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at times, there's been a real need for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second area that I'll talk and
probably talk more about in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: length are the growth promoted hormones,
auctions, and gyrolons, the things he
[SPEAKER_04]: worked on and particularly their control
of the elongation, shooting elongation of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did early work where he identified
auctions and transport patterns and
[SPEAKER_04]: gyrolon metabolism and some of the gyrolon
intermediates in the biosynthesis in a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of key species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I probably should have said that
the first area is highlighted perhaps by
[SPEAKER_04]: this paper on regulation of high plants
with artboards from back in science in
[SPEAKER_04]: 1969.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this perhaps shows that he was
interested in this overview, because this
[SPEAKER_04]: was a really large review in science at
that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second one is highlighted by this
early review, the botanical review,
[SPEAKER_04]: about the current modes of action of
auctions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third area I'll talk about,
and Peter's made a major contribution
[SPEAKER_04]: with, is the genetic control developed,
the use of genes to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this particular case, it's about
apicals and essence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was before people started to work
on our adoptions and have all the modern
[SPEAKER_04]: species that we have today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may, again, appear, why are we
saying this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You assume that's the way people do
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that in the seventh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the key paper there is this
codoperiodic control of apicals and
[SPEAKER_04]: essence and genetic line of these,
which he did with Jerry Marks,
[SPEAKER_04]: who was a Geneva, perhaps mentor as a
geneticist, plant geneticist, and Bill
[SPEAKER_04]: Proving, one of his PhD students.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in each of these areas,
Peter's made a major contribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to show you how over the next
little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first involvement with Peter came,
as I said, through that first area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in 1970 with Art Galston,
presumably based upon that review in
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this came out in my final year as an
undergraduate student.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was introduced to the area
through this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we used it for a number of years in
our third year course in our teaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: More recently, he's produced these tests
on plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: The title's changed a little bit over the
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been various editions of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between 1987 and 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really the major graduate
level text, in my opinion, in the field
[SPEAKER_04]: over the last 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are chapters by the experts in the
field that have been invited to write this
[SPEAKER_04]: text.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter put it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see he's interested in Girellin,
because the molecule is on the front cover
[SPEAKER_04]: of photogallant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his involvement in genetics,
because here are some drawings,
[SPEAKER_04]: in this case, of various p-newtons that
affect Girellin bison.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the first time that Peter's
done this kind of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
He's done a lot of research.
He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'd like to show you over the
next little while is indeed they do,
[SPEAKER_04]: and show you that the evidence that was
put forward against them, and there were
[SPEAKER_04]: seven reasons given by Dwight was against
the role of plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the key ones are just shown here
in black, and they are the failure to
[SPEAKER_04]: correlate hormone levels with development,
failure to show localized sites of
[SPEAKER_04]: production, and the effects of the
environment on hormone levels were simply
[SPEAKER_04]: trivial.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, in fact, hormones really do exist in
plant E-Log and plant development,
[SPEAKER_04]: then we must be able to find evidence that
shows those statements are not correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I would like to show you is that
in working with Peter over the last 30
[SPEAKER_04]: years, we will see evidence that
contradicts each of those statements.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't go back to these statements,
so it might be wise just to remember them,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I hope that I can convince you these
criticisms that were there in the 1980s
[SPEAKER_04]: have been overcome, and Peter played a key
role in championing the role of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: hormones through the tests that he had
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: To move to the second section of the talk,
the growth and growth of hormones,
[SPEAKER_04]: auxin, gibberellons, and the ongation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where I've worked with Peter
and collaborated with him during some
[SPEAKER_04]: wonderful sabbaticals that we've had,
my family have had at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that he has had while he worked in our
lab back in Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used a range of techniques over the
years, in the early years of
[SPEAKER_04]: radiophysiology, plant physiology,
and the forward genetics approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the analytical techniques became
better, we used GCEL and LCLS techniques,
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course, the last 20 years,
the molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hope, again, I can show you that we
need all of these range of techniques if
[SPEAKER_04]: we're really going to understand plant
development from the molecular level right
[SPEAKER_04]: through to the whole plant level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why work on shooting ongation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why look at it as a process that we want
to understand?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope this graph gives you some idea
of why we thought it was an interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: area to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at yield in cereal crops,
look at those wheat crops, over the period
[SPEAKER_04]: from about 1963 to about 2000,
there's a very dramatic increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this increase in yield is obviously a
trigger to improve economic processes and
[SPEAKER_04]: a raft of other things at that level,
family practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the key thing was that the breeders
produced dwarf varieties, new dwarf
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that had substantially improved
yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used the genes, but they didn't know
what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was important to understand how
they're modifying our plants at the
[SPEAKER_04]: molecular level, and understanding
therefore being able to potentially use
[SPEAKER_04]: those same processes in other crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are the dwarf varieties so important?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lodging is a major agricultural
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lodging is when you get the crop,
heavy crop seeds on the top and the heads,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it falls over due to wind,
rain, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the dwarf varieties, especially with
good fertiliser application, lodge to a
[SPEAKER_04]: much lesser extent than full varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, if they're putting less
carbon into the stems, they can partition
[SPEAKER_04]: at greater proportion of carbon to the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've all heard of the Green
Revolution, and that's one of the key
[SPEAKER_04]: elements behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to understand what the genes
controlling height actually did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back in the early 80s, I started to
collect a whole range of dwarfing newtons,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was using peas as a model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did classify them into a range of
groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were ones that were short,
responded very well to the application of
[SPEAKER_04]: gibberellic acid, and I speculated that
they were GA fission newtons.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some that were elongated by
SLM, that responded very well to GA
[SPEAKER_04]: inhibitors, speculated they were GAO
producing plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were ones that were the same length,
elongated, didn't respond to the
[SPEAKER_04]: inhibitor, classified those as GA
constituent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And LA and CLY have subsequently been
shown to control what are known as the
[SPEAKER_04]: DELLA proteins, the production of DELLA
proteins, which are in the signal
[SPEAKER_04]: transduction pathway in gibberellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the fission newtons, recidivis
durellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are short, they're dwarf.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't respond well to GA.
[SPEAKER_04]: They respond very well to the application
of recidivis durellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have quite a discrete phenotype,
which they have their leaf colour,
[SPEAKER_04]: leaf shape, stem structure is different
from the gibberellum ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are all genes that have
subsequently been shown to control steps
[SPEAKER_04]: in the synesteroid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are ones that control the receptor,
the synesteroids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have other mutants that have a
short, bushy phenotype and are involved
[SPEAKER_04]: with auxin metabolism or auxin deception
in various ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could guess at what the mutants did,
but we needed to prove it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I take that first group,
the gibberellum biosynthesis mutants,
[SPEAKER_04]: here's the wild type.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Mendel's dwarf mutant that has
been used in the pea crop for at least 500
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a bunch of other ones that
control other steps in gibberellum
[SPEAKER_04]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to understand initially what
controlled this difference between
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendel's dwarf mutant and this wild type
mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apologize for this slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the first computer-generated
slide I ever had made.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I hope my taste has improved a
little since the calisthenics of those
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the literature of that time,
the explanation for how Mendel's gene was
[SPEAKER_04]: working was that it could affect
gibberellum levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could affect gibberellum sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be affecting auxin levels,
another growth motor hormone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be affecting the level of the
growth inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of the big difference you get
during de-insulation of the plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: it could be affecting photoreceptor
function, and particularly photocoron
[SPEAKER_04]: function.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these were the alternatives that were
in the literature in about 1982.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that stage, we knew the gibberellum
biosynthetic pathway were from geranyl,
[SPEAKER_04]: geranyl, and pyrophosphate through
on-carin, caranoid acid, GA-12,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then out through to GA-20.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was established.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter had worked on that and identified
some of the intermediates in that work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we didn't know anything more about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I want to talk about this little bit
at the end we added to this pathway and
[SPEAKER_04]: show that, in fact, these are the steps
that are controlled by Mendel's LE gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I'll talk a little bit about this
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question was, were the
gibberellums involved?
[SPEAKER_04]: Took the dwarf mutant, high GA-1 to it,
very rapid elongation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So GA-1 strongly promotes elongation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the precursor molecule, or the
molecule that was at the end of the null
[SPEAKER_04]: pathway at that stage, GA-20, would not
cause this elongation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biosahes, which is all we had at that
stage, suggested that the Mendel's mutant
[SPEAKER_04]: lacked a GA-1-like peak that was present
in the wild type, in fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started to be able to measure
the levels of the hormones using
[SPEAKER_04]: C13-labeled internal standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, we found that wild type had
about 13 nanograms per gram fresh weight
[SPEAKER_04]: of GA-1, and about a tenth of that in the
mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that suggested to us that instead of
the biosynthetic pathway coming through
[SPEAKER_04]: here, GA-20 can be deactivated by two
hydroxyls.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the hypothesis was that Mendel's gene
was blocking the mutant, was blocking this
[SPEAKER_04]: step.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we tried to apply radio-labeled GA-20
to the plants, and then looked at what was
[SPEAKER_04]: produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mutant GA-20 was produced just in
GA-29, whereas in the wild type,
[SPEAKER_04]: GA-20 not only went to GA-29, but it also,
GA-1 and GA-8 were also produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it suggested we had the right step.
[SPEAKER_04]: The question was, what was the mutant
doing?
This mutant could be just a regular gene,
could be in the structural gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to try and identify the gene
type of that lotus, and now we might do
[SPEAKER_04]: this, and we'd probably give the student a
month or so to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then, it wasn't quite so simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us many, many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Diane Lester, who was a post-doc in the
lab, at the time Peter was with us on
[SPEAKER_04]: Spanagal, Peter was on Spanagal back,
he was with us in 96, 97, and this is work
[SPEAKER_04]: that Diane headed up, that Peter was
working with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that stage, we isolated the three
off-stage gene by taking one of these
[SPEAKER_04]: three, and then showed that the mutation
in that gene co-segregated with Mendel's
[SPEAKER_04]: dwarf phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the parents, the dwarf has one
band, the dwarf has a mutation in it,
[SPEAKER_04]: which causes two bands, 2.2 and 1 kilobase
band, and then in a segregating F13
[SPEAKER_04]: progeny, and please, that takes about five
or six years to generate, we could show
[SPEAKER_04]: that all the dwarf types off-spring only
had the two bands, whereas the small ones
[SPEAKER_04]: either had three bands, about a
heterozygous, or just a single band,
[SPEAKER_04]: that were hundreds of bands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it suggested we'd actually found the
right gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: The final proof, of course, is showing
what that gene can do, and here's that
[SPEAKER_04]: gene, the wild type gene was expressed in
the coli, then with GA20, and indeed,
[SPEAKER_04]: the wild type gene caused it to convert
GA20 to GA1, but in Mendel's mutant,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was some activity, but only about a
tenth of the activity you found in the
[SPEAKER_04]: wild type.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mendel's LEG is a leaky, free oxidase
gene, and we had other mutants that,
[SPEAKER_04]: in case that were completely null,
for example, LE2, that are also mutants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, we've added this step to the
pathway, but nobody knew much about the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation of the deactivation,
and I'd like to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_04]: the SLM gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, here's the wild type,
seedlings, they elongate very rapidly,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we identify the appropriate gene,
and we vet GA1 in this case, we metabolize
[SPEAKER_04]: the GA8 in the wild type, but in the
mutant, the GA1 had no activity at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for the genes expressed in the
coli, and the reason I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: that this afternoon is that was the first
gene known to affect GAD activation,
[SPEAKER_04]: known to control the level of the
bioactive molecule by regulating its
[SPEAKER_04]: degradation rather than its biasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was an important step at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, we take it for granted,
we've just assumed those steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: The question really then became,
we took this SLM mutant, and crossed it to
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the duellian deficiency,
because this one, it's a very severe
[SPEAKER_04]: mutant, NA, what phenotype did we get?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this one is overproduced,
and this one has a block in the biases.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we produced the F2C and looked and
selected the double mutant, it was
[SPEAKER_04]: imbibigated just like the SLM type.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question was, how could that be?
[SPEAKER_04]: If this has a block in duellian
deficiency, in the biasynthesis,
[SPEAKER_04]: how can this be so problematic?
[SPEAKER_04]: The hypothesis we came up with was that
the NA mutation is site-specific in its
[SPEAKER_04]: action.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not block GA synthesis in your
maturing seeds, and therefore,
[SPEAKER_04]: these double mutant seeds contain plenty
of a GA20 when they mature, and on
[SPEAKER_04]: germination, that GA20 is metabolized to
GA1, which is the seed propagation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the case, which you get a quite
strong range phenotype when you grow on
[SPEAKER_04]: these plants for longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you did that, this is what you get,
the double mutant grows on, it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: elongated early on, but then the effect
from the GA carried over in the seed wears
[SPEAKER_04]: off, and you get this very short to mingle
NANA or speared wall phenotype towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: apex.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, we assumed that each of
these steps was controlled by one gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know anything about gene
families controlling steps in hormone
[SPEAKER_04]: bias.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we looked at the NA-like genes in
bees, we found here's the normal NA gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's expressed in the stem, but it's not
expressed in the developing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a second NA-like gene that is
not expressed in the stem, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: expressed heavily in the developing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That explains why the seeds could produce
GA, but the stem couldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I put it in today,
is because the NA seeds could produce GA,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you've learned the suggestion I
made in that first edition of that book
[SPEAKER_04]: that I published on plant hormones,
that genes controlling plant hormone
[SPEAKER_04]: biases can have a precise tissue and
auto-genetic specification.
[SPEAKER_04]: We now know that, we take it for granted,
most of the biosynthetic pathways that
[SPEAKER_04]: control plant hormones have gene families
controlling individual steps, and they
[SPEAKER_04]: quite often have quite specific sites of
action, or points at which they operate in
[SPEAKER_04]: the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why a small number of plant
hormones can control complex plant
[SPEAKER_04]: development quite precisely.
[SPEAKER_04]: This piece of evidence was important in
making that identification.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other hormone, growth hormone pair has
been interesting, right through his
[SPEAKER_04]: career, in the early 70s, was auxin,
and IAA, indole-3-acetic acid is a major
[SPEAKER_04]: auxin in most plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question was, if I'm saying GA-1
controls elongation, and Peter Fox would
[SPEAKER_04]: have said in the early 70s that auxin was
involved in elongation, how do they
[SPEAKER_04]: interact?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I want to describe is a little
bit of work by a colleague of mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: who worked in the lab at CODA for many
years, John Ross, and he came up with the
[SPEAKER_04]: hypothesis of how at least one way that
they may interact, one of the ways that
[SPEAKER_04]: they interact.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hypothesis was that auxin was being
produced in the area of the garden,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the young leaves, where it was loaded
onto the base pedal transport stream for
[SPEAKER_04]: auxin, and flows down the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that in the elongated end node,
auxin controls the level of GA-1 by
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing the conversion of GA-20 to
GA-1, and blocking the deactivation of
[SPEAKER_04]: GA-1 either from GA-1 to GA-8,
or the precursors from GA-20 to
[SPEAKER_04]: GA-3-acetic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he tried to test that hypothesis to
see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to just describe it as this
experiment that we need to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had three treatments, an intact plant,
plants where he decapitated just below the
[SPEAKER_04]: apex, plants where he decapitated,
and then a reapplied auxin inland on paste
[SPEAKER_04]: to the cut stump.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he measured the IAA level in those
tissues, and if he decapitated the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: the auxin level dramatically reduced,
and he put auxin back on the mat on paste.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you would expect, the level of GA was
elevated as a trigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: The question was, was there a subsequent
change also in the level of GA-1?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at this panel, you find almost
exactly the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you find here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supporting John's view that the change in
auxin level seen in these treatments are
[SPEAKER_04]: affecting GA-1 levels in the tissue,
or in the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that occurring?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you look at the two genes I
described earlier, the LE and SLN genes,
[SPEAKER_04]: the GA-3 oxidase and the GA-2 oxidase
genes, the intact plant, the LE,
[SPEAKER_04]: wild type, it's highly expressible.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you decapitate it, it's down-regulated
by auxin back, up-regulated, and a reverse
[SPEAKER_04]: happens for the deactivation gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's low in the intact plant, elevated
from the decapitated plant, and then goes
[SPEAKER_04]: back down when you apply auxin back to the
cut stump.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, GA-1, the doctor's
level, follows that pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point from that is that the two
growth hormones have been, a lot of work
[SPEAKER_04]: has been done in treating them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, they interact, and one is
operating through the other in that
[SPEAKER_04]: particular instance.
[SPEAKER_04]: The auxin is affecting GA-1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question that was posed by Tarabas
and posed by Theda over a long period of
[SPEAKER_04]: time was the interest in how light
controls elongation during de-insulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which hormones are involved?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the mid-1990s, it was considered to be
the recidivisteroids were posed to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that were involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it could be the gerones, but I'll try
to show you some results and show you that
[SPEAKER_04]: it isn't back to the gerones that are the
primary cause of this early change during
[SPEAKER_04]: de-insulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, how is the plant deceiving the
environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: What photoreceptor is involved?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll try to answer that question
tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, Tarabas suggested that the
environment didn't, or wasn't affected
[SPEAKER_04]: foregone levels to any great extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to show you that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got interested in that work when I was
here on study leave back in 1989 with
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Peter's lab at that time,
he had some wonderful transducers that
[SPEAKER_04]: could measure the change in plant growth
at very fine intervals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you could actually measure the
change in growth over those first two to
[SPEAKER_04]: four hours after exposure to red light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the dark, the plant's wobbling on
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in continuous red light, its growth
rate is reduced to about a quarter of that
[SPEAKER_04]: in the dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to know how that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I looked at, again, these same couple
of genes, the deactivation gene here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the dark, it's low, and it's elevated
within half an hour of transfer of light,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then stays up for a couple of hours,
and then drops back to normal after about
[SPEAKER_04]: four hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reverse happens for the Mendel's E
gene, the synthesis gene, it's high in the
[SPEAKER_04]: dark, and then half, and there's two dark
controls here just to make sure the safe
[SPEAKER_04]: light isn't causing a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: In half an hour, it drops down,
the exposure's light, and then gradually
[SPEAKER_04]: it goes back up to normal after about four
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a very rapid transcriptional
change over those first half hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean there's a change in GAE or
in the hormone moves?
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, you are at the hormone level
after four hours in red light,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the wild type plant here has dropped
to about one tenth of what it was in the
[SPEAKER_04]: dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we look at a five-prone B mutant,
the five B mutants, the difference is the
[SPEAKER_04]: same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in a five A mutant, the difference has
been removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no significant difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Suggesting that the environment is
affecting elongation, by being deceived by
[SPEAKER_04]: phytochrome A, and then that changes the
level of the GA1 hormone, which then
[SPEAKER_04]: results in a change in the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: So five A is the photoreceptor involved,
and the regulation of light by light is
[SPEAKER_04]: occurring transcriptional level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to show you this, if you're
interested in phytochromes, here's the
[SPEAKER_04]: cell in the Mansky photoreceptor cell,
here's the nucleus that's staying,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the same cell, and we're looking
here at phytochrome five A, been labeled
[SPEAKER_04]: in the monoclonal antibody, and in the
dark, it's in the round, dispersed through
[SPEAKER_04]: the cytoplasm, it's not in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_04]: After half an hour of red light,
it has formed into speckles and been
[SPEAKER_04]: transported into the nucleus, and
subsequently shown that that's part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: pathway for action.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the five A is degraded,
and it's nearly gone by four and a half
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the pattern of change in what's
happened to five A is completely
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent with those from other results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm talking probably too long,
but I was going to take these proven
[SPEAKER_04]: slides out yesterday until Peter told me
that he still wasn't absolutely convinced
[SPEAKER_04]: about how optimism is synthesized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he didn't necessarily believe all the
evidence that Peter had proven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back in 2009, one of the students in
the lab, had this diagram, there were at
[SPEAKER_04]: least five ways in which optimism is
proposed in biosynthesized,
[SPEAKER_04]: indole-3-acetic acid, from either indole
or tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the predominant pathway in the
literature at that time was through
[SPEAKER_04]: tryptamine and by-products of tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the proposal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was based upon the fact that the
younger genes, in our analysis,
[SPEAKER_04]: have been shown, or suggested,
to control the conversion of tryptamine to
[SPEAKER_04]: enohypoxytryptamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that came from work by Zal,
et al, in 2001 in Science, where they
[SPEAKER_04]: published that this is where the younger
genes were operating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a paper in May by the Clare
et al in 2010, also suggesting and
[SPEAKER_04]: providing evidence that this was the
pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we tried to have a bit of a look at
this and see whether it was the same in
[SPEAKER_04]: these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of our great students,
Nathan Sitherdale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he applied tryptamine, and he could
not find it getting metabolized in IO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Nathan was a good synthetic chemist
as well as being a plant physiologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he set out to actually make
enohypoxytryptamine, he synthesized it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and just looked at it as best he could.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he, this was the orthotic
enohypoxytryptamine, and he checked it by
[SPEAKER_04]: NMR, and when you look at it, it's a major
ion that fragments to 144.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at it, say you look at Clare
et al.
[SPEAKER_04]: paper, it is the fragment main ion,
and then it fragments it to give 106.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are clearly not the same compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the suggestion that we were getting
was, not only couldn't we find it being
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolized, tryptamine metabolized to
this compound, please, the spectra on
[SPEAKER_04]: which this hypothesis was based,
appeared to be incorrect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some excellent work by a couple of
major groups, molecular biology groups,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the following year, actually moved the
young genes from here over to this point,
[SPEAKER_04]: controlling the conversion of indole-free
pyruic acid to Ia, with the tryptophan,
[SPEAKER_04]: IpiA, Ia pathway being proposed as the
dominant pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's thought to be the
aeronautics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to, again, therefore check whether
this occurred in peas, our model,
[SPEAKER_04]: and John Ross, again, working in the lab,
collected genes that control this step,
[SPEAKER_04]: the first step in this pathway,
the fact of Ia, and he obtained mutants in
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to show you that indeed,
this is in developing seeds, and here in
[SPEAKER_04]: green is the wild type, and here is the
mutant in purple, and as you can see,
[SPEAKER_04]: indeed, mutation in that gene,
in that step, has a major effect on
[SPEAKER_04]: oxidant biocentes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a complication, because in peas,
seeds, the major oxidant is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_04]: a fluorinated compound, not just the
single Ia, but the same thing is happening
[SPEAKER_04]: for Ia, in fact, at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it indeed appears that the IpiA
pathway is the predominant pathway for
[SPEAKER_04]: oxidant biocentes, not only in some of the
models like aeronautics, but it certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: appears to be the case in leading such a
superior model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, enough about the growth of motor
hormone.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other area I'd like to talk about is
the use of genetics to study plant
[SPEAKER_04]: development.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a slide, just bring some
information from the literature over,
[SPEAKER_04]: a web of knowledge, and look at the number
of papers that were talking about plant
[SPEAKER_04]: mutants by their day, and how they were
controlling plant development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, back in the 50s and 60s,
it was a very, very small number.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so rare to connect, people didn't
use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it built during the 1970s,
and has rapidly expanded ever since,
[SPEAKER_04]: until these days, of course, we take it as
a matter of fact, but it's a technique of
[SPEAKER_04]: choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter and myself both started working back
in the 70s, when it was a relatively rare
[SPEAKER_04]: technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd just like to show you,
and this piece of information may only be
[SPEAKER_04]: of interest to Peter, but Peter and I,
during my PhD, I worked on flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: both of them were able to control
flowering, and Peter worked on genes
[SPEAKER_04]: controlling agents, in essence.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the end, it turned out that the genes
were exactly the same genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genes that control the photoperiod
response, whether it be the senescence or
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering of these, are these genes,
HR and SE.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a wild type plant, very similar to
a wild relative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It branches, has no related to senescence,
and it flowers very late.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you mutate HR, it becomes a branch,
it is reduced to a senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It occurs at an early age, you can't see
it here, and it flowers as a quantitative
[SPEAKER_04]: bomb day plant, or as this is almost a
qualitative bomb day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you mutate SN, the plant becomes
early flowering, day neutral, and it will
[SPEAKER_04]: only put on a couple of pods before
senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these were the genes that Peter and
a whole lot of people in his lab had
[SPEAKER_04]: worked on for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd all tried to work out what they
would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only really quite recently,
that we have actually been able to find
[SPEAKER_04]: this evidence out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is done by Jim Weller, one of my
former grad students, who's employed by
[SPEAKER_04]: David Hobart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were looking, he was looking and
tried to isolate the HR gene and see what
[SPEAKER_04]: it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he looked at the expression of
clock genes, this is called a KV clock
[SPEAKER_04]: gene, when he looked at the rhythms,
if you've got the rhythms of the wild
[SPEAKER_04]: type, on transfer to constant light,
the rhythm will keep going in constant
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the HR mutant, it's down to down
almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do the same thing and transfer it
onto constant light to constant dark,
[SPEAKER_04]: the rhythm in both types continues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So HR is needed to maintain the rhythm
under constant light.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he found that gene, isolated it,
he found it was an awful lot of an
[SPEAKER_04]: aerodopsis, it's a KV clock gene called
early flowering free.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he proved that, he proved that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we've got Columbia aerodopsis,
the L3 mutant in aerodopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here he's transformed those L3 mutants
with HR peas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, the wild type HR gene
compliments the mutant and they look just
[SPEAKER_04]: like Columbia wild type.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you transform the L3 mutant with an HR
mutant, then they maintain the speed of
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly demonstrating that he had the
right gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the previous genes that was
there to control photoperic response is
[SPEAKER_04]: the back of the L3 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually quite important because if
you look at photogenetics of peas going
[SPEAKER_04]: from wild relatives through the land races
in Afghanistan through to those that are
[SPEAKER_04]: in Mediterranean and Northern Europe
originally, you find that there's only a
[SPEAKER_04]: single mutation that's occurred in HR.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right across that range and that HR
mutant, that single hepatotype containing
[SPEAKER_04]: the HR mutation has become widespread and
is the key that has allowed peas to be
[SPEAKER_04]: adapted to spring sign in high level
genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is actually an important gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been fundamentally used in every
project.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other gene, I'll go through even more
briefly, that's the de-neutral gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: SM, the wild type, entangled with SM.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, what you find here is the
circadian rhythms have been modified by
[SPEAKER_04]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mutations in purple, and the rhythm has
been effected by bouncy sounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you go through the normal,
when you go through the process and
[SPEAKER_04]: isolate the gene by the SM, is the
ortholog of the aryptopsis top gene likes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those two genes that we're controlling,
and Peter worked on right through the 70s
[SPEAKER_04]: and 80s, about 80s and 80s, actually
control genes fundamental to the circadian
[SPEAKER_04]: rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that, now I'm getting a
bit more up to date with some of the more
[SPEAKER_04]: recent work I've been doing in the lab,
my interests in the last few years have
[SPEAKER_04]: moved to using the hormone genes that we
isolate and identify back through the 70s,
[SPEAKER_04]: 80s, 90s, to looking at how they affect
and using them to see how other hormonal
[SPEAKER_04]: processes are regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the NA gene I talked about,
in the roots of the NA gene, quite clearly
[SPEAKER_04]: the roots are smaller and shorter,
we expect that, but the nodulation is
[SPEAKER_04]: dramatically, it's almost eliminated,
showing that GAs are absolutely essential
[SPEAKER_04]: for some of the earliest ages in
nodulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also look at other myterisal,
other symbolises in plant groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, a buscule myterisal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, instead of being depressed as it was
in that last slide, in the NA mutant,
[SPEAKER_04]: the number of buscules to a higher heat is
significantly elevated, and that can be
[SPEAKER_04]: reduced or returned to normal by
application genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the tubulones play a key role in
regulating both nodulation and the buscule
[SPEAKER_04]: myterisal development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're operating in different
directions, so we presume they are not
[SPEAKER_04]: operating in the common pathway that
controls both of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't got time to go into it in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strigalactones, the most recently isolated
group in four months, it's worked out by
[SPEAKER_04]: Eloise Boone in my lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you take a mutant, a CCD-8 mutant,
it's just a mutant that lies in the
[SPEAKER_04]: pathway to the strigalactones,
they branch a few steps down the base,
[SPEAKER_04]: show they contain no strigalactones when
you measure them, you look at fundamental
[SPEAKER_04]: structures, substantially reduced buscule
myterisal development in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been known for a long time,
but that's not new.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly what is new is that they are
also affecting nodulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working on how the strigalactones
are affecting the communication between
[SPEAKER_04]: the mutant and the myterisal here,
and how that then results in different
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of nodulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's the work we're coming to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other mutants were just, I stayed recently
in these, it's been known and unspecified
[SPEAKER_04]: for some time, there's an Ion-2 ethylene
insensitivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, here's the wild
type, here's the Ion-2, nodules all over
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost supernodular, which is a
discrete phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it affects that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That had been determined by other people
in things like Medicado before.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we were interested in is how that
effect of ethylene interacted with things
[SPEAKER_04]: like some of our other homogenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, LK is a procynosteroid
deficient mutant because of blocking
[SPEAKER_04]: procynosteroid licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you get significant decline in
nodulation when you get rid of or reduce
[SPEAKER_04]: procynosteroids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you recombine it with the Ion-2,
you reduce the W.
[SPEAKER_04]: The implication is that you get an
elevation of nodulation back to what you
[SPEAKER_04]: see in the Ion-2 mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at that and try to work
out why, it's because this plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: the LK mutant, has elevated ethylene
levels, which would normally be hard in
[SPEAKER_04]: nodulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you introduce an ethylene
insensitivity, there's a difference
[SPEAKER_04]: between the LK and the wild type.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my current work is concentrating
really on how the root interacts with the
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosteum and how the hormones that we
looked at for a whole lot of other
[SPEAKER_04]: processes in the shoot, how they interact
to control that symbiosis development
[SPEAKER_04]: within the plant root.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is important to nutritional
gathering by the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: My rhizal development leads to increased
phosphorus uptake and the nodulation leads
[SPEAKER_04]: to increased nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're trying to piece together inside
the root how the plant hormones regulate
[SPEAKER_04]: these processes so that they are effective
for the plant and don't become parasitic,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't get to the point where too much
carbon has been lost to microalgae.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is a photograph taken in our
building in Hobart, where Peter was with
[SPEAKER_04]: us back in 1996, 1997.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the key people who have done
the experiments that I've been going
[SPEAKER_04]: through are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diane Lester did a lot of the molecular
work with the ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Ross did a lot of the auxil work I've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chetan Weller is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the work on the SNHR, the flowering
genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ian Mervitt is there, who was my mentor.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the person who collected together
some of the mutants that I worked on,
[SPEAKER_04]: the SNHR mutants that I worked on,
made that in my PhD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, he was my mentor in getting into the
use of genes and colouring them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chetan Well, if I go into the story,
he did sabbaticals with Barry Marks up at
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva and with Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: He met Peter at that time, and in fact,
Peter ended up being, I believe,
[SPEAKER_04]: my PhD examiner, which I, of course,
wasn't allowed to know at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were done conventionally,
but subsequently, obviously, now and
[SPEAKER_04]: there, many, many years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I've been so long engaged with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, there's been a huge number
of collaborators at UTAS, in our lab at
[SPEAKER_04]: UTAS, as well as people all around the
world, but particularly in this audience,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously, Peter Patop and Fred.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some absolutely great times out at
Kent State doing some work in Dan
[SPEAKER_04]: Cosgrove's lab while I was here over that
period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's been a great, I've enjoyed the
career and the work with Peter has been at
[SPEAKER_04]: the heart of a lot of those studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over those last 20 or 30 years,
and I thank him very much for his
[SPEAKER_04]: contributions and his name, and for
talking to people like me over that period
[SPEAKER_04]: of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I surely acknowledge the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly, my university's supported me over
a long period of time, and the Australian
[SPEAKER_04]: Research Council has been, just like you
already said, has been providing funding
[SPEAKER_04]: to allow us to do this work over many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you very much for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Jim, for that
whirlwind tour through the history of
[SPEAKER_15]: plant hormones, toxins, gibberellas,
bringing us up to speed with some of the
[SPEAKER_15]: latest developments in senescence and the
supernatant Williams.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are all topics that have been here
to people for many years.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that was a really great talk,
a very fitting presentation.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to take a break in a few
minutes, but if anybody has any questions,
[SPEAKER_15]: we'd be happy to entertain them in the
house.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just going to do a quick introduction.
[SPEAKER_17]: First person to really show the pathway of
auxin in roots, which is now central,
[SPEAKER_17]: and he also did auxin biosynthesis in
roots, my first undergraduate student,
[SPEAKER_17]: Eric Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you stand up, Eric, please?
[SPEAKER_17]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_17]: Eric is an MD, pathologist, but we nearly
got him to go with the plant sciences,
[SPEAKER_17]: but medicine called, right, Eric?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I actually did.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was another student that I
collaborated, and we decided that if I
[SPEAKER_15]: went into medicine and got the money,
we could start our own lives.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then I got married, and I was
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm probably not qualified to ask
questions about pathology.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I left, I was in the key model
organism, so I'm interested in hearing
[SPEAKER_15]: what work you've done with peas to
elucidate these mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of that work that I've done with
rhabiopsis as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a period of at least a decade
where the field was dominated by the
[SPEAKER_04]: molecular advantages of rhabiopsis,
so there's no doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, when we pulled out that GA3
oxidase gene, I talked about Mendel's
[SPEAKER_04]: gene, we would not have been able to pull
that gene out unless somebody had
[SPEAKER_04]: identified previously in rhabiopsis that
there was, in fact, a gene that controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: free oxidation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were able to pull that out,
so a lot with Jim Wells' work,
[SPEAKER_04]: the recent work there on the flowering
genes, as I said, they had already been
[SPEAKER_04]: identified as cloth genes in rhabiopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have a sequence for metacargo.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got the equivalent sequences out of
metacargo, and then pulled the sequences
[SPEAKER_04]: out of pea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the mutants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know what the gene structure
was, but he was able to prove it by
[SPEAKER_04]: actually going back and finding mutations
in the hominids out of peas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Arabidopsis, in terms of being able to
allow us to advance this molecular front,
[SPEAKER_04]: was fundamental for at least 10,
15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting to the stage now where we've
got enough other genome sequences that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can start to work from those species in
their own right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might ask, why do I work on symbiosis?
[SPEAKER_04]: What doesn't Arabidopsis do?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't form symbosis, so the obvious
reason if you want to stay working on your
[SPEAKER_04]: favourite model is to actually look at
developmental processes that are important
[SPEAKER_04]: in agriculture, an important developmental
process, but things that do not happen in
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you'd have to say that's why we're
now working in that area of my lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an area that you have to have the
mutants, and you have to be working on a
[SPEAKER_04]: species that has the symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lead units have been banned.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have both modulation and a buscule
mitilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, they are a really good model
for doing some of the basic work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's why we're where we are at one
point.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us are very attached to peas.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm working with peas, so it's good to see
that they're robustly used in the
[SPEAKER_15]: research.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of comments.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we have about 25 minutes or so to
ask from the freshmen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's take a break.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my pleasure now to introduce Sarah
Davidson-Giminega.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sarah came to Cornell after completing a B
.A.
[SPEAKER_15]: in biology from college and went on to
receive a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_15]: here in Cornell in 2009.
[SPEAKER_15]: For her dissertation, she conducted an
interdisciplinary study on plant molecular
[SPEAKER_15]: biology and science communication focused
on the controversy of genetically
[SPEAKER_15]: engineered papaya in developing countries,
focusing primarily on Thailand.
[SPEAKER_15]: She says, lured by the great weather here,
[SPEAKER_15]: plenty of water, and an unbeatable
intellectual environment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Who can argue with that?
[SPEAKER_15]: She remained in Cornell University after
completing her Ph.D., and she helped lead
[SPEAKER_15]: a global project at that time to protect
the world's environment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sarah now serves as a director for the
Cornell Alliance for Science, which is a
[SPEAKER_15]: global communications effort that promotes
evidence-based decision making in
[SPEAKER_15]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: She teaches courses in agriculture by a
technology graduate and undergraduate
[SPEAKER_15]: level.
[SPEAKER_15]: In addition, Sarah serves as a senior
associate director of international
[SPEAKER_15]: programs in the College of Agriculture and
Life Sciences, both an adjunct appointment
[SPEAKER_15]: in the section of plant reading and
genetics, and an integrated school in
[SPEAKER_15]: plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sarah was also instrumental in launching a
child's edition of AWARE, Advancing Women
[SPEAKER_15]: in Agriculture, through research and
education.
[SPEAKER_15]: Throughout her time here at Cornell,
Sarah's interacted with Peter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Her first time was as a grad student,
and Peter's plant growth regulator was a
[SPEAKER_15]: graduate level, module in the fall of
2001.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's gone on to work with Peter in
international programs as well,
[SPEAKER_15]: has contributed to lectures for Peter's
social issues and biology class,
[SPEAKER_15]: and she's also been on the faculty team
along with Peter and Ron Herrick that has
[SPEAKER_15]: explored the GMO.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sarah, with your common interest and
collaboration with Peter on his activities
[SPEAKER_15]: related to act-by-the-tech, policy and
public understanding, it's great to have
[SPEAKER_15]: you here today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Your talk is to see global aspects of
biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Fred.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an honor to be here and to be asked
to celebrate Peter's retirement in this
[SPEAKER_19]: capacity, and this is an area that Peter
and I share a real interest in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Peter has been a great mentor and source
of support for me, as Fred mentioned,
[SPEAKER_19]: for many years, and in many different
capacities.
[SPEAKER_19]: Both as a graduate student, he was always
that faculty member who made sure all the
[SPEAKER_19]: graduate students had a place to go for
Thanksgiving, invited us over to his home,
[SPEAKER_19]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_19]: That means a lot to graduate students,
and it's been an honor to teach with Peter
[SPEAKER_19]: in more recent years.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, of course, the remote
doesn't work, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and of course, he was also one of
our real supporters as a fellow graduate
[SPEAKER_19]: student involved.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I delayed procrastinating writing our
PhD thesis and launched a roller derby.
[SPEAKER_19]: Peter was one of our founding fans.
[SPEAKER_19]: Always a great pillar of support.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a little bit overwhelming and maybe
humbling to speak on this particular issue
[SPEAKER_19]: because Peter is probably one of the most,
well, one of the best people in the world
[SPEAKER_19]: to address this very topic, global aspects
of biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a little humbled, but I will launch
in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think many of you can appreciate that
genetically engineered crops are being
[SPEAKER_19]: grown around the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: 12% of the crop plan globally is zoned
with genetically engineered crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's about 10 crops that have been
commercialized and are out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Eight of them are grown in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: is the largest producer of genetically
engineered crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: We produce the most.
[SPEAKER_19]: Brazil follows, Argentina, India,
which Ron will probably talk a bit about
[SPEAKER_19]: today, and then Canada.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can see in this graph that many of you
may be familiar with, there's about 180
[SPEAKER_19]: million hectares zoned with genetically
engineered crops today in about 28
[SPEAKER_19]: different countries.
[SPEAKER_19]: And about five years ago, the number of
hectares grown in developing countries
[SPEAKER_19]: exceeded developed countries.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of those 18 million farmers growing
genetically engineered crops, the majority
[SPEAKER_19]: are farmers in developing countries.
[SPEAKER_19]: However, despite this widespread quality
of success of genetically engineered
[SPEAKER_19]: crops, there really aren't very many
genetically engineered crops out there in
[SPEAKER_19]: terms of diversity.
[SPEAKER_19]: So soybean comprises 50% of that
hectareage.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maize is 30%.
[SPEAKER_19]: Add in cotton in there at 95%.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you add canola, that comprises 99%
of the total of genetically engineered
[SPEAKER_19]: crops that are planted today.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what this suggests to me is that
there's a real lost opportunity to use
[SPEAKER_19]: these tools of plant science and plant
breeding to improve some of the important
[SPEAKER_19]: crops that are out there in terms of
security crops and highly nutritious
[SPEAKER_19]: crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: In a similar vein, two or three traits
have actually been deployed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So over half of the genetically engineered
crops that are cultivated are herbicide
[SPEAKER_19]: tolerance, round-up radius, as we commonly
hear it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other dominant trait is herbicide
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you combine those two traits
together, you have covered about close to
[SPEAKER_19]: 100% of the crops that are planted out
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, two little diversity of crops
that have been able to benefit from these
[SPEAKER_19]: tools and two few traits that are actually
in the hands of farmers.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the reason for the herbicide
tolerance in the last?
[SPEAKER_19]: They developed resistance.
[SPEAKER_19]: Overall, the number of hectares of
genetically engineered crops dipped this
[SPEAKER_19]: year for the first time from 2014 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, the herbicide tolerance
crops have developed resistance.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've heard a lot about the tolerance
of amaranth taking over cotton fields,
[SPEAKER_18]: for example.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that we've had the wine, you can jump
in all you want.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we had more wine, we can start to
debate whether or not to play hormones.
[SPEAKER_17]: That diagram on this graph is herbicide
tolerance only, insect resistance only,
[SPEAKER_17]: and more and more now are combining the
two.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is stack traits.
[SPEAKER_17]: That leads both together.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you'll see stack traits takes quite a
jump up as they have to go down.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's because they're growing the
combination much more.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or where there were price changes over
time, so a lot of corn mine went to wheat.
[SPEAKER_11]: So every year, farmers say, and we don't
have any genetically modified wheat.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think most people in our society
today know the reasons why we don't have
[SPEAKER_19]: more genetically engineered crops out
there than we have with farmers.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's been a lot of controversy around
this technology.
[SPEAKER_19]: And unlike the field of plant hormones,
not much has changed over the last decade
[SPEAKER_19]: or two in terms of conversations around ag
bio technology.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is despite that nearly every
highly reputable scientific organization
[SPEAKER_19]: in the world has endorsed the safety of
genetically engineered crops over and over
[SPEAKER_19]: again for several years.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not the least of which is the recent study
by the National Academy of Sciences that
[SPEAKER_19]: came out a couple of weeks ago that,
again, emphasized that there is no
[SPEAKER_19]: substantial evidence of the difference in
risks to human health between
[SPEAKER_19]: conventionally bred crops and genetically
engineered crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they did not find in this study any
conclusive cause and effect evidence of
[SPEAKER_19]: environmental problems from genetically
engineered crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: Even the Girl Scouts have taken a strong
stand for science on this issue when they
[SPEAKER_19]: were pressured a year and a half or so ago
to remove genetically engineered
[SPEAKER_19]: ingredients from their cookies that
they're so famous for.
[SPEAKER_19]: They took a stand and cited worldwide
scientific support for the safety of
[SPEAKER_19]: currently commercialized ingredients
derived from genetically modified
[SPEAKER_19]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they went on to say that in the
future, GMOs, they actually offer a way to
[SPEAKER_19]: help feed our ever-increasing population.
[SPEAKER_19]: There have been a few studies published
that have suggested that there are risks
[SPEAKER_19]: to genetically engineered crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the most famous of which is
the Cerolini study.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that study was retracted after it was
published in 2012.
[SPEAKER_19]: It got some play.
[SPEAKER_19]: It had major impact on some policy in
various countries around the world and
[SPEAKER_19]: then was later retracted.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it wasn't retracted before,
as I say, it had some pretty serious
[SPEAKER_19]: implications.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not the least of which was the effect it
had on policy making in Kenya,
[SPEAKER_19]: where there was a ban put into place on
the import of genetically engineered crops
[SPEAKER_19]: and genetically engineered food.
[SPEAKER_19]: And despite the fact that the Cerolini
paper has been retracted and there's a
[SPEAKER_19]: long list of ways in which it was blocked,
this ban remains in place.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's also had impact in countries like
Uganda, where it's like ActionAid that
[SPEAKER_19]: have been campaigning against the usage of
genetically engineered crops have cited
[SPEAKER_19]: this study and I will end it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I even go further.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm gonna play this.
[SPEAKER_02]: ActionAid is an international charity
raising tens of millions of pounds a year
[SPEAKER_02]: to alleviate poverty and end hunger.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Uganda, as a bill was being debated,
to allow GM crops, ActionAid Uganda ran
[SPEAKER_02]: this radio act for a week in 2013.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that genetically modified
organisms are organisms made in the
[SPEAKER_05]: laboratory by causing genes from different
species?
[SPEAKER_05]: Such products cause health risks,
such as cancer, infertility, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cancer in France was discredited by
the European Food Safety Authority.
[SPEAKER_03]: A different study suggesting a link to
infertility was withdrawn.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this gentleman in the red sweater is
the former director of Greenpeace UK.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, Greenpeace is an
organization that's campaigned against
[SPEAKER_19]: genetically engineered crops for a number
of years.
This message is brought to you by
ActionAid Uganda, protecting our health,
[SPEAKER_23]: environment, and farmers' right to seed.
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, that is really shocking.
[SPEAKER_23]: To be scam unbridled about health risks,
particularly cancer, with no scientific
[SPEAKER_23]: justification for me, that is totally
wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I share that example of a way which
the Seralini paper has had an impact on
[SPEAKER_19]: policy and decision making in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I also share it because I think it's
really encouraging that people like the
[SPEAKER_19]: former director of Greenpeace are actually
starting to come around and nuance their
[SPEAKER_19]: position on GM crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we're at a tipping point,
and we may be experiencing, uncharging up
[SPEAKER_19]: the ties, if you will, around the
conversation around GM crops globally.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm also encouraged by people like
this woman in this photograph,
[SPEAKER_19]: Matthea Chavrig from Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's the Minister of Agriculture there,
and she has stood very firm in her support
[SPEAKER_19]: of genetically engineered crops,
and ensuring that farmers in Bangladesh,
[SPEAKER_19]: one of the world's most vulnerable
countries, have access to this technology.
[SPEAKER_19]: So she pushed for the approval of B.T.
[SPEAKER_19]: Grinjal in 2013, and that material was
made available to farmers of a small group
[SPEAKER_19]: of farmers of about 20 farmers.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see that ceremony here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this gentleman, Mansur Sarkar,
was one of the first farmers, we go back
[SPEAKER_19]: to the first 20, who received the seed for
genetically engineered B.T.
[SPEAKER_19]: Grinjal.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the eggplant, as we call it here.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in 2014, he planted a small
quarter-hectare plot of this B.T.
[SPEAKER_19]: Grinjal, and was rewarded shortly
thereafter with a crop that he could then
[SPEAKER_19]: market as pesticide-free.
[SPEAKER_19]: B.T., of course, is the treat that reduces
insecticide use in these contexts.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in growing conventional eggplant,
he had to spray his crop twice a week,
[SPEAKER_19]: sometimes as much as twice a day,
under heavy investations.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now he doesn't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so he sees this both as an economic
benefit, as well as an environmental
[SPEAKER_19]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_19]: He and his wife and his daughters eat
eggplant two to three times per week.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the money that they earn from eggplant
helps them to support his family,
[SPEAKER_19]: and importantly, send his girls to school.
[SPEAKER_19]: His neighbor's eggplant, at this time,
I'm sure he has better seed now,
[SPEAKER_19]: but at this time, when the seed was
originally released, he was still growing
[SPEAKER_19]: conventional eggplant, and his crop was a
little bit pesky, which did not fit for
[SPEAKER_19]: sale for B.T.
[SPEAKER_19]: Grinjal.
[SPEAKER_19]: The rates here are pretty high.
[SPEAKER_19]: I planted the South Asia's first
genetically-engineered food crop.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was developed by public-sector
scientists and really intended for
[SPEAKER_19]: resource for farmers, like monsters are
hard.
[SPEAKER_19]: And his story, I think, is really
remarkable because it's a case where one
[SPEAKER_19]: single ag innovation and strong political
will on the part of the T.H.
[SPEAKER_19]: Haggerty have really offered him the
chance to greatly improve his livelihood
[SPEAKER_19]: and the lives of his daughters.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that can ultimately break their
poverty cycle.
[SPEAKER_19]: His story, however, should not be so
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the case of B.T.
[SPEAKER_19]: Grinjal that we all like to talk about and
celebrate should not be so exceptional.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a lot of products in the
pipeline in late stages of development
[SPEAKER_19]: that have been developed, not by the
monsantoes of the world, but by
[SPEAKER_19]: public-sector institutions in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: and around the world that are quite
promising.
[SPEAKER_19]: So products like biofortified vanilla and
bananas being developed in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_19]: Products like these nutrient-rich tomatoes
being developed by a public-sector
[SPEAKER_19]: institution in the U.K.
[SPEAKER_19]: Plant-dried fish oils being produced in
Kamalina, another project happening in the
[SPEAKER_19]: public sector in the U.K.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lake-like resistant potatoes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cold cows, so these are cows that have
been genetically changed to not grow
[SPEAKER_19]: horns, which eliminates the inhumane
process of de-horning.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this suggests it's a real animal
welfare issue.
[SPEAKER_19]: Insect-resistant cow pee, this is a major
food security crop in countries of West
[SPEAKER_19]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_19]: And biofortified or virus-resistant
cassava, to name just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's my hope that while we in this
country sit around the luxury of debating
[SPEAKER_19]: whether or not we want to label our foods
as containing GM or non-GM, this
[SPEAKER_19]: technology doesn't bypass farmers like
Janema.
[SPEAKER_19]: This cassava farmer in Uganda who in 2016
still struggles to cultivate a crop that
[SPEAKER_19]: is technically under domestication and
could use improvement with genetic tools.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's my hope that in four years or five
years I can be telling Janema's success
[SPEAKER_19]: story in which she's had the option to
choose whether or not she wants to grow
[SPEAKER_19]: genetically engineered crops and whether
she thinks this technology is something
[SPEAKER_19]: that will benefit her family.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that that choice isn't made by
organizations like ActionAid that are
[SPEAKER_19]: based in welfare countries like the U.K.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's also really important,
particularly in the context of Cornell,
[SPEAKER_19]: that we ensure that scientists around the
world have access to the tools that they
[SPEAKER_19]: need to innovate to meet the great
challenges that we face today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've seen what's happened with GM and
there's new tools coming along and we need
[SPEAKER_19]: to make sure that we don't lose access to
those tools as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need to make sure the public sector
scientists can use these tools to
[SPEAKER_19]: innovate.
[SPEAKER_19]: Scientists like Ellison Van Ettenen from
UC Davis who's been responsible for the
[SPEAKER_19]: old cat work that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_19]: Scientists like Chuck Maynard and Bill
Powell up the road at SUNY SF.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they've taken the gene from wheat and
moved it into chestnut to protect chestnut
[SPEAKER_19]: from the devastating blight that has for
the last hundred years or so decimated
[SPEAKER_19]: nearly every American chestnut tree on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're using this technique to
hopefully reintroduce a near extinct
[SPEAKER_19]: species into the forests of the eastern U
.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: Scientists like Tony Shelton, one of our
own entomologists here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_19]: who's using genetically engineered insects
to reduce pest populations for cabbage
[SPEAKER_19]: growers in New York state without the need
for excessive insecticides.
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, a real environmental benefit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Scientists like Andrew Coguna from the
National Agricultural Research Program in
[SPEAKER_19]: Uganda.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's taken a gene from sweet pepper to
protect his country's starchy banana
[SPEAKER_19]: staple, the Motoke banana, from bacterial
wild disease.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's scientists and farmers like these
who I've talked about in the first few
[SPEAKER_19]: minutes of my talk that have really
inspired us to build the Cornell Alliance
[SPEAKER_19]: for Science, the initiative that I
mentioned that we're leading there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And our mission really is to promote
access to scientific innovation.
[SPEAKER_19]: Access to choose to use these innovations
as a means of the canceling food security,
[SPEAKER_19]: improving environmental sustainability,
and really improving lives globally.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we think biotechnology is an important
part of that.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in our first year, we're a relatively
new organization, two years old,
[SPEAKER_19]: founded in 2014.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in our first year, we really focused
our efforts around this central pillar of
[SPEAKER_19]: access to innovation.
[SPEAKER_19]: But following the success of COP21,
we are now launching a new global dialogue
[SPEAKER_19]: around climate change.
[SPEAKER_19]: And central to this dialogue is helping
explore how this technology, or new
[SPEAKER_19]: precision-reading technologies that are
coming online, might help us mitigate and
[SPEAKER_19]: adapt to climate change.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we face a steep climate challenge that
of improving the environment, reducing
[SPEAKER_19]: poverty, and increasing food security,
while ensuring that the global temperature
[SPEAKER_19]: does not increase by more than 1.5 to 2
degrees.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's impossible if we don't make
major strides in agricultural innovation.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are out there in the world,
our communications team talking to
[SPEAKER_19]: farmers, to scientists, to consumers,
to policymakers about how they think this
[SPEAKER_19]: technology is playing a role in helping
them deal with climate change.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's some really interesting
stories out there, stories of adaptation,
[SPEAKER_19]: like the BT Rangel that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_19]: Water-efficient maize for Africa is
another great case.
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's also stories of mitigation,
so projects that are looking at developing
[SPEAKER_19]: nitrogen-reduced efficient crops or
methane-reducing rice.
[SPEAKER_19]: The other piece of this climate for change
initiative that we're leading is to
[SPEAKER_19]: continue to use our tools and training
programs to develop champions for change.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have two different training
approaches with the Alliance for Science.
[SPEAKER_19]: One is a 12-week program that happens here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_19]: Many of you probably met our inaugural
cohort when they came last year.
[SPEAKER_19]: These are champions from all kinds of
different walks of life, different
[SPEAKER_19]: countries, 10 countries who were
represented last year, who all feel
[SPEAKER_19]: passionate about this issue of ensuring
choice and access to improve modern ag
[SPEAKER_19]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they want to ensure that they can
bring that to their own countries.
[SPEAKER_19]: So who are these people?
[SPEAKER_19]: A few examples.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Reverend Father Noly Alparse.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was one of our fellows that came here
to Cornell last fall.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was a priest of the Roman Catholic
Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he came to this issue of biotechnology
when he asked himself the question,
[SPEAKER_19]: how can I expect people to come to church
on Sunday and praise and worship God when
[SPEAKER_19]: they're hungry and mired in poverty?
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Klet Mandvi Masiga from Uganda.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a sorghum breeder.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he was also one of our fellows last
year.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he asserts that every other field,
every professional field, is taking
[SPEAKER_19]: advantage of scientific advancements.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there should be no exception in plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_19]: So why is it that the tools plant breeders
have, the plant scientists have,
[SPEAKER_19]: are being so politicized?
[SPEAKER_19]: To the point where they aren't able to use
them to serve as farmers.
[SPEAKER_19]: For Joni Kamiya.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's the daughter of a farmer from
Hawaii, one of the first farmers to adopt
[SPEAKER_19]: the genetically engineered virus resistant
papaya that was developed here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_19]: And growing up, she saw firsthand how this
technology could positively impact small
[SPEAKER_19]: family farms like hers.
[SPEAKER_19]: And she wants to ensure that other small
family farms around the world can also
[SPEAKER_19]: benefit from this technology.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a sense of who our fellows are.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to show a short film about
them, I'm not sure if I have time.
[SPEAKER_19]: And your job in this film is not only to
enjoy it, but to try to find the Peter
[SPEAKER_19]: Davies cameo parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Father Noli Alparse.
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is James Foley.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Marla Assis from the Foley.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Vivian Tuey.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Jason Merkley.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Abut Modesta.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Nassim Mubuanya.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was studying in college,
I became an activist fighting
[SPEAKER_06]: dictatorship.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was with farmers and laborers and they
were so poor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kept on thinking, how could they help
these people?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really very painful when you see
families that cannot afford to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves at least three times a day.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's ironic.
[SPEAKER_22]: The farmers, the very people who till the
soil to produce food, are the same people
[SPEAKER_22]: who experience hunger.
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not just talking about American
consumers here that have nothing to eat.
[SPEAKER_24]: We're talking about people in food
insecure regions who have nothing to eat
[SPEAKER_24]: but a small handful of rice every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: My story is Demi's story.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's one of those small-holder Kasaba
farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kasaba, a major food security core,
is unafraid by two major viruses.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is very devastating.
[SPEAKER_21]: All the trees in Shantunga, all the
papayas had viruses in them.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's heartbreaking for them.
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, I was so scared, Joan,
I was so scared that we'd lose everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's traditional ways of fighting in my
country.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indeed, by technology, can you help to
solve some of these problems?
[SPEAKER_08]: And therefore, if this technology is
adopted by the families, I think it can
[SPEAKER_08]: help them reach them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's my firm conviction that it's a
fundamental right for farmers to have
[SPEAKER_05]: access to various farming options.
[SPEAKER_24]: It seems very cruel to deny that
technology to those people who are in such
[SPEAKER_24]: desperate need.
[SPEAKER_12]: Access to biotechnology is really a social
justice issue.
[SPEAKER_22]: Being a part of the first batch of cohorts
of the Grinnell Alliance for Science is
[SPEAKER_22]: truly a very rewarding experience.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a completely unique program,
as they say here in America, awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was really a science to
communication, and I knew that I needed to
[SPEAKER_12]: learn that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I found out about this program and
that opportunity to learn more about how
[SPEAKER_12]: to communicate science, I couldn't do
anything but jump at the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got interested in this program because
it was an avenue for me to improve my
[SPEAKER_00]: communication skills.
[SPEAKER_21]: My participation in this is hopefully to
empower me to speak up and get others to
[SPEAKER_21]: speak up in support of this.
[SPEAKER_22]: Interacting with experts, agrodermists,
scientists, farmers, policymakers,
[SPEAKER_22]: journalists.
[SPEAKER_22]: Commitment and dedication can actually
help someone get further and prove a
[SPEAKER_07]: point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's such a rich exchange of
knowledge and wisdom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the friendship will be coming like
brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_22]: I strongly believe that science can be a
key in solving hunger, malnutrition,
[SPEAKER_22]: and poverty.
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_22]: I cannot succeed on my own, always.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why I realized the need to unite,
the need to engage, and the need to
[SPEAKER_22]: empower a network of partners.
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, I really feel empowered.
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, I am more confident in engaging
the public with scientific undertakings.
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't fascination and discovery wonderful?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the best experiences that
I've ever had in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was the 2015 cohort.
[SPEAKER_19]: They went home in November.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we just selected and invited the 2016
cohort who will come here in August.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're coming from, there's 10 coming
from countries across Latin America,
[SPEAKER_19]: three fellows from China, and about 16
fellows coming from countries in
[SPEAKER_19]: sub-Saharan Africa.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hope that those of you who are on
campus will come out and meet them when
[SPEAKER_19]: they arrive.
[SPEAKER_19]: So since returning home, fellows like
Modesta Ugu, who you saw in the video,
[SPEAKER_19]: have gone home and they've recruited five
to six additional champions who share her
[SPEAKER_19]: mission of ensuring the Nigerian farmers
have access to biotechnology, access to
[SPEAKER_19]: choose this.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's recruited them into her initiative.
[SPEAKER_19]: These six champions then attended our
short course in Tanzania that we held in
[SPEAKER_19]: March.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they went home and recruited two,
three, four more people.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so you can see how very quickly
someone like Modesta becomes a very
[SPEAKER_19]: catalytic champion of change through this
program.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as the Alliance for Science here at
Cornell, we're really trying to engage
[SPEAKER_19]: individuals and organizations who share a
mission and want to extend and lend their
[SPEAKER_19]: voice to our global collective.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I encourage any of you who share
this mission and passion that Tater and I
[SPEAKER_19]: do to join our Alliance.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have now engaged people through our
efforts in over half of the world's
[SPEAKER_19]: countries.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we're really building
something that's important in ensuring
[SPEAKER_19]: that science and evidence guide decision
making globally.
[SPEAKER_19]: That said, the reality still is that too
few products have come out of the public
[SPEAKER_19]: sector.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're still dealing with that situation.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are only four crops that have been
approved using these tools.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, we like to talk about
Dennis and the kai that was developed here
[SPEAKER_19]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the only case where something has
come out of the US land grant system.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I hope that that will change because
this is really something that's consistent
[SPEAKER_19]: with our land grant mission.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think as scientists, it's really
important to step up and take a stand for
[SPEAKER_19]: science and not get run over by people who
are making a living spreading fear about
[SPEAKER_19]: biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need to invest in the research.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to invest in capacity building,
both in terms of scientists as well as
[SPEAKER_19]: communicators.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to engage with our communities.
[SPEAKER_19]: And hopefully, we can ultimately improve
the policy environments that will inspire
[SPEAKER_19]: a change in the conversation around
agri-technology.
[SPEAKER_19]: And ultimately, more of this technology in
the hands of farmers.
[SPEAKER_19]: So my appeal to you scientists in the room
is to really look up from the bench and
[SPEAKER_19]: realize that we need to do things
differently.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we sort of lost it on GM.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's all of these really exciting
transformational technologies coming down
[SPEAKER_19]: the pipeline that are here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we need to make sure that those don't
get demonized in the same way that GM has.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think this is where we can all get
inspiration from Peter because he's done a
[SPEAKER_19]: remarkable job in the last few years in
doing just this, both on campus,
[SPEAKER_19]: through his courses.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been said a few times today how much
impact he's had in wrestling with the
[SPEAKER_19]: tough issues with students here on campus
through the social issues and biology
[SPEAKER_19]: class and also the GMO debate.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also through his Jefferson Fellowship.
[SPEAKER_19]: And through his volunteer work after the
Jefferson Fellowship, he's really circled
[SPEAKER_19]: the globe from Latvia to Botswana to
India, helping people understand this
[SPEAKER_19]: technology so that they can make their own
informed science-based choices about
[SPEAKER_19]: whether it's good for their country or
not.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I take inspiration from Peter.
[SPEAKER_19]: I encourage you to join the Alliance.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I wouldn't be doing my job if I
didn't promote our new MOOC, Massive Open
[SPEAKER_19]: Online Course, that Ron and I have been
developing in connection with Patrice,
[SPEAKER_19]: Connective Technologies, who's here,
Rebecca Harrison, who's here in the third
[SPEAKER_19]: row, also members of the MOOC team.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a massive open online course
that we've been developing over several
[SPEAKER_19]: months that will launch September 13th.
[SPEAKER_19]: And anybody, anywhere in the world,
can take this Cornell course that has an
[SPEAKER_19]: internet connection and access to a
computer.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to play our trailer.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is going to be the perfect segue
to Ron's area.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oops.
Early in the 21st century, citizens of
planet Earth were distressed and anxious.
The problem?
What to think of the GMO?
The science?
The politics?
The clashing of values?
[SPEAKER_20]: Scary stories and grand promises compete.
[SPEAKER_20]: Contention swells.
[SPEAKER_20]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_20]: What are the risks?
[SPEAKER_20]: How is it responsible global citizen to
think about all this?
[SPEAKER_20]: The GMO MOOC team has come together from
different backgrounds, bringing different
[SPEAKER_20]: skills.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sarah, a scientist.
[SPEAKER_20]: David, a behavioral economist.
[SPEAKER_20]: Ron, a political scientist.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sharon, an information specialist.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Becca, a social scientist.
[SPEAKER_20]: They may not always see eye to eye,
but together they pledge to guide learners
[SPEAKER_20]: on the ultimate voyage of discovery.
[SPEAKER_20]: What is the GMO and why does it matter?
[SPEAKER_20]: Embark on this voyage of discovery and
share your views with others from around
[SPEAKER_20]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_20]: Learn how science works, the limits of
science, risk, human behavior,
[SPEAKER_20]: and how you can defeat the confusion in
your own life.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sign up now and let the Cornell GMO MOOC
team help you activate your own science.
[SPEAKER_20]: Enrollment of your own information
superpowers.
[SPEAKER_19]: Enrollment is open, so with that I will
turn it over to Ron.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
Thank you very much, Sarah.
That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just a quick introduction for Ron,
and we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron Herring is a professor of government,
an international professor of agriculture
[SPEAKER_15]: and rural development here at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's field research in South Asia and the
Central.
[SPEAKER_15]: I accepted farmer interests, class
politics, and urban policy.
[SPEAKER_15]: His first book was Man to the Tote,
The Political Economy of the Bering and
[SPEAKER_15]: the Forum in the South of Asia.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was published by the Yale University
Press.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was on responses, peasant movements for
social justice and health.
[SPEAKER_15]: Curiosity about GMOs was ignited by the
intense controversy around the tea crop in
[SPEAKER_15]: India.
[SPEAKER_15]: Farmer welfare, sustainability,
the crop played by a crisis in the lowest
[SPEAKER_15]: yields in the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: This research started to have a special
issue in the Journal of Development
[SPEAKER_15]: Studies, which is called Transgenics and
the Fourth Biotechnology Development
[SPEAKER_15]: Studies, published with the Forum on
Routage.
[SPEAKER_15]: This interest continued in his work.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was continued as editor of the Oxford
Handbook on Green Policies in Society in
[SPEAKER_15]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_15]: And with Robert Hallberg, the annual
review of a resource economics section of
[SPEAKER_15]: political economy and fire technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron is now working on his book manuscript,
entitled Suicide Seeds and Solar Bolts.
[SPEAKER_15]: With Peter's interest in public policy and
public perception of Dr. Jim Rose,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's very fitting that you're speaking
today.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you very much for contributing
to this symposium.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we do a handoff for the woman?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a real honor and privilege to be
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't told there would be molecules.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter and Sarah, as well as Shantu
Shantaram sitting right here, have helped
[SPEAKER_11]: me as a social scientist understand what
is a little bit more bizarre political
[SPEAKER_11]: phenomena in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the GMO debate.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you think about it, it's really very
interesting that there should be a debate
[SPEAKER_11]: about biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody asks, are you pro or anti?
[SPEAKER_11]: And students have decided to drop the
course, in part because all the profs are
[SPEAKER_11]: pro-GMO.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very bizarre thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You think about it, there's a course on,
like, I don't know, computer technology or
[SPEAKER_11]: cell phone technology or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people say, are you for it or are you
getting it?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very bizarre position.
[SPEAKER_11]: But Sarah and Peter and people like Shantu
often on Cornell campus have helped me as
[SPEAKER_11]: a social scientist understand this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, my position on this is kind of the
obverse of Sarah's.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah is a very hopeful person.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I cheer on her hopefulness and,
indeed, contribute periodically to being
[SPEAKER_11]: part of a hopeful campaign for farmer
choice, informed choice, and defeating
[SPEAKER_11]: misinformation that is contrary to public
good.
[SPEAKER_11]: All for all of those goals.
[SPEAKER_11]: I periodically write such things in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the other hand, I don't think the
picture is quite as rosy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to give the flip side.
[SPEAKER_11]: What Sarah told you about the advantages
and possibilities in science communication
[SPEAKER_11]: runs counter to a lot of what we know
about science communication and risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to talk more about the flip
side.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a benefit side to biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a discourse of risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that discourse is politically
powerful.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to plant politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hadn't thought about plant politics
much until I was asked to be part of this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's Michael Pollan, who really
thinks plants have politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Pollan wants to tell us that all
these plants have convinced human beings
[SPEAKER_11]: to give them special privileges,
politics as we get to what and how.
[SPEAKER_11]: So all of these plants have qualities like
smoothness, muting, intoxication.
[SPEAKER_11]: That have caused human beings to protect
them and invest in them and improve them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That, of course, he periodically backs off
from that because he knows a little bit of
[SPEAKER_11]: science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so he backs off and says, well,
actually, plants don't have much
[SPEAKER_11]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is the burden of a botany of
design.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in Michael Pollan's great question of
the battle between the trees and the
[SPEAKER_11]: grasses, the dominance of the earth,
is human beings that, of course,
[SPEAKER_11]: have intervened on the side of the grasses
to defeat the science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of the nature of the
development of nature on the planet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, plant politics, though, in Michael
Pollan's side, human beings do plant
[SPEAKER_11]: politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there have always been kind of demon
plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are dozens of such things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know you injected THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is the weed with roots in hell.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there have always been kind of a
classification of plants, a politics of
[SPEAKER_11]: categorization of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: As unacceptable or acceptable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, the British Empire
profited enormously by using opium as its
[SPEAKER_11]: progeny for control of much of Asia.
[SPEAKER_11]: But here, I want to point out,
I'm talking about the effects of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So both marijuana and opium have definable
effects that you may approve of or
[SPEAKER_11]: disapprove of.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have a new set of plant politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the new set, the gene chemo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an apocalyptic version.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by the way, Sarah talked about the
Alliance for Science.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually wearing the Alliance for
Science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm wearing a jacket because Peter,
every time I've seen him lecture,
[SPEAKER_11]: wears a jacket.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it would be underdressed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember the title.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, so this is the new plant
controversy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's important is that, unlike opium
or marijuana, the entire category of
[SPEAKER_11]: genomes, what is a genome anyway,
the entire category turns on how the plant
[SPEAKER_11]: got the traits it had.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the products of the plant or the
safety of the plant per se.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the process that produced it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And two of the most important elements
here, of course, are the hubris.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're playing God.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're shoving it down your throat,
which is the dimension of power.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the kind of opposition.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a biblical response to it in third
edition, by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, there's the darker side, which is an
attack on science.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is biotech genocide, Monsanto
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a list of Monsanto collaborators
who are targeted for death.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Nazi legacy of science
justification for murder.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a health ranger in natural
news.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that dichotomy of the natural and the
unnatural and the health ranger who
[SPEAKER_11]: watches out for dangerous things like
glyphosate is part of the discourse now.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, of course, the other kind of
critique that GMOs in the third world
[SPEAKER_11]: cause farmers to commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very, very powerful discourse
that it won't go away.
[SPEAKER_11]: It turns out that it's simply changing its
form, changing its shape, and this
[SPEAKER_11]: discourse of farmer disaster will not go
away.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's our university course.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we took this question on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's evolved over time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you see the different departments that
have sponsored this course.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we try to take on the GMO debate to
talk about science and society and how
[SPEAKER_11]: science is accepted in society.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the cost and benefits of
technological change?
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the core of the course.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the profs diverge in this course,
but the students may have noticed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter Davies says, people just don't
understand the science.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is his schtick with the state
department, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have got to understand the
science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he has huge amounts of science behind
him.
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, there's really nothing to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ron Herring says, it's not about the
science.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that the whole debate has more a
nation than the notion of truth in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not about facts.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about evidence.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about truthiness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this is a much stronger claim to make
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you realize what's happening to the
Republican Party in this country?
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone ever stopped to ask whether or
not Mexican immigration in the United
[SPEAKER_11]: States is increasing or decreasing?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's decreasing dramatically, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone ever asked this guy?
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I won't go on about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact is that the facticity has
completely disappeared.
[SPEAKER_11]: A majority of Republican primary voters
believe Barack Obama is not in the United
[SPEAKER_11]: States.
[SPEAKER_11]: 70% believe Muslims should be banned from
this country.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's an incredible amount of
truthiness substituting for facticity.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first kind of puzzle in politics is
why did RDNA crops become framed as a
[SPEAKER_11]: separate category in law, trade,
social movements, consumer behavior,
[SPEAKER_11]: international relations, or other
applications of the same technology we
[SPEAKER_11]: normalize to pharmaceuticals, vaccines,
industrial products, evaluated by product,
[SPEAKER_11]: not by process, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I want to claim here is the GMO
was a brilliant political invention.
[SPEAKER_11]: It loaded one concept with all of the risk
and disutilities that you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sarah mentioned some of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's sort of cancer, and there's
sterility, and an incredible number of
[SPEAKER_11]: things that GMOs cause, autism,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it excludes all of the clearly
definable benefits, such as higher farm
[SPEAKER_11]: yields, or it would come in to enable
pharmaceuticals for the product.
[SPEAKER_11]: So science and politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we know about politics?
[SPEAKER_11]: Science across the board is inherently
global.
[SPEAKER_11]: You think of global warming, classic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Science commits itself to tentative
conclusions.
[SPEAKER_11]: It won't give you a bumper sticker.
[SPEAKER_11]: The certainty of kind of bumper sticker
epistemology is restricted to the
[SPEAKER_11]: non-scientific community.
[SPEAKER_11]: Scientists are expensive, and scientists
are not disinterested, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Scientists disagree.
[SPEAKER_11]: The inevitability of fringe science.
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw Sarah Leany's work.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been tremendous.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you ask how many citations are there to
Sarah Leany's article about rats with
[SPEAKER_11]: tumors compared to Peter Davy's work on
plant hormones, I'll tell you a secret.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah Leany wins, hands down, by a huge
point.
[SPEAKER_11]: So scientists disagree.
[SPEAKER_11]: The inevitability of fringe science makes
it possible for people to say,
[SPEAKER_11]: well, not all scientists think global
warming is happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all scientists think global warming is
happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all scientists think it's humanly
induced.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, its policy makes kind of
impossible knowledge demands to disprove
[SPEAKER_11]: negatives.
[SPEAKER_11]: No scientist will tell you there cannot be
a black swan.
[SPEAKER_11]: No scientist is going to tell you no one
will ever discover an allergen in some
[SPEAKER_11]: transgene that was produced, that was put
into a crop in the fields.
[SPEAKER_11]: That cannot happen, simply because of the
nature of the epistemology of science.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're disadvantaged politically,
you know, the environment minister of
[SPEAKER_11]: India in turning down B.T.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brinjal said, I want absolute certainty
that nothing could go wrong with this
[SPEAKER_11]: plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, you could never have absolute
certainty in any scientific process.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, institutions are not
trusted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nina Federoff, as many of you know,
Nina Federoff said in her presidential
[SPEAKER_11]: address to AAAS that I am scared to death
of the anti-science movements all around
[SPEAKER_11]: the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the kind of worry about science
is sort of using people as guinea pigs,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That what we know is based on a knowledge
that is not complete.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every scientist, be honest, remit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not complete.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tentative.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tomorrow, a new study could show that we
were wrong about something.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this cute kid is not a scientific
experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this gets back to the Serenini study.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are also convinced that there are
thumbs on the scales, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That professional journals are edited by
people who are part of networks,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is true.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all part of networks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've edited two journals.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're part of networks in which we know
who we're sending papers to to get the
[SPEAKER_11]: response we want, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So peer review doesn't necessarily tell us
very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Serenini's work on raptors, which is total
rubbish.
[SPEAKER_11]: Total rubbish was peer review.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peer review journal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a high status journal, but a peer
review journal.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this goes, this is from the Herald and
Edinburgh a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Studies suggesting genetically modified
food killed rats has been suppressed by
[SPEAKER_11]: lobbying and multinational biotech
corporations in driving over campaigners'
[SPEAKER_11]: claims.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a thumb on the scale that
science is produced by the very
[SPEAKER_11]: corporations that benefit from the bad
science.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a widely shared view of how science
works.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's just think about this division I
made between green biotech, which is food,
[SPEAKER_11]: and red biotech, which is medicine,
pharmaceuticals, and vaccines into that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So look at the risk-utility balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Virtually all of technology change and
technology politics revolves around some
[SPEAKER_11]: balance between risk and utility.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to think about flying an
airplane for surgery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of those things, you would know the
risk, try to figure the risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the utilities, try to figure the
disutilities, and then you make a
[SPEAKER_11]: decision.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the risk in red biotech is balanced by
high utility.
[SPEAKER_11]: The doctor prescribes a drug, you may die
if you don't take it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The comparative safety of these drugs is
vetted by authoritative knowledge,
[SPEAKER_11]: certified experts that work between
certified organizations, state science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we have state scientists that trust
the FDA or they don't, but there's a state
[SPEAKER_11]: scientific process that affects certain
kinds of safety.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are voluntary acceptance of this
being an offense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike biotechnology in which what's
growing in the fields, whatever effects it
[SPEAKER_11]: has, you don't sign on voluntarily to be
part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't sign on voluntarily to consume
the food that's produced if it's not
[SPEAKER_11]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a kind of involuntary
subjection to risk, which we all know by
[SPEAKER_11]: scientific studies, it shows that people
will enhance their assessment of risk if
[SPEAKER_11]: they believe that they haven't signed on
to the risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: They voluntarily subjected themselves to
the risk, unlike drugs or surgery or air
[SPEAKER_11]: traffic, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so brain politics, biotech,
GMOs, it's a very different politics,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's quite variable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah presented this map after telling me
we should never use this map again.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is the map, so the world sort of
divided between GMO and non-GMO countries.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah gave you a nice overview of how few
crops there are, how few traits there are.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing she didn't say, well,
maybe she didn't say this, but one thing
[SPEAKER_11]: that people often miss is how little of
this is direct food crops, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly, mostly these crops are either for
fiber or feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have this remarkable thing where in
the EU, all of the farm animals that are
[SPEAKER_11]: used for consumption, all those animals
are fed GMOs, but somehow going through
[SPEAKER_11]: the gut of a pig removes the stigmata of
it being a GMO, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Even the euro is made from ET cotton.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's an odd kind of
transmogrification in the world of growing
[SPEAKER_11]: food crops that are transgenic,
genetically modified in some way,
[SPEAKER_11]: and the world of safety and non-risk,
and somehow animals stand between human
[SPEAKER_11]: beings and the crops that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But very little of this graph is food
crops for direct consumption.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brinjal in Bangladesh being a dramatic
example of an exception to that rule,
[SPEAKER_11]: since brinjals are eaten in Bengalis two
or three times a day often.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a major vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_11]: India is the second-largest producer of
brinjal in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are major vegetable crops,
but mostly biotech crops do not go into
[SPEAKER_11]: that kind of circuit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is sort of, when Sarah gave the
example from the US Academy of Science,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is a European study.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think in a way, it's good because
nobody trusts the Americans globally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody trusts Americans.
[SPEAKER_11]: Monsanto does the study.
[SPEAKER_11]: Monsanto has its finger on the scale.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a conclusion from the India
studies, a huge set of studies they funded
[SPEAKER_11]: themselves, meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just no difference in risk
profiles between transgenic plants or
[SPEAKER_11]: genetically engineered plants and any
other kind of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's important about that is that
tells us, going back to our earlier
[SPEAKER_11]: Vanuatu conference, the entire GMO debate
is a political debate.
[SPEAKER_11]: The entire classification is political.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no difference here except that
created by political entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no evidence of any difference
except that created by political
[SPEAKER_11]: entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not about the science,
it's about risk politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, think about the benefits side of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We said there's kind of an equation.
[SPEAKER_11]: The technology policy is risk,
there's a benefit, there's a regulator
[SPEAKER_11]: that weighs the risk and benefits besides
whether we can go forward or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about nuclear power.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very complicated risk benefit
calculations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about global warming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about Fukushima.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very complicated calculations on the risk
benefit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the benefit side of this operation,
the benefits to farmers have been quite
[SPEAKER_11]: obvious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every country where biotech crops have
been made available, they've been adopted
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, the dodging curve in India for
things like Bt cotton is just sort of 45
[SPEAKER_11]: degree angle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Astonishingly rapid adoption, down like
98% of Bt cotton in India.
[SPEAKER_11]: So farmers, they have a risk benefit
calculation too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But all adoption of cultivars involves
risk for farmers.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't adopt a new cultivar,
you're taking a risk as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So farmers are continually at risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the GM crops important to American
farmers are much less important to
[SPEAKER_11]: European farmers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you get this difference in the US and
Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because European farmers don't really
need, certainly not, Bt cotton.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't grow off of soy.
[SPEAKER_11]: The corn and rootworm doesn't show up very
much far north of Munich.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Spain and Portugal are heavy users of
Bt corn, but not much of northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have a different kind of utility
calculus.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're protected by government policy
that provides them with substantial,
[SPEAKER_11]: likely, independent market.
[SPEAKER_11]: And banning GMOs, of course, reduces
competition from America.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a different kind of benefit
matrix for European farmers compared to
[SPEAKER_11]: Americans.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the final point I want to make here
about farmer adoption is that farmers on
[SPEAKER_11]: every continent have taken very high risk
to grow illegal crops that are biotech,
[SPEAKER_11]: whenever the prices are too high,
sometimes the case, or access is
[SPEAKER_11]: restricted.
[SPEAKER_11]: So virtually all over the world,
you'll find instances of farmers taking up
[SPEAKER_11]: the technology.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an underground diffusion network
for biotech seeds, even when they're not
[SPEAKER_11]: approved by governments.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the benefit side of this equation is
pretty simple for farmers, producers,
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course, firms.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most firms have made money on these
products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all firms, they sometimes go out of
business, but the firms and farmers have
[SPEAKER_11]: some benefits.
[SPEAKER_11]: The risk, how do you calculate risk?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the hard part.
[SPEAKER_11]: Benefits are easy to measure, and they're
very clear to a farmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: The risk side of this equation is
completely politically determined.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's because of what we call an idea
of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you can't measure risk, or you don't
find any evidence of a specific hazard,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no specific hazard, and you can't
measure the risk precisely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you're in the world of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that uncertainty means that you have
to construct some kind of risk calculus,
[SPEAKER_11]: even though you have no hazard.
[SPEAKER_11]: As I mentioned with the EU studies,
there is no hazard demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_11]: So any kind of risk you have with regard
to GMOs is entirely anticipatory and
[SPEAKER_11]: hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, there's a explanation of variance and
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is classical political economy,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You weight the beneficiaries.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many farmers are they?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have organizations?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have access to the ministries?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have some political plan?
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you look at the opponents.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have large numbers?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have resources?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they mobilize a lot of people?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have media access?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they interact, and some kind of
vector sum comes out of a regulator,
[SPEAKER_11]: which we'll just call for now,
a government.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is critical, because part of the
variance around the world is explained by
[SPEAKER_11]: the character of this regulator,
that is the political structure of the
[SPEAKER_11]: evaluation of science.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the EU, you have multiple veto
points and multiple veto players.
[SPEAKER_11]: Public opinion about GMOs is about the
same in the US as it is in Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: In both countries, people are very
suspicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: A percentage of people say it's unnatural.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's roughly similar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody asks the questions in different
ways, so it's hard to compare public
[SPEAKER_11]: opinion surveys.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's not a huge amount of
difference across the EU and the United
[SPEAKER_11]: States.
[SPEAKER_11]: The difference is that very small numbers
in Europe can make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have multi-party governments in which
the Greens often have a Ministry of the
[SPEAKER_11]: Environment, or have at least a clout with
the Ministry of the Environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those coalition governments can be
blocked by the action of very small
[SPEAKER_11]: numbers of players.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's this regulator who is in charge
of agreeing between beneficiaries and
[SPEAKER_11]: opponents what kind of risk society should
take.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, empirically, around the world,
ministries that of agriculture have
[SPEAKER_11]: supported biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah gave the example of the Minister of
Agriculture in Bangladesh, supported BT
[SPEAKER_11]: Brinjal.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Indian BT Brinjal, from which they had
the same transgene, it's actually the same
[SPEAKER_11]: genetic event, the cry when they came out
of India, donated to Bangladesh,
[SPEAKER_11]: that very same gene was not approved in
India, and it was still put on moratorium
[SPEAKER_11]: in 2010.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still on the moratorium in 2016 now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because in India, the Minister of
Agriculture did not have say, the Prime
[SPEAKER_11]: Minister did not have say, the entire
decision was made by the Minister of
[SPEAKER_11]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ministries of Environment all over the
world are much more risk averse for
[SPEAKER_11]: reasonable reasons, but also because their
political constituency is environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: groups.
[SPEAKER_11]: The political constituency of agriculture
ministers is farmers, and farmers expect
[SPEAKER_11]: progress.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have a different kind of system
between those places where the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_11]: Agriculture dominates, and those places
where the Ministry of Environment
[SPEAKER_11]: dominates.
[SPEAKER_11]: India doesn't have BT Brinjal,
and Bangladesh does.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, since Sarah brought this up,
I do have to mention the hazards.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we say risk is hazard times
incidence, hazard time exposure.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hazards in India are very well
documented.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very well documented.
[SPEAKER_11]: The spraying of brinjals presents hazards
to both the consumers and to the people
[SPEAKER_11]: who are doing the spraying.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have evidence.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very clear that the current system of
producing brinjals is quite hazardous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I talked to some farmers in Maharashtra
two years ago, and I was asking about BT
[SPEAKER_11]: Brinjal, and they said, yeah, we spray two
or three times a week.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I looked kind of horrified.
[SPEAKER_11]: They said, but not up to five days before
harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because all of these bottles of poison say
do not spray within five days of harvest.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they said, oh, yes, up to the hour of
harvest if we have to.
[SPEAKER_11]: The worms are there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I looked horrified again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they saw my reaction.
[SPEAKER_11]: They said, oh, but we wouldn't feed this
to our families.
[SPEAKER_11]: This just goes to the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a genuine hazard involved in
the current use of current ways of growing
[SPEAKER_11]: brinjal that would be alleviated to a
large extent by growing BT Brinjal.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the regulator was, of course,
risk averse right then.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have already said this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason that science has a hard
time is Rumsfeld's unknown unknowns,
[SPEAKER_11]: the black swan phenomenon, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And in human behavior, we have tons of
evidence.
[SPEAKER_11]: Loss dominates gain, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're healthy, you walk into the
supermarket, you do not want to do
[SPEAKER_11]: anything that might cause some small,
no matter how small the risk, you don't
[SPEAKER_11]: want to take a risk if you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you get very powerful risk
politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the most impressive way is,
and science has no answer to this,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is no answer to uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't know, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give one example of this in the
vaccine debate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people that can read would know that
all of the official science says there's
[SPEAKER_11]: no risk of autism from a vaccine.
[SPEAKER_11]: But suppose there's a shadow of a doubt
suppose there's a tiny, tiny chance that
[SPEAKER_11]: the studies aren't adequate, that they
haven't done enough studies, and they'll
[SPEAKER_11]: change the studies next month.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have absolutely no risk in not
vaccinating your children so long as herd
[SPEAKER_11]: immunity is maintained in your area,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So if herd immunity is maintained,
even though you're free riding on
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody else's vaccinations,
there's no risk to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact that herd immunity is being
lost in many areas, and vaccination rates
[SPEAKER_11]: are declining, this indicates that this
risk discourse is very, very powerful,
[SPEAKER_11]: even though it's a tiny, tiny,
tiny, tiny risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: One other example that's interesting,
one of our former students did a study of
[SPEAKER_11]: raw milk consumption.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I said there are 13 more states
allowing raw milk consumption now than
[SPEAKER_11]: there were like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was kind of stunned by this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt we were getting more rather than
less health conscious, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: CDC has this big block capital,
do not treat raw milk.
[SPEAKER_11]: 90% of the illnesses from drinking milk
come from raw milk.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I asked this student who comes from a
dairy farm in California.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just asked her about her farm and
her feeling about raw milk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she said, this is terrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really horrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: All these people drinking raw milk.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, have you ever drunk any raw milk?
[SPEAKER_13]: She said, well, of course we all drink raw
milk on my farm, but it's my cow.
[SPEAKER_11]: So she trusts the raw milk at her farm,
just like the farmers at Great Brinchill
[SPEAKER_11]: that I talked to.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to use poison on the
brinjals that they eat.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to use poison on the
brinjals for the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mentioned cell phones early on.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a classic case.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no debate about safety of cell
phones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, from the time cell phones came
out, there has been a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_11]: debate.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from science, May 27th.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was last week or two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tumors in rats from cell phone radiation.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's non-dionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you think, how can there be tumors?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no one's quite sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the critical question here is,
and as usual, it comes with the caveat
[SPEAKER_11]: that studies of rodents can be neutral for
humans.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a rational person says, I don't care
how many rats you've killed with a
[SPEAKER_11]: transgenic crop and how many studies.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not apply very well to humans.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, a rat is not a very good
model for human physiology.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have this problem of cell phones.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've all adopted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody adopts cell phones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because utility is so high that even as
the risk goes up, people's risk-utility
[SPEAKER_11]: balance stays on the side of utility.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't see any campaigns against cell
phones.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no demands to label cell phones,
although in Scandinavia they do label them
[SPEAKER_11]: the awkward radiation.
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically, we've accepted the
risk-utility matrix for cell phones and we
[SPEAKER_11]: don't for GMO food.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what divides politics?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no single dimension.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is unusual for 20 studies of
international politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not variations of the North-South
pattern, developed underdeveloped,
[SPEAKER_11]: rich, poor, or democratic authoritarian.
[SPEAKER_11]: They cross all of those lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no dimension to this global rift,
unlike all the rest of international
[SPEAKER_11]: politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
risk politics in food.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've said there are a number of claims
about GMOs and their risk and benefits.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only about food, because we know from
prior to GMOs that pervasive anxiety about
[SPEAKER_11]: food drives politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a long-standing issue and it comes
up every year.
[SPEAKER_11]: The CDC once said 5,000 people a year die
of food safety infraction in the United
[SPEAKER_11]: States.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've reduced that to 3,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are epidemiological estimates.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody knows how good they are.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know lots of people die from problems
with food safety.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a distrust of institutions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, in the EU, this was
especially true after man-cow disease and
[SPEAKER_11]: several other catastrophes where state
science died wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's this capacious political
opening for risk entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have high anxiety and it's almost
impossible to convince people of safety,
[SPEAKER_11]: then you have a capacious political
opening for risk entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_11]: We rely on epistemic brokers.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is food bait.
[SPEAKER_11]: People know food bait?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So food bait, it's time to break free from
the toxins in your food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, food bait, she looks very friendly
for somebody who's taking toxins out of
[SPEAKER_11]: your food.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is what I call an epistemic
broker.
[SPEAKER_11]: People all over the world are in networks
looking for cues about who do you trust.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody out there reads cell or nature of
science.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what they're looking for is epistemic
brokers that they can get cues from that
[SPEAKER_11]: crystallize the information they need.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so here's an epistemic broker.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the food brokers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a science guy.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to trust him.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's a science guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: This kind of dingy, ill-lit room talking
to each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: Small crowds with some kind of cheesy
PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: He represents the Department of State.
[SPEAKER_11]: Goes around the world trying to convince
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: This looks kind of like a gray
bureaucratic group.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they really on the side of food
safety?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the broker number two,
and there are many like you things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here, what this is love the food bait
way.
[SPEAKER_11]: So who are you going to trust in this kind
of competition?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in social media networks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who are you going to follow?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to follow Peter the food
bait.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the food bait does very well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So does she.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the she's.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now her advantage is not being as
attractive as the food bait.
[SPEAKER_11]: Her advantage is that she claims to be a
scientist, which is not true.
[SPEAKER_11]: She has the advantage of indigeneity,
the authority that comes from indigeneity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Indian female woman right there amid some
kind of brain problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a different kind of episode
broker, but you'd be astonished how
[SPEAKER_11]: powerful she is.
[SPEAKER_11]: She gets $50,000 of lecture in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I being paid today?
[SPEAKER_11]: She's the one that tells us institutions.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is empirically evidence that the
perception of mass public perception of
[SPEAKER_11]: scientists is diverging a bit more than it
had before.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, scientists about global warming
and GMOs divergence has increased,
[SPEAKER_11]: and the public is less scientific than it
used to be relative to the scientific
[SPEAKER_11]: community.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the FDA, the power of Monsanto
dominates the FDA.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in fact, we can't trust anything the
FDA says.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, this incredibly powerful
campaign, this sweet kid, and he's being
[SPEAKER_11]: killed along with the bees.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's in a bee protest with a GMO for
killing all the bees.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a sweet picture.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't see his face.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so let me sum up the risk politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are very few general laws because
there's great volatility of time and place
[SPEAKER_11]: and population.
[SPEAKER_11]: If somebody had told me two years ago,
or even six months ago, that Donald Trump
[SPEAKER_11]: would be heading a major American
political party, I mean seriously,
[SPEAKER_11]: seriously, how can that happen?
[SPEAKER_11]: So politics is inherently unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_11]: But celebrity, predictably drives a lot of
politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: The food vein has this treatment.
[SPEAKER_11]: She has absolutely no background in
science, biology, food, anything,
[SPEAKER_11]: but she has this kind of presence.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a celebrity, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why isn't Paris Hilton important?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, she's a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is she a celebrity?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she's a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the Donald Trump phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this volatility of time and place means
we have no general laws.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to come up with a governing law
that makes any sense for politics.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do know that loss dominates gain.
[SPEAKER_11]: And secondly, this pervasive anxiety about
food just creates political openings.
[SPEAKER_11]: History matters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Compare nuclear power if you're doing a
risk benefit analysis pre and post
[SPEAKER_11]: Fukushima.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very different kind of analysis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or think about the Malthusian anxiety.
[SPEAKER_11]: No countries in the world oppose the Green
Revolution.
[SPEAKER_11]: Green Revolution plans to resolve world
hunger.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were sold on the grounds that we had a
Malthusian crisis.
[SPEAKER_11]: People were going to die of starvation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got public science involved,
a tremendous increase in productivity of
[SPEAKER_11]: our major food crops.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, 8,000 high-yielding varieties
were introduced, if you count all of them
[SPEAKER_11]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Huge numbers of improvements in plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that Malthusian anxiety, the benefit
of doing that overcame, there was no risk
[SPEAKER_11]: discourse.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why was there no risk discourse?
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no transnational organizations.
[SPEAKER_11]: The transnational advocacy organizations
did not exist at this time.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no Greenpeace.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no Friends of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: None of those people were in the political
game.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are now dominating the political game
in many places.
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, I don't know what happened to
my brain here, but I forgot the last
[SPEAKER_11]: point, which is that structure matters.
[SPEAKER_11]: So who these groups can approach,
where they have a chance to have
[SPEAKER_11]: influence, where the veto points are or
choke points are, varies from country to
[SPEAKER_11]: country, the transnational advocacy
networks have been tremendously effective
[SPEAKER_11]: at blocking biotechnology all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, please, so this is the
Greenpeace.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not lab rats.
[SPEAKER_11]: And every single sign is the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all middle-class people.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all in cities.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had a tremendous impact on what,
nine years of field tests, lab tests,
[SPEAKER_11]: scientific research, scientific consensus
about the Bt-Bringle, and we're good for
[SPEAKER_11]: farmers and good for health and the
environment, it was blocked.
[SPEAKER_11]: So think about this power.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greenpeace has been essentially
delegitimized in India.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been essentially thrown out of the
country in an important sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Cornell was blamed for this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm particularly blamed for the
Greenpeace.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so how might things change?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to get on a pessimistic note.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one way, here's our problem for how
things might change.
[SPEAKER_11]: Risk therapies are difficult to step out
of the garlic mustard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody here hold garlic mustard?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time you break off a stick,
it falls to the ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like Asian sink foil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So OK, so it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: These risk therapies will not go away.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Terminator gene hoax is still floating
around India.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was used in a high court decision in
the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not there, even after we knew that
farmers were underground taking this
[SPEAKER_11]: technology and pocket-free new varieties
of Bt-Cotton.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even after that, and even by Nishiba,
she's complaining about the failure of the
[SPEAKER_11]: government to stop all these farmers from
breeding new hybrids of Bt-Cotton,
[SPEAKER_11]: dozens of new hybrids of Bt-Cotton,
while talking about the Terminator gene.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do you breed new varieties when
plastic kills itself?
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so how might things change?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to wipe out these
theories.
[SPEAKER_11]: These narratives are very, very durable.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one quick story.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a book by Heath and Heath called
Make the Stick about how ideas are stuck
[SPEAKER_11]: in people's minds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have an example of the last
chapter.
[SPEAKER_11]: They said, how do you unstick a stuck
idea?
[SPEAKER_11]: And they said, actually, we have very few
examples.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah is working on the other side of
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah might be unsticking things.
[SPEAKER_11]: But on the other side of this,
they said, the only example they can come
[SPEAKER_11]: up with is Ray Kroc.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who read McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's the right name.
[SPEAKER_11]: He read McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was accused of having worms in his
hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_13]: How can he have such cheap hamburgers?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he puts worms in his hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ray Kroc does on TV.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he says, now here we have hamburgers,
39 cents a pound.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we have worms, night crawlers,
a button from a local bake shop,
[SPEAKER_13]: 2.99 pounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't afford to buy hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they said, that's an example of coming
unstuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: So me and his businessmen are out there to
make money.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray Kroc would not be grinding up night
crawlers to put into his hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So McDonald's went from there,
success to success.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is just a kind of a counter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I firmly believe in Sarah's areas.
[SPEAKER_11]: But how might things change?
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is my other example, the autism
business.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, this was also promoted by
someone like the food bake, Jenny
[SPEAKER_11]: McCarthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who was a playmate of the year,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this was also supported by
celebrities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Margellan's disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: The House of Representatives voted to give
a million dollars to CDC to investigate
[SPEAKER_11]: the disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an invention by a psychotic 17th
century Spanish physician.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are websites for Margellan's
disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: CDC said, this is a web hoax.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Congress said, we've got to spend
a million dollars investigating
[SPEAKER_11]: Margellan's disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a report.
[SPEAKER_11]: Margellan's disease says we can't find any
evidence for Margellan's disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just wasted a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the power of these kinds of narratives
should not be underestimated.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, if you think about it,
suppose you have this kind of narrative.
[SPEAKER_11]: Taking apart every piece of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, our Senate doesn't really own
our government.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't really poison our food
industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Taking that apart requires a kind of
activity which is so much more demanding
[SPEAKER_11]: than this bumper sticker.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe increase utility for consumers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So fill in your favorite pop game desire
of yours.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say you've got sugar without
calories or something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or game changing non-client applications
of biotech.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here, I think the combination of
climate change, which Sarah mentioned,
[SPEAKER_11]: and also non-client applications of
biotech may turn this corner.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Zika virus is kind of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Aedes aegypti carries four really,
really deadly diseases.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue,
and now the Zika.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can wipe that little mosquito out,
no great loss to the human race.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's invasive anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: You might have a game changer for
increasing a massive global benefit at the
[SPEAKER_11]: risk of getting rid of a pest.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, John.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just hurriedly switch from Sarah to
Ron.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to open up for any questions or
comments.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for those great talks.
[SPEAKER_15]: These are a person I think many of you
share with us.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very pressing problem for most of
us.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great to see people so passionate
trying to do something about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So kudos to you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any comments, questions?
[SPEAKER_15]: Randy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm neither prone nor congy about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I noticed that Sarah's slides were
labeled with Alliance for Science.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ron's t-shirt was labeled.
[SPEAKER_14]: I assume because you're proud of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Alliance for Science.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my feeling is to argue against
labeling.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to me, neither prone nor congy just
indicates a lack of pride for GMO foods.
[SPEAKER_19]: Labeling foods.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your argument, you're against labeling?
[SPEAKER_14]: So no, I'm actually for labeling because
it would show I'm proud of this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I think that's a really strong
argument for labeling.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's the best argument for
labeling, actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: That if this isn't something that we think
should be demonized, then label it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it can be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like pasteurized milk.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, I don't actually have a position
on labeling.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I struggle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: I struggle a little bit with it because
why would we label something as if it's
[SPEAKER_19]: dangerous when there's no scientific basis
that it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_19]: But on the other hand, I think that the
best thing we can do is label it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And people get over it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe they'll sell it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Why don't we do with pasteurized milk?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or slightly change your labels.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now you're saying instead of saying
contains GMO, which is kind of like got
[SPEAKER_15]: worms or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: You say contains high quality GMO
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Emphasizing that this isn't improved.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's saving the environment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Reducing pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you look at Arctic Apple,
for example, and I think V&A Potato also,
[SPEAKER_19]: they're really promoting and branding
their product as something special.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's GM and it's special.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're branding it as such.
[SPEAKER_11]: I support labeling for a different reason.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think it's going to create a
tremendous wave of inquiry and
[SPEAKER_11]: questioning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because every state government,
every municipality, everybody around the
[SPEAKER_11]: country with huge numbers of lawsuits,
the USDA has officially said you can't
[SPEAKER_11]: call things GMO-free because we don't
recognize the concept of GMO.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we have substantial equivalents.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think if you allow people to start
labeling things GMO-free, it's like the
[SPEAKER_11]: question of natural or unnatural.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are labeling things naturally.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think actually labeling is fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the negative fallout if you refuse
to label things is what are you hiding?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my feeling.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't see no downside to labeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: But within that, it's a matter of whether
it's mandatory or optional labeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you're making a mandatory
labeling of a process, that's only the
[SPEAKER_10]: only process we're requiring people to
label.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why aren't we saying, you know,
this was from radiation breeding?
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's singling out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be the only process that is forced
to be labeled.
[SPEAKER_10]: As opposed to Sarah's example,
it's optional labeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we still have the party couple to be
proud of it and then put that on their
[SPEAKER_10]: label that it's GE.
[SPEAKER_10]: But do we want the federal government to
say that this is the only process we're
[SPEAKER_10]: going to label on the way things are
labeled?
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we do like other things by how
they're made.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the sweatshop-free textiles,
fair trade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that federally mandated though?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's a marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: John, did you ever manage to succeed in
decaffeinating caffeine?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the problems about doing it
outside of a big company, which are always
[SPEAKER_09]: demonized, is that it's a big project.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started working with coffee,
and you have to have a transformation
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you develop your own, you have to
spend millions of dollars getting it all
[SPEAKER_09]: through regulatory apparatus.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want to fight from someone else.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, coffee doesn't work on a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then just everything is, you know,
raising enough money.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you go to Monsanto and say,
hey, you want to partner with us?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they go, well, how are we going to
make money on this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the trees grow forever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's all these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard for small companies to do
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the comments I wanted to make
is, and it came from this study that
[SPEAKER_09]: Florida State put out a while back from,
I forgot what the department was.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like the ag economics guys looking
to do a survey to figure out, well,
[SPEAKER_09]: how should we label things?
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things, and it turned out that
people don't understand anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things they asked about was
something like 33% of the people that they
[SPEAKER_09]: surveyed thought that vegetables did not
contain DNA.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the other questions,
80% of the people answered that every
[SPEAKER_09]: plant product that has DNA in it should be
labeled.
[SPEAKER_09]: 80%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I mean, I don't even know where to go
with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: What were these kids in the science class?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know what labeling does.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just one other quick comment I started
doing, working with genetically modified
[SPEAKER_09]: organisms really early on, like in the
mid-70s.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we saw the same thing in everything
back then.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can remember this guy named Jeremy
Ripton.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know whatever happened to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was against everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think when products came out in the
pharmaceutical industry after,
[SPEAKER_09]: and this went into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody's age parent was taking
something that, yeah, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that risk thing maybe goes to
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And other things like they came out with
some of the proteins factors for clotting
[SPEAKER_09]: that were completely GMO made.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a whole generation of hemophilics were
wiped out by AIDS because they were taking
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff from plasma.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think maybe you need something
like that to turn it around.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we thought maybe our coffee would if
we could have AIDS.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then 2008 came up and you couldn't raise a
dime anywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's a really difficult thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing that the papaya thing got
through, that they could do that on such a
[SPEAKER_09]: shoestring.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was before Jeremy Ripton.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was after.
[SPEAKER_09]: Way after.
[SPEAKER_09]: Way after.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a 70s.
[SPEAKER_19]: As a concept.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it was before the controversy.
[SPEAKER_19]: The papaya got through before GMO was a
household name and before Greenpeace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was still a lot of controversy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I spent 20 years at University of
Hawaii where the breeder that worked on
[SPEAKER_09]: the project, Richard Mansard, worked.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's worse than ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within the last six months or so.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just talking to someone whose father
grows papayas or brother grows papayas on
[SPEAKER_09]: the Big Island that were the transgenic
ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone came in and chopped all his plants
down one long weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: The situation in Hawaii is still there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a hotbed of growing GMOs
because Syngenta, Monsanto, Piner,
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody has laboratories there and
winter seed production there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also a hotbed of anti-GMO
sediment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess we're still left with a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other thoughts or comments?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a long time talking about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can talk about it over some
refreshments.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ron?
[SPEAKER_11]: I am now officially endowed with the power
to propose that we all go get something to
[SPEAKER_11]: drink and then we'll do a toast to Peter
Davies, who is the man of the hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
