[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things I've learned
most in my time as a student here is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: flexible and to adapt to changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no better example than two weeks ago
when we had the snowstorm and we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: reschedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for taking the time to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk about a lot that I've
been able to accomplish in my time here
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of collaborative work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing would turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're cooking with gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomatoes, we deal with a lot of
problems with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the direct problems with
the insects feeding, but often it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: result of transmission of diseases and
particularly viruses through those insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that causes a lot of the losses around the
world in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the current method of controlling
insects is often to use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a growing desire to make move
away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You develop resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one way that people are trying to
look for other sources of resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: insects is through the very diverse array
of secondary metabolites that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: in tomatoes, especially if you look in the
wild relatives or land races, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find some that have effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the compound I'm going to be talking
about today is acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are produced by a wide range of
solanaceous species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I'm going to talk about a
species of wild tomato called Solanum
[SPEAKER_00]: pinellii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds are feeding an
oviposition deterrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're exuded from the very tip of
glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here in tomato, you have the
type 4 non-functional trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some type 6 glandular trichomes
that has typically other compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the wild species, pinellii,
you have these droplets from the more
[SPEAKER_00]: dense type 4 glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little background on kind of the
chemistry of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure is generally a sucrose or
glucose backbone, to which you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: R groups here, which are fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are typically either 3 or 4 in
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can vary in length, orientation,
and location on the backbone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just an example of some of
the typical fatty acids that are attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sugars in pinellii, LA-716,
a particular accession of the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an LCMS profile of the typical
acyl compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the G stands for an acyl glucose,
glucose backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: S is an acyl sucrose backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 3 there indicates the number of
acyl groups, fatty acid groups that are
[SPEAKER_00]: attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number at the end is kind of the
total number of carbons that are in all
[SPEAKER_00]: those fatty acid groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the acyl sugars that are produced in
LA-716 are at very high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have a definite effect on a
number of insects, in particular white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies and thrips, which are major vectors
of viruses, and a number of other insects
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of breeding has been done by
Martha and in the lab for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that breeding led to the
development of a benchmark line that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces a moderate level of acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line is called CU071026.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has five integrations from the wild
species Solana pinellii, LA-716,
[SPEAKER_00]: the accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these acyl sugars of this line
demonstrate moderate control of white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies in field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really interesting thing we saw
from really starting to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry of these acyl sugars is that you
have a completely dissimilar profile
[SPEAKER_00]: between the benchmark line, which we
derived from the wild species and the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wild species, the accession we used
accumulates almost exclusively acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose backbone acyl sugars that have a
high proportion of a couple of fatty acids
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, iso-C4 and iso-C10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So branched fatty acids is the iso there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a 71026, on the other hand,
is exclusively acyl sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has kind of a different array of
fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are predominantly attached to the
acyl sucrose in that genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So completely different profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions obviously is,
do these differences in chemistry have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely that seemed to be the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a recent study is really showing that,
remarkably, you have differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy when you use purified acyl sugars
washed off of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the effect for both white
flies and some thrips in their desire or
[SPEAKER_00]: their probability of ovipositing,
you see differences between a 71026 and
[SPEAKER_00]: several of the wild pinellii accessions at
reducing the probability of oviposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, for these two insects,
you see this difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at another insect,
the tobacco thrips, all acyl sugars appear
[SPEAKER_00]: to be fairly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just all insects react the
same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems some insects respond more to the
chemistry changes and other insects
[SPEAKER_00]: respond differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the really interesting things that
came out of this paper, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that when you fractionate the acyl
sugars of one accession, LA1376,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was one of the more effective
accessions, when you fractionate them into
[SPEAKER_00]: less polar and more polar fractions,
the fractions on their own are less
[SPEAKER_00]: effective than when you combine them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an evidence of synergy
from the different fractions of the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way the acyl sugars kind of break
down is the less polar fraction is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally more of the acyl glucoses and
the more polar is more of the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more differences than just
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you combine them together,
the idea is you have synergy of these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the work that's the basis of
my time here is really working with
[SPEAKER_00]: previously identified QTL that affect the
chemistry of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some QTL, for example, that affect acyl
sugar level, or is not really the focus of
[SPEAKER_00]: my work, but QTL that affect fatty acid
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these in particular are ones that
I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also QTL that affect the
acyl sugar moiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you have acyl sucroses or acyl
glucoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good source for a number of these
QTL that I used during my time here is
[SPEAKER_00]: these Amir mono-integression lines that
have snippets of Solano-Panellii LA716 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background of a processing tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easier to transfer the QTL than working
directly with the wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an outline I want to be going
through today is talking about how I use a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of these QTL that affect acyl sugar
chemistry, including three of them that
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So affecting the orientation, length,
et cetera, the fatty acids that are part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three QTL that affect shifting
from acyl sucrose to acyl glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine mapping those QTL to help elucidate
gene candidates for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a very broad spectrum
characterization of the single and
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple QTL lines for acyl sugar level
and chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously some really exciting
stuff that I want to talk about today is
[SPEAKER_00]: testing of some of these lines against
insects and bioassays and field trials to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what effect the chemistry has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, a little bit of a
summary about how we can help elucidate
[SPEAKER_00]: structure-function relationships between
these compounds and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ultimate goal of creating lines
and hybrids that have kind of an optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sugar chemistry may be targeted for
specific insects or particular locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first QTL I'll talk about today is
one that affects fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was previously intergressed to the
presence of the five intergressions of
[SPEAKER_00]: CuO7 and CuO6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of need those five
intergressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a certain level of acyl sugar
and then we transfer this QTL into change
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS indicated that this QTL affects the
proportion of these two fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: IsoC11 and IsoC13 branched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the process of breeding with
this QTL, we saw some segregation for acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar level and a leaf morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of straighten that out and we
selected a line called FA2AS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the region that the QTL is contained
within is now down to about 1.4 megabase
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some gene candidates for that
region, but I won't go into that right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to summarize here kind of the
effect of this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is LCMS chromatogram, so looking at
the whole acyl sugars that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers in parentheses are,
so this is an acyl sugar, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a two-carbon fatty acid,
a five-carbon, a five-carbon, and a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10-carbon fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four fatty acids that are attached to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all acyl sucruses,
so there's no S or G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see when you compare the fatty
acid two line to the benchmark of 71026,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see these arrows demonstrate the
either novel addition or upregulation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of acyl sugars that contain 11 and
13-carbon fatty acids, which are likely
[SPEAKER_00]: the IsoC11 and IsoC13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the LCMS doesn't tell you the
orientation of those fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use a combination of GCMS
and LCMS to help us determine exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next QTL that I worked with was IL,
or fatty acid seven, which we identified
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in IL7-4-1, one of the Zemir
integration lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought that into the presence of the
five integrations of CU071026.
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS indicated this increased the amount
of straight-chain C10 that was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this led to the selection of a line
FA7AS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here when you compare the
chromatograms, again, you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulation of two acyl sugars that have
these C10 compounds, which is likely the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight-chain C10 compared to the
benchmark line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine mapping in some populations using
this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the bars here represent
tomato allele, the gray is heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this area is kind of a recombination
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do not have the pinellia
allele here, you have very low levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: straight-chain C10 fatty acids,
kind of the same as those 71026.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're heterozygous for it,
you get up to maybe four to six percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see that we can use these
recombinants, and we use some marker
[SPEAKER_00]: information, a combination of CAPS markers
and some GBS data to help reduce this
[SPEAKER_00]: integration from a very large size in the
IL line down to about three megabase
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no known genes in this
region implicated for acyl sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis, so this line and germplasm
related to this could really be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: help identify a gene or genes involved in
acyl sugar biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next fatty acid QTL I'll talk about is
fatty acid 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, again, identified in a
mono-integration line, the source being
[SPEAKER_00]: IL8-1-1, and we brought that into the
presence of the five integrations of
[SPEAKER_00]: CU071026.
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS indicated that this QTL affects
shifting a large amount of the ISOC5
[SPEAKER_00]: that's typically there to increase the
amount of ISOC4 branch chain fatty acids
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a subtle shift, but this will
have downstream effects that I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the line we created was called FA8AS,
kind of keeping with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature, and when you compare the
LCMS chromatogram you see these arrows
[SPEAKER_00]: point to a number of acyl sugars that are
either novel or significantly upregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: in the FA8 line, and these typically
contain these C4 compounds, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely the ISOC4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with this germplasm, using,
again, a tomato allele here, you see very
[SPEAKER_00]: little ISOC4.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're heterozygous for this region,
you see maybe a tiny increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is generally a recessive QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're homozygous for pinellia,
you see a significant upregulation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of ISOC4 fatty acids that are
part of those acyl sugars, and using a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple recombinants here, we're able to
say that the region was between those two
[SPEAKER_00]: markers in a region of about 1.5 megabase
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this region happens to overlap with a
recently characterized isopropyl malate
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase, which could be and is likely the
gene underlying this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we had gamete elimination
in recombinant plants that were just
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous for the top of this
intergression, so we tried to just fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: top part where we knew that the gene or
the QTL was lying, but we could not fix
[SPEAKER_00]: that because of gamete elimination,
and so as a result, the line we generated
[SPEAKER_00]: has a very full-length intergression of
most of the chromosome, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last fatty acid QTL I'll talk about is
fatty acid five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a mono-intergression line,
IL5-3, was identified as a source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transferred it into the presence of the
five integrations of CO71026.
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS indicated that this led to an
increase in extended chain fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: both straight chain and branch chain,
and previously it had been identified to
[SPEAKER_00]: really be working epistatically with the
fatty acid two QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we saw that when you bring
this QTL in, you have a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the total amount of acyl
sugars that are accumulated in this line
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that work led to the selection of a
line FA5AS, but unfortunately this line
[SPEAKER_00]: has severely compromised levels of acyl
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the LCMS here is kind of indicating
kind of the main change you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a reduction in particular in acyl
sugar that has all short-chain fatty acids
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase relatively the proportion of
acyl sugars that have an extended chain,
[SPEAKER_00]: a C12 fatty acid, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also get a little bit of this kind
of novel acyl sugar with an 11-carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fine mapping here was mostly using the
reduction in acyl sugar level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that if you do not have the
pinellia allele here, you have pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your heterozygous or homozygous it's
significantly lower and using the
[SPEAKER_00]: information from these recombinants as
well as some marker data, we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: define the area at about two megabase
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this region also happens to coincide
with some acyl sugar biosynthesis genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pair of acyl sugar, acyl hydrolase
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are likely the genes that are
underlying this QTL in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final line we created has about a
3.5 megabase pair in digression,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very likely that we would need
additional QTL to interact with this QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: to help raise the level of acyl sugars
again to make this QTL kind of functional
[SPEAKER_00]: in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we kind of created the single
fatty acid QTL lines, the next thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do was start to intermate some
of these lines, bring together a pyramid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fatty acid QTL, because we knew
previously from our identification some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them interacted epistatically,
so we wanted to combine them and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: effect the interactions would have on acyl
sugar level and chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not use the fatty acid 5 QTL,
because I mentioned the low acyl sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: level, so we used the fatty acid 2,
7, and 8 QTL, and we intermated them
[SPEAKER_00]: together and generated binary combinations
and then the triple combination of all
[SPEAKER_00]: three of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we characterized both the single
and the combination QTL, fatty acid QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: lines all together in a set for both acyl
sugar level, the fatty acid profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the acyl sugar profile to kind of get
more of a holistic understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sugars are there and what their
chemistry looks like, with the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: goal being to create a combination of kind
of a set of lines that could be tested
[SPEAKER_00]: against insects to really understand kind
of the effects of the chemistry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions of the QTL on insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the characterization, one way we
characterized them was through GCMS and
[SPEAKER_00]: through the acyl sugar assay, and we saw
that there was an effect of the fatty acid
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL individually and in combination acyl
sugar level and fatty acid profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we saw both additive and epistatic
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benchmark line, as I kind of
mentioned earlier, has kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic level of acyl sugar,
so we often refer to things in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the level of acyl sugar in that
line, as that's a way of standardizing
[SPEAKER_00]: over experiments in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fatty acid profile of this line,
these are some of the typical fatty acids
[SPEAKER_00]: that are identified in that line that make
up about 99% of what's there, the
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant ones being iso-C5,
straight chain C12 in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add the fatty acid 2 QTL,
as I mentioned, you get an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: iso-C11, iso-C13.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fatty acid 7 QTL, you get an increase
in the straight chain C10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be pulling it away a little
bit from the straight chain C12.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fatty acid 8 QTL, you have the
shift of an increase in iso-C4,
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in iso-C5, and unfortunately,
we saw some impact of this in preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, but when you really characterize
it, it was obvious that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in acyl sugar when you have this
QTL, and it could be the result of the QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the fatty acid profile or it
could be something else in that very large
[SPEAKER_00]: indegression I mentioned we have in that
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was unfortunate, but it's not down
to the level of the fatty acid 5 line,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really interesting things start to
happen when you start bringing the QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see kind of some additive impacts
when you bring 2 and 7 QTL together,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have the straight chain C10 from
fatty acid 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the iso-C11 from fatty acid 2,
but you do not see the iso-C13 really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's significantly downregulated when you
bring those two together, and you also
[SPEAKER_00]: have upregulation of iso-C9, kind of a
novel fatty acid that's not really seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: either parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have what seems to be a
real upregulation in the amount of acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be some both additive
and epistatic impacts when you combine the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 and 7 QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more strongly, you can see the effect
of epistatic and additive impacts in fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acid 8, 2 and 8 together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you see kind of additively,
you have the decrease in iso-C5,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in iso-C4 from 8, and you have
the iso-C11 and 13 from 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have kind of a little bit of
an increase in acyl sugar kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate between the two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But epistatically, you see you have a
novel increase in iso-C10, 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 14 that are barely detectable or
undetectable in the parent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have kind of a decrease in the
straight chain C12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely kind of an epistatic
interactions between those 2 QTL to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last combination here is 7 and 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the increase in iso-C4 decrease in
iso-C5 from 8, the increase in straight
[SPEAKER_00]: chain C10 from 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a lot of additive impacts
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not see a lot of novel fatty acids
here, so not a lot of epistatic impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do appear to see kind of an epistatic
impact from fatty acid 7 to compensate for
[SPEAKER_00]: the reduction in 8 and bring it back to
the level of a 7, 1, or 2, 6, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you bring all 3 together,
you see kind of a mixture of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects from the binary combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So additively, you see the iso-C4,
iso-C5 from 8, you see the iso-C11 from 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see the increase in straight chain
C10 from 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, because of the combination of 2
and 7, you kind of have the reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: iso-C13.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the increase in iso-C9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the 2-8 combination,
you have the increase in 10, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you have kind of a difference
here for 14, likely because of the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 7 when you combine it with 2 and 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of really interesting epistatic
and additive impacts when you combine
[SPEAKER_00]: these QTL together on the fatty acid
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the fatty acids that are
attached to the sugars that are part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way of kind of looking at the
fatty acid profile is using a multivariate
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, where you try to reduce kind of
the dimensions so we can kind of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each point here is a sample from one of
the lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers indicate which entry this is
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's nice to see here is that the
samples cluster together, so you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent profile in every sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, they're all not overlapping
each other as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could really say that the impact of
these QTL is to diversify the profile so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could really identify one sample
or one genotype from another genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you see is a little bit of
overlap here between the fatty acid 7 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the O71026 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really strikingly, you can see the
impact of fatty acid 8 QTL, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: these four genotypes to really separate
things in one dimension, and the fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acid 2 QTL, which really separates
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in all four of those in another
dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the impact of these
QTL on the fatty acids that are attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to the acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we kind of take a step back and look at
more holistically, the whole acyl sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there, you see here it's the
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really important to really see
what all these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, this is a sucrose,
S is sucrose, four fatty acids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to this acyl sugar, and their
lengths are right there in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that these kind of cluster
in a definable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have O71026, O71027, and the O71027
combination have a fairly similar profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really strikingly, you can see that
when you add the fatty acid 8 QTL,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a strong increase or novel
increase in a number of these acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them contain these four carbon
fatty acids, likely the IsoC4 from the
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid 8 QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see also epistatic impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, the 2,8 combination,
which I kind of mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot of epistatic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here where you have a
number of acyl sugars that are upregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: or novelty accumulated in those two lines
that have combinations of those two QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of the, I should have
mentioned this earlier, but the red being
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase here and the blue being a
decrease in accumulation of these acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really matches the GC fatty acid
data really showing an interaction between
[SPEAKER_00]: these QTL to affect the acyl sugar profile
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way of kind of slicing this data
is you can talk about whether you have tri
[SPEAKER_00]: or tetra acylated acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned they're typically three or
four fatty acids that are attached to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these lines accumulate exclusively
acyl sucroses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry about talking about
acyl glucoses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just kind of look at the effect
of the QTL on whether you have more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less tri or tetra acylated acyl sucroses,
you can see that fatty acid 5 really is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the amount of tri acyl
sucroses, decreasing tetra acyl sucroses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of having a really novel impact
on something that we call non-acetate
[SPEAKER_00]: tetra acyl sucroses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically when you have a four fatty
acid acyl sugar, that fourth fatty acid is
[SPEAKER_00]: a two carbon acetate group, almost
exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, when you have this QTL,
you get an up regulation in the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sugars that have four fatty acids,
none of which is a two carbon acetate
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So significance of that, we haven't really
elucidated yet, but that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two eight combinations kind of having
an epistatic effect here to increase tetra
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sucroses over tri acyl sucroses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, you can see when you
have eight in these genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you basically don't get any production of
these non-acetate acyl sucroses anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an impact of these QTL on kind of this
aspect of acyl sugar chemistry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way we kind of wanted to summarize
all this information that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is thinking kind of
ecologically about we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate insect resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we have a more diverse profile,
we might be able to get better efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: against insects and we might be able to
create a more durable resistance against
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use something called Shannon's
diversity index to kind of look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of the profile here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we were looking at acyl
sugars and the exact numbers here is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a greater number indicates
greater diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we were looking at kind
of two different ways of slicing the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was looking at kind of the number of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you move from left to right here,
you see you get an increase in the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of acyl sugars that are accumulated in
that genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, the two eight
combination, you know, having all these
[SPEAKER_00]: epistatic impacts and et cetera,
you see that those two genotypes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: the two eight combination together have
the greatest number of acyl sugars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are accumulated there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the data in terms of
the peak areas of all the acyl sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about the idea of, you know,
what's a profile that's kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: unique over the other profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just because you have less number,
the number of compounds doesn't mean your
[SPEAKER_00]: profile can't still be diverse and unique
from the other genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you move from left to right,
you're increasing the diversity in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of having a less even profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the two eight combination is
again at the top indicating the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of profile there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very consistent with some of the other
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was all the fatty acid stuff that
I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now going back to these three other
QTL that I worked with that impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: shift from acyl sucrose to acyl glucoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an acyl sucrose, this is kind
of acyl glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three QTL on chromosomes three,
four and 11 that interacted epistatically
[SPEAKER_00]: from previous work that I worked with to
try to change the acyl sucrose profile to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more acyl glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with a number of interspecific
back-cross populations and we saw a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll point out here that the numbers
indicate kind of a haplotype, one being a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato for that QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two being heterozygous and three being the
pinellia allele there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have the combination of three,
four and 11 but you're missing the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose for QTL, you have accumulation of
some of these acyl glucoses that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: large proportion of the acyl sugars that
are there, but you have a lower level of
[SPEAKER_00]: total acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like you really need to have
the acyl glucose for QTL to raise the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not have the acyl glucose 11
QTL, you really do not see any acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just kind of trace background
levels almost and you have much greater
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of acyl sugar again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have it on here because we
didn't segregate for that because we do
[SPEAKER_00]: for previous work, but if you do not have
the acyl glucose three QTL, you also don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get any acyl glucoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, when you have all three of
these QTL together homozygously,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of acyl glucoses that are a
large proportion of the acyl sugars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are part of that profile, but
unfortunately there seems to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in acyl sugar, total acyl sugar
level compared to 071026 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty consistent, about 60% the
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work helped confirm that you need
the interaction between these QTL and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of all three of them and that
unfortunately acyl glucose 11 QTL seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: lower acyl sugar level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like there could be a QTL or
multiple QTL that we're missing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would need to bring into this background
to raise acyl sugar level to the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: 071026, for example, if that's what we
want to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the process of doing some of this,
we were able to fine map the location of
[SPEAKER_00]: these QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acyl glucose three QTL is largely dominant
and a couple of recombinants here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the white bar being the tomato allele,
the gray being heterozygous, black being
[SPEAKER_00]: pinellia allele, and this region being an
area of recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just between these two recombinants,
we are able to show that the region of
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl glucose three QTL is between these
markers, which is an area of about 375
[SPEAKER_00]: kilobase pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within this region, there are only 64
kilobase pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are only 64 predicted genes,
none of which have been annotated and
[SPEAKER_00]: being involved in acyl sugar biosynthesis,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that could really give us an
opportunity to look at a subset of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential gene candidates through RNAi or
CRISPR, for example, to kind of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying the gene candidate under this
QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: The acyl glucose four QTL, again,
the tomato allele, if you do not have,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the difference here between 071026 and
these is that all these genotypes are at
[SPEAKER_00]: least heterozygous for acyl glucose three
and acyl glucose 11 QTL, which you need
[SPEAKER_00]: for acyl glucose accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have those and then you do not
have the acyl glucose four QTL,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're somewhere about 20 to 30% of your
acyl sugars being acyl glucose backbones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're heterozygous for the QTL,
you're about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have it, it's about 20 to
30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heterozygous is about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're homozygous for it, you're
somewhere above about 80% to almost 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using that information with some prior
mapping information on markers here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to define the location down to
about 700 kilobase pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within this region, interestingly
enough, there's an acyl transferase ASAT2
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, which could be the gene underlying
this QTL and this gerimplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The acyl glucose 11 QTL, like the acyl
glucose four QTL, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: incompletely recessive behaving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have, in this population,
we were fixed already for the acyl glucose
[SPEAKER_00]: three and four QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the same in all of these except
071026, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do not have the acyl glucose 11
QTL, you're down to basically nothing in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of production of acyl glucoses
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of trace background.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're heterozygous for that QTL,
the acyl glucose 11 QTL, you're maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're homozygous for it,
you're back into the 70s, maybe close to
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% acyl glucoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using the combination of that
information, these recombinants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some GBS data, we were able to
show that the location is right here
[SPEAKER_00]: between these markers, which is an area of
about 550 kilobase pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, again, this region
collocalizes with another previously
[SPEAKER_00]: identified acyl transferase ASAT3 gene,
which is likely contributing to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype, maybe not all of the
phenotype we're seeing, but some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype underlying this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the fine mapping, we kind of
generated some of these characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of wanted to get an idea
of what the effect of the acyl glucose QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: or other linked genes there could be on
the fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of had a characteristic profile
of a number of these lines and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid we created as well to kind of look
at just double checking the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: these QTL and acyl sugar level,
acyl glucose accumulation, and then novel
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the fatty acid profile,
which we didn't really expect to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different between these different
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here in sister lines,
one's plus and one's minus the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose 11 QTL, you have much higher
levels of acyl sugar when you do not have
[SPEAKER_00]: the acyl glucose 11 QTL, lower when you do
about 60%, like I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly in this hybrid right
here, it's heterozygous for all three QTL,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have kind of an intermediate level of
acyl sugar and an intermediate production
[SPEAKER_00]: of acyl glucose that amounts to about
maybe 40 to 50% of the total acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interestingly, though, we saw that
there was an impact of either these QTL or
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the linked QTL in these genotypes
on fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this line and in this line,
you see an increase in the straight chain
[SPEAKER_00]: C10, a decrease in the anti-IT so C5 fatty
acids that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be the result of either one
of these QTL, likely not the acyl glucose
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 QTL, but QTL acyl glucose three or
four, or there's a couple other smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: integrations that are in those genotypes
as well, because we generated these from
[SPEAKER_00]: backcrosses with the wild species,
so we brought along a little bit of other
[SPEAKER_00]: integrations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those could be involved in changing the
fatty acid profile, which was unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the backcross 1F5 population from which
we selected the acyl glucose 3411,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of our benchmark acyl glucose
accumulating line, we looked at the total
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of acyl sugars that were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, you see that there's a
range of Ss and Gs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you have sucroses and
glucoses, acyl sucroses and acyl glucoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strikingly, you do not have the acyl
glucose 11 QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this line, NO71026, are very
similar in their profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much only accumulate Ss here,
acyl sucroses.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're homozygous for acyl glucose,
11 QTL, you have a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting in that you have a
lot of Gs here, but you also have some Ss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some acyl sucroses here,
but they are completely different in
[SPEAKER_00]: structure from the ones in these
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of really interesting differences
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're heterozygous for just
the acyl glucose 11 QTL, homozygous for
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl glucose three and four, you have sort
of an intermediate profile that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: approximates a few of the acyl sugars from
each group, but more dominated toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl glucoses and the different structure
acyl sucroses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've created all this
germplasm, obviously we want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: testing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concurrently with during some of the
breeding, we already started working to
[SPEAKER_00]: test some of this germplasm in different
field trials and bioassays to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of changing the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a platform of lines
we'd like to think that we can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of the chemistry and
their impact on insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had field trials in North Carolina,
California, and Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I'll talk about California,
where they looked at the western flower
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips and tomato spotted wilt virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Florida, we looked at meme one
white flies and their ability to transmit
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato yellow leaf curl virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jumping right into the California data,
looking at tomato spotted wilt and western
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrip, you see that in the
genotypes that have very trace levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are cultivated tomato,
which accumulates trace levels of acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar that can really only be detected
through LCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have higher probability of
ovoposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fatty acid five line, I mentioned
it has significant reduction in acyl sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you see pretty high ovoposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In genotypes that have at least moderate
levels of acyl sugars, and there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in level among these,
you have definitely reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: probability of ovoposition here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were in leaf disks done in a
laboratory situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting when you compare though
fatty acid eight and the 7026 line,
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid eight, as I mentioned,
has a little lower level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a higher level of acyl sugar than
7026, yet its probability of ovoposition
[SPEAKER_00]: is at least as good if not better than the
7026 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an indication there that the chemistry
differences between these lines could be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in probability of ovoposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you see differences between
the fatty acid seven and the fatty acid
[SPEAKER_00]: two line potentially between 7026.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, similar in acyl sugar level,
the difference likely being more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact of the chemistry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously more work needed to really
prove that conclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not shown here is the acyl
glucose line, which was also lower in acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar level than on 7026, but also similar
levels of ovoposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, maybe chemistry differences
having that effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we were really excited to
see was that not only did we see some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in ovoposition between
genotypes, but we saw differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of the thrips to transmit viruses
or the ability for those leaf disks to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see again, the trace acyl sugar
controls, have very high probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have lower acyl sugar levels or
you have moderate high acyl sugar levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: you seem to see a decrease in the
probability of having the virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you see a lot of variation among
genotypes that all have pretty similar
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, at least moderate levels of acyl
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like here we're really seeing
an effect more likely of chemistry at
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting the virus acquisition and
transmission potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in particular, I want to point out that
the fatty acid eight QTL on the fatty acid
[SPEAKER_00]: eight line doesn't really seem to be
having much of an impact, but you really
[SPEAKER_00]: see that the two seven and two seven
combination lines seem to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be something unique about
those genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the acyl glucose line,
again, you really see a strong reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in probability of transmission of the
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this data kind of suggests to us that
there could be at least two mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing virus transmission or development
of the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that could be in these genotypes and
one that could be unique to this genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I mentioned this is acyl glucose
line, is acyl sucrose, is they have pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: different chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially we could combine these two
types of resistance if they're different
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe improve the efficacy even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously we're still trying to
understand how all this works,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these mechanisms could be independent,
but they're likely interacting with level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just have these QTL,
but you don't have a certain level of acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, they may not be effective at all,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last field trial and insect
information I'm going to talk about is
[SPEAKER_00]: summary of some information done in
Florida with Hugh Smith looking at white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies and their ability to transmit the
tomato yellow leaf curl virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Florida 47 susceptible tomato down
there in this year, fall of 2014 that we
[SPEAKER_00]: did this, you see you get 30, 35% of the
plants developed virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a field trial there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about the same as a TY3,
which is a virus resistance for TYLCV,
[SPEAKER_00]: which doesn't really function very well
heterozygously, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, when you combine the
heterozygous TY3 gene, which is not very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective on its own with a certain level
of acyl sugar in these two genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the plants developed a virus in
that field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more interestingly, if you don't
even have TY3 heterozygously, but you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a line that has this particular chemistry
of acyl sugars, that genotype also did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether that's due to the chemistry of
the line or some impact of level with
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry remains to be seen, but that's
kind of exciting to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to point out that the effect
of acyl sugars on the white flies being on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants is you can see here over the
course of the experiment, you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of white flies on all the genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a summary of a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one without acyl sugars
really, trace acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have some acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you really see a similar level of white
flies on those plants, but by the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the experiment, you start seeing some
separation in terms of the number of first
[SPEAKER_00]: to fourth instar white flies on those
genotypes compared to the non acyl sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all that to say, I think it's really
interesting that you can have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers of white flies on say these three
genotypes that have similar levels of acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar over the course of the experiment,
but you have definitely differences here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the proportion of them that developed a
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is kind of pointing to the
probable impact of acyl sugar chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is different in this line from these
two lines, or these two entries on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of the white flies to transmit
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really interesting results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the summary of all this is really an
analysis of how we transfer these QTL,
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them, characterize them,
and this idea of manipulation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathway in pursuit of insect
resistance, which is obviously something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's complicated in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we decided to go about
this, there's some pros and cons always to
[SPEAKER_00]: the route you go in pursuit of a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we decided to create lines
first and then test them rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some sort of insect survey and some
segregating F2 population, say with the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had done that second approach,
we might have identified some QTL that
[SPEAKER_00]: were involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we had tried to transfer those QTL
into a tomato background, they might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have had any impact because you may not
have had enough acyl sugar, or they may
[SPEAKER_00]: have needed other QTL to epistatically
interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we decided to do this
ended up being very useful in that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: now screen a number of different insects
in a number of different locations and not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do another QTL analysis for each
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously also, this whole project
speaks to the idea of thinking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: we really have to think more broadly about
this and how the biochemical pathways are
[SPEAKER_00]: very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a lot about the complexity
of that pretty quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really need to have a lot of
collaboration with people from broad
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, I've been interacting with
entomologists, pathologists, ecologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemists, et cetera, to do a lot of
this work and to understand how to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really need to have that
collaboration to help generate
[SPEAKER_00]: insect-resistant material in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to truly understand also the impact of
these changes to the fatty acids and
[SPEAKER_00]: changes to the acyl sugars and everything,
we really have to look at it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: context of the existing chemistry that's
already there in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because tomato has some existing
compounds, tomatines, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, that have impacts on insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really need to survey and
understand the impact of these QTL and the
[SPEAKER_00]: integrations we brought over on existing
defensive pathways before we can
[SPEAKER_00]: concretely draw conclusions about the
impact of the chemistry on the insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing some work to try to help
understand that and really understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: all this works together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe together, some of the acyl sugar
impacts together with existing tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that affect chemistry could be
having more of an impact together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really trying to understand that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really just would like to believe
that these results are pretty conclusive,
[SPEAKER_00]: that acyl sugars can function in field
trials and bioassays, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help reduce not just the insects being
there, but more importantly, reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: presence and incidence of the virus,
which is kind of the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in context of IPM, et cetera,
we'd like to think that these can be
[SPEAKER_00]: combined and used to help create
insect-resistant lines and hybrids that
[SPEAKER_00]: can help reduce pesticide incidence in a
number of different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's obviously a lot of people that
I worked with and that have been involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in my time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd like to thank all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many people to be able to
spend the time to think them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously would really want to extend
my thanks to Martha just for all her
[SPEAKER_00]: support and tutelage and, like she
mentioned, for helping to keep me focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried to go in a million directions,
and there's not enough time to do all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in more directions than I probably
should have, but she helped keep me
[SPEAKER_00]: focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thank you to Andre and Jennifer
so much for your support, your wisdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: your guidance, and for letting me use your
labs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I just wanted to thank my wife,
Karen, for being my support and just for
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing me to have a lot of late nights
working and everything, especially since
[SPEAKER_00]: we got married in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been kind of a roller coaster of
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for your attention,
and I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any particular effects of these
basal sugars on other pathogens or fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: quality or fruit yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been some studies that have
looked at impacts on bumble growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability of the sport to grow,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there's been a lot of
work in that area yet, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been a few studies that have
pointed to you have enough basal sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: there that could be an impact on the
growth of bummies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of their impact on fruit quality
and stuff like that, we definitely haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten to a lot of the downstream effects
of looking at fruit quality for et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we know that there are a number of
linked genes, in particular, the original
[SPEAKER_00]: five regressions in the benchmark line
that are associated with linked genes
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in smaller fruit, and are likely
involved in less yield, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the process of trying to
break the linkages, try to generate larger
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, more fruit, and then we can really
start doing some of the analysis on fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are obviously questions that
breeders, before they want to use this
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, understand that we're not bringing
along something that's going to be toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fruit or something that would deter
the ability of people to use the fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a very related question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really impressed by the results on the
viruses, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the way the experiments
have been done will allow us to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hypothesis that potentially the
chemistry changes could be affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior of the insects, maybe the
duration of feeding, the way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: feed, et cetera, which would mean that
they're still there, but that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: able to transmit the virus potentially
because of a difference in their behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's the question that I need
to work more with and demand from my
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what could be going on,
but definitely you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be just a direct effect
on virus as well, since the ability of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects to be on the plants could still be
a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nice thing is that that really
encourages us in that this is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: durable resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not killing all the insects off,
so they're less likely to support
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to the basal sugars,
and we don't have to, just because you see
[SPEAKER_01]: insects, maybe you have to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may still not be a virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's sort of hard to imagine how
a virus could be affected by this
[SPEAKER_01]: component.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't necessarily directly attach to
them, or it won't get in contact
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is direct, like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, I think, going back to the idea of
looking at the other chemistry differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tenegas that are there already,
I think that there could be some potential
[SPEAKER_00]: differences there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the fatty acid 17TL overlaps
with subpoena that are involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatine biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying to look this up the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of studies that show the
effect of tomatine differences on
[SPEAKER_00]: potential growth of viruses or foam
pathogens or whatever, but I could see
[SPEAKER_00]: some potential for there being a link to
other changes in chemistry potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to think more likely things
that the insects are just being different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's one of the main reasons for
the virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering roughly how long did it
take to generate the pairwise combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the three-way?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three generations a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in terms of generations not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of problems with fruit set in
some of the combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of mentioned we have problems
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the five integrations from our 2,6
that you actually have relatively decent
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit set in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you combine some of the other
integrations in particular, that's huge
[SPEAKER_00]: integration in terms of there starts to
be, I think, more incompatibility between
[SPEAKER_00]: the tomato and our background,
and we start getting less and less fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes we do increase in the 50
seeds from, say, the lime that has all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fatty acid 17TL pyramid together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there definitely are also impacts on
how to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that out already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glucose lime in that, if you grow them
in normal potting soil, like a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, you really don't get fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you cut the soil with sand and
treat them more like you treat the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species, all of a sudden then you get
fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of that understanding that earlier
might have helped us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took maybe a year now to kind of
start doing that once we have this single.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the expression of some of these QTL,
like where are they being expressed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier studies have really looked at
the expression of genes related to just
[SPEAKER_00]: acerbic analysis in general have shown
that they've really expressed only the
[SPEAKER_00]: last cell of the trichome in particular,
or just the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't looked at the expression of
some of these QTL that I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a possibility that they could
be working out of places and being
[SPEAKER_00]: translocated or moved into the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's more likely that a lot of that
machinery is all functioning in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome specifically, maybe just in the
last cell of the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could create it all right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially, you know, that might have
questions about is that because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic plant or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those questions haven't been
answered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since it has a particular effect on
virus, it would be interesting to see
[SPEAKER_00]: whether its expression pattern is typical
or whether that could help explain why
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happening like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But
[SPEAKER_03]: an interesting feature of the insect and
virus work is that the two insects tested
[SPEAKER_03]: are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is a semi-persistent, and the other is
a persistent transmission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it also affects agents,
researchers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a study point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's going to be interesting to
see is if in a different type of insect
[SPEAKER_03]: which has a different mode of virus
transmission, we get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the, oh, I drew that connection
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the white flying frisk experiments,
the fatty acid 7 line was the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do hope I haven't mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something unique about that
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a pretty small progression,
if you're getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only negative base pair is additional
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's maybe 3 into 3.2 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really the only difference
between that genotype and 726,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really didn't have a good control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of interesting questions we can
look at in terms of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tested that very early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were working on this early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing we did was look at whether
or not we had a toxicity issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do a whole set of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen something with a toxin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of the first things we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's no other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
