[SPEAKER_02]: He's a native New Yorker who spent more
than 30 years in the turf grass industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and was a golf course superintendent
before returning to grad school in 1986.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was recognized in 2001 by Golf Week
magazine as one of the 40 most influential
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the game of golf under the age
of 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not under 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: A honor he shared with Tiger Woods and
Jack Nicklaus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an international expert in golf and
sports turf management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Published hundreds of articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's traveled around the world lecturing
on environmentally responsible and
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable turf grass management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less reliance on fertilizer and
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's appeared on CNN, ESPN, PBS,
the Golf Channel and just in numerous
[SPEAKER_02]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_02]: USA Weekend, New York Times, Wall Street
Journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a visiting professor at the
Swedish Agricultural University and he
[SPEAKER_02]: served as lead turf consultant for New
York Yankees, Green Bay Packers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a long list here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to his career in turf,
Frank is married and the father of three
[SPEAKER_02]: children, a triathlete, member of his
local school board, hospice volunteer,
[SPEAKER_02]: little league coach, and alpaca farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Frank, thanks for joining us and I
think you're going to see why he might be
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering at this point, what's the link
between living sculpture and art and grass
[SPEAKER_02]: and he will be showing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the first time I've had to
listen to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That used to be really short and somebody,
my wife was nudging me that I should write
[SPEAKER_00]: on there but then there's the risk of
sounding like a nutball.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Marcia said, thanks to Marcia and
Craig, and all the people that worked to
[SPEAKER_00]: put this on Max downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really thrilled to be here and I have
to tell you, spending most of my life as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a functional turf person,
this has been a real, gosh, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: started this four or five, maybe it was
five years ago you started with me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: art of horticulture and what I want,
I want to start out with the end and the
[SPEAKER_00]: end is that the best part about my
involvement in all this stuff has been how
[SPEAKER_00]: it stretched me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very, you know, I was a golf course
superintendent, I'm not a big golfer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really just a grass guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent most of my life, I was born and
raised in the Fordham section of the Bronx
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't have a lot of, you know,
glorious grass stories beyond pushing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lawn mower and trying to get out to a golf
course for some open space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of my grass stuff, both in golf
and sports, filter strips and functional
[SPEAKER_00]: things and now alpaca pastures,
has been very functional and what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: liked about this work is that it's really
kind of stretched me a lot and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the great things that comes
out of doing this work and that's why I
[SPEAKER_00]: was happy and of course honored to be able
to give the opening talk because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're going to experience today is
this stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you get there, there's a pile of
dirt, and a load of grass, and next thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's something and so I look
forward to seeing, I wish, I hope I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: be there to see your faces at the very end
because I think as Marcia said from
[SPEAKER_00]: Longwood, that's really the cool thing
about this work and I hope that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: just get you started with some ideas to
stretch you beyond what you do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see a lot of different things and
a lot of these kinds of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually obviously near the London
Bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a promotion for a TV program in
the UK with a sculpture swimmer and
[SPEAKER_00]: mounded grass to look like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at this a little more closely
as we get into the form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we titled this The Thrill of the Grass
and Craig Kramer gave me one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: short stories from W.P.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinsella, which is the title of his story
and this story is about a guy who goes and
[SPEAKER_00]: steals sod from a field and takes it home
so it's really kind of fascinating story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Maya Lin who did the get nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the Hudson Valley here in
Newark and these are just these earth
[SPEAKER_00]: mounds that she's done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really easy to do and very, as most of her
work, very symbolic and of course what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do is to, what I'm trying
to talk to you about and get you inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: about is using earth as a canvas which is
not unique to us here but I think with
[SPEAKER_00]: Marsha's leadership really I think have
done some really cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we can be fairly whimsical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an artist down in Texas who her
lawn was dormant, Bermuda grass or dormant
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Augustine grass, whatever the heck
that crab grass is you're growing down
[SPEAKER_00]: there Felder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks much better with polka dots great
on her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course there's the functional
aspect and that's where I want to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's been the most comfortable
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass is function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in between the strips on this tram
where obviously there's pavement and
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing a lot of work with
Nina Bassick looking at the structural
[SPEAKER_00]: soil she developed that they can grow
street trees on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now using it to grow grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass on and thinking about starting to
replace these four acre Walmart parking
[SPEAKER_00]: lots with grass parking lots that can then
filter a lot of the pollutants that would
[SPEAKER_00]: come off the vehicles in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nuts about grass in this country and
I'm sure you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in New York State alone we have about
three and a half million acres of turf
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would call turf managed grass and
we spend about five billion dollars a year
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 75 to 80 billion nationally is spent
managing grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're absolutely nutty about grass and
you know I think I spend most of my career
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how to help us not be
so nutty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is most of that money is
spent by homeowners in and around their
[SPEAKER_00]: lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people go to extremes take the
lawn out pile up some gravel and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know on a hot summer day you're
gonna feel fairly warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter of fact you may see one of the more
ridiculous things in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking outside today if you venture out
at all if on this side of campus where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have some of our sports fields there's a
synthetic turf field hockey field plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: grass that we water four times a day with
what can only be described as a fire hose
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkler to cool it off because it's so
warm to play on that the athletes can't
[SPEAKER_00]: stay on it very long unless it's cooled
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now functionally obviously this is a moss
mat come out of the shower and step on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually not such a bad deal and of
course a lot of these things you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: or do yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now back to the functional part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of my time working at a
fairly you know with school districts
[SPEAKER_00]: regular folks trying to have decent grass
for the safety of their athletes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we get to talk about how even at the
professional level managing turf for these
[SPEAKER_00]: athletes to ensure their safety maximize
their performance and ensure their safety
[SPEAKER_00]: is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was of course a game that the
Pittsburgh Steelers played a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago where they brought in grass and
sod it over an existing field three inches
[SPEAKER_00]: of rainfall and it turned into a muddy
mess where the athletes weren't safe at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time trying to help
clubs and athletes have a safe surface to
[SPEAKER_00]: play in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is an aesthetic part to what we
do it looks you know what you do for looks
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is actually one of our research
experiments where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is one of the really critical
nutrients for color in a green plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's involved in the chlorophyll
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want to do something
crazy on your lawn and don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize it we've done some work looking
at using iron as opposed to fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: that might contaminate water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that iron is a really easy way to
get green grass without having to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we were experimenting
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of course golf courses we one could
find some art in this little practice
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that was built and you start to
see some of the striping effects the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with the bunkers at different
heights of cut you've got a green a
[SPEAKER_00]: putting surface cut it about a tenth of an
inch a fairway cut it about a third of an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch and then you've got grass around the
bunkers that are probably cut in about two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes just different heights can
give you a very different look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the flower hole at the Stevens
Point Country Club in central Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_00]: where I used to work before I came back to
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed this floral display three
times a year of course I'm sure all you
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking at the flowers I'm always a
looking at the grass but the contrast here
[SPEAKER_00]: between the colors in the you know the
deep green of the grass and the various
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of the flowers they change this
display three times a year it takes about
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 employees the better part of 40 hours
to change the floral displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of my favorite pictures this is
Bandon Dunes or Pacific Dunes golf course
[SPEAKER_00]: right along the southwestern or Oregon
coast it's a fairly new golf course and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I love is how grass kind of brings
out the subtle wrinkles in the earth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was very little done when this golf
course was built and designed by Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: alum Tom Doke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very minimalist golf course very
little was done here you can see they just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of threw some sand in places this is
just a beautiful piece of land that they
[SPEAKER_00]: planted some grass over the top and
there's very little management done out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep this a playable service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can get ridiculous with this
and some people like golf so much they do
[SPEAKER_00]: it in their office nothing living there
and then there's of course the occasional
[SPEAKER_00]: fool who decides to grass his entire
inside of the house sucking the fumes you
[SPEAKER_00]: can imagine why he's so happy and then
there's a functional aspect of room so we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a room inside and here is a room at
the State Fair the New York State Fair
[SPEAKER_00]: last year there was a living sculpture
demonstration done there where they built
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of sitting chairs a little love
seat a couch which you will be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: working on today and one of the things
that we're you know constantly you know
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously it looks good right now you're
going to get to do something today that
[SPEAKER_00]: might help it sustain itself sometimes
getting these things watered and keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: them healthy is a little tricky so we've
been figuring out ways of doing that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable fashion I get to work in some
fairly ridiculous environments this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: project I've been working on for the last
five years associated with the 65th Street
[SPEAKER_00]: renovation for Lincoln Center the Lincoln
Center development project this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: conceptual drawing that they started with
about five years ago and this is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like last week this is the
Juilliard school right here this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: new addition to the Juilliard schools and
Alice Tully Hall and this is a 25 million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar lawn roof which is going to be a
park on top of a restaurant on 65th Street
[SPEAKER_00]: so pretty soon you'll get to see this in
living color if you live down in Manhattan
[SPEAKER_00]: or wander down that way this is at Kew
Gardens again functionally grass can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great thing for bleachers maybe for
stepping stones maybe for just
[SPEAKER_00]: functionally having it in your backyard
for stairs up and down or just giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: that cascading effect and transition to
using grass for forms this is at Dartmouth
[SPEAKER_00]: College at Dartmouth in New Hampshire I
can tell you that one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: guys like me struggle with is architects
who sit there draw on a piece of paper and
[SPEAKER_00]: say oh doesn't that look really cool and
then somebody's got to take care of it the
[SPEAKER_00]: poor guy's got to have a sprinkler that he
has here that everybody wants it green and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's got to climb up here to trim this tip
by hand because you can't really get up
[SPEAKER_00]: there with anything so these do create
unique problems the students love them but
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in a unique maintenance situation
now from a form perspective it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly simple these are little indoor
grass planters that you can get on the web
[SPEAKER_00]: just to have out in your house the cheetah
professor maybe this is where your kids
[SPEAKER_00]: will start you can use the little plant
seeds that they send you or you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: grass seed just as well and here's the
swimmer again just you know a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: mounding up some grass and making it look
like the swimmer is making his way through
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see how intricate this is this
obviously the structure is the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: highlights here but you can see the
interaction with his face and the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the mounds looking where his
hands are going in it's just really a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating display and again one of the
things about some of this artwork is it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't stay around long you do it looks
really cool and then they take it away and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that lives are the pictures and
there's my project this is the moss snake
[SPEAKER_00]: this is from that turf works book by Paul
Cooper who he was here a number of years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago it was very pleasant meeting him and
he we took some of these scans right out
[SPEAKER_00]: of his book again nothing more than some
stone and one of the tricks we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: moss is mixing it with in a blender with
buttermilk take moss put in a blender mix
[SPEAKER_00]: it up with buttermilk and just smear it on
and you know it grows on rocks as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets a little bit of moisture it
usually will grow fairly well some really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting structures that you can do
with longer grass as well as planting
[SPEAKER_00]: grass over a almost like a topiary now one
of the things that I've liked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: is you know when you go start looking
around for these things you see how people
[SPEAKER_00]: use grass you know to make a state and
this is at the University of Illinois they
[SPEAKER_00]: planted these boxes to represent the age
child fatality statistics there's 3,000
[SPEAKER_00]: blades of grass in a square foot and to
depth to recognize the 60,000 people per
[SPEAKER_00]: year under the age of 12 who die of AIDS
so they use just having the grass out
[SPEAKER_00]: there as a way of honoring that and then
just odd forms of artwork inside a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that is basically suspended from
a ceiling with grow lights and sod laid
[SPEAKER_00]: over the top of it of course again you can
use plastic grass and this is an example
[SPEAKER_00]: of that where they use some living plant
material for the bucket but the carpet
[SPEAKER_00]: itself here is synthetic turf this is the
London Museum of Art and you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy watering it it's basically just a big
pile of grass and it's really fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: at night when I was there it was really
amazing this is a chapel in Czechoslovakia
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Czech Republic someone sent me this
one Craig sends me a lot of these but you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see they put grass on the outside as
well as on the inside and you can see it
[SPEAKER_00]: growing here and basically it's the kind
of thing that they do and then strip off
[SPEAKER_00]: and every year we'll redo it and of course
completely recycle all the things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: used to do it but the structure itself is
spent and of course here's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: topiary thing with some grass on it and of
course now you can start again getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into the whimsical a little bit the
giraffe on the lawn people like putting
[SPEAKER_00]: things on their lawns and then we get into
the whole animal range and you'll meet one
[SPEAKER_00]: of our favorite animal construction people
Danielle today this is again out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: turf works book again if you can't have
grass alive there's a synthetic version of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bowl and here she is one I think
really one of our stars I remember when
[SPEAKER_00]: she was taking Marsha's class she showed
up but this was part of one of her art of
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture projects she shows up in my
office and you know talk about doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: and she has this tray with her and on the
tray are about seven different farm
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and she's got a cow horse chicken
goat pig sheep and she's like this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do okay I think we got to do one
let's try to do one and I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really really epitomized kind of the
energy that she's brought to doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: and so this is again a shaped pile of soil
and she built this head with chicken wire
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuffed it with hay and there's these
two by fours that are attaching it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil pile and I can tell you of all
the graduation of the 15 or 16 graduation
[SPEAKER_00]: weekends I've been a part of I've never
seen so many people gathered around a
[SPEAKER_00]: single thing in my entire career here
everybody wanted their picture taken on
[SPEAKER_00]: graduation weekend in front of Morrison
Hall and the cow does it have a name is it
[SPEAKER_00]: Daisy Misty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty Sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some more of Danielle's work
now what was fascinating about this piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of project is is it evolved it started out
as green grass shaped letters for the
[SPEAKER_00]: College of Agricultural and Life Sciences
right cows right out on the quad but then
[SPEAKER_00]: as it started to die and go dormant she
spray painted it black and white so it had
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole another life after it was still
living now here's this is how simple this
[SPEAKER_00]: is this was Marcia's from a few years ago
one of her art of horticulture projects
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bunch of students and we had a
couple of hours to do it my staff gave us
[SPEAKER_00]: a pile of dirt and that's what you'll
start out with today if you're doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular project and then we get out
there and we get all kinds of people
[SPEAKER_00]: running side cutters I am supervising and
the idea was to create this walk path
[SPEAKER_00]: around this mound and that's what it
looked like when we were done we cut this
[SPEAKER_00]: off from an adjacent area we used water to
kind of tamp down the path area and then
[SPEAKER_00]: laid some sod over the top and there's the
class at the very end this is the year the
[SPEAKER_00]: following year the class wanted to try
something different so again we started
[SPEAKER_00]: with a mound of dirt we made stairs and at
the top they planted a door which I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you that the Cornell golf course
is right over here the 8th hole and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was an enormous amount of interest matter
of fact when you come over the hill on the
[SPEAKER_00]: 8th hole and you see this all you can
actually see is the door and you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell is the door doing out there
and so this was really quite a thing until
[SPEAKER_00]: a 50 mile an hour wind came and took the
door away so it has not the door is no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer there but the mound is still there
now this is Marcia's project at Longwood
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens that basically again just another
form of soil and grass there was a mold
[SPEAKER_00]: made to shape the pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and you'll see Alex again in another
picture here how long did this live but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all reusable okay now about furniture
this is some of what you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little bed here and a chair in the
middle of Paris a little little lawn chair
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there and you can see the size of
it relative to things around it's a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: large chair and you can do this in your
yard all kinds of lawn furniture you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be fairly sophisticated about it
or you can just take a chaise lounge and
[SPEAKER_00]: lay some lay some grass over the top of it
nice and easy some variations of sod sofas
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a nice one in integrated into a
garden you can buy a cardboard structure
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it up with soil and plant some grass
over the top and that's available on
[SPEAKER_00]: inhabit.com fairly easy to do something
that you can do in your own backyard some
[SPEAKER_00]: whimsical things these foam grass blades
that we found a little sod end table here
[SPEAKER_00]: another bed maybe with some sheeps
installed really fairly inviting I think
[SPEAKER_00]: though and then or something simple this
is one of our very first efforts that Alex
[SPEAKER_00]: built this is one of the art of
horticulture students fairly simple here's
[SPEAKER_00]: how it started out with a bare area a pile
of compost at the Cornell grounds people
[SPEAKER_00]: brought over Alex started to shape it and
then you've got a side couch so fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to do you can one of the things that
we've seen useful is maybe just a hand
[SPEAKER_00]: trim where you sit but you don't have to
mow it you can mow it mowing encourages it
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread and get thicker but this one's
so small it could be done by hand fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: easily yeah I would recommend that or we
have some battery operated shears that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use too I don't like the idea of a string
trimmer because they're very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep level and what happens if you've ever
worked one it really pulls it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and then you got these brown half
moves all over the structure now this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: project that Marcia's husband did at one
of his old camps and here's Alex who
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see today again you know like Tom
Watson said over the weekend a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: old folkies right getting around piling up
some dirt shaping it with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture laying some grass over the top
and lo and behold you've got a couch to
[SPEAKER_00]: sit on how long did that take?
[SPEAKER_02]: it took about 3-4 hours can you use grass
seed or does it have to be all rolled out?
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah very good question you can use grass
seed but then of course you're waiting but
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend on some of these slopes
that if you did that that you use some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of erosion mat because of the
steepness of the slope even gently
[SPEAKER_00]: watering it is going to cause some erosion
but you can there's lots of erosion type
[SPEAKER_00]: mats you can use or you know even at the
garden center they sell that seed mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you can just pack that on like a mud
pack if you don't want to use a saw now
[SPEAKER_00]: you can cut sawed from one part of your
yard and that's what we did out of our
[SPEAKER_00]: research center we did it with the
students we just cut it from one place and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in another place another question?
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them like there was one where
there are some you know little pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: wood or metal just to kind of hold things
together but generally it's just piles of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and once the grass gets stabilized it
really holds it together fairly well this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a project that Alex did down at the
Ithaca Youth Bureau in honor of Marsha and
[SPEAKER_00]: her husband Scott and again this is a nice
integration of stonework with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a couch here this is right in our
little downtown T-burg our little this is
[SPEAKER_00]: our little village where we live in just
up the lake a little bit and again just a
[SPEAKER_00]: pile of soil a couple of rocks at the end
I think you tried time up here didn't you
[SPEAKER_00]: had that work it didn't work okay it gets
too much love this couch we think the kids
[SPEAKER_00]: love this little thing and then some of
Marsha's students have done some lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: furniture this is nothing more than a flat
of Gromix put in a greenhouse with tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: ryegrass seed and you make a little
cushion and you pull it out of the flat
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it on top of the chair you've got
a lawn chair how about an entire bar not a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad deal this is one of Marsha's students
what was his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach yeah he was a maniac this kid this is
just a bunch of grass grown on burlap that
[SPEAKER_00]: we slapped on top of a structure he made
on wheels and there's his little tiki bar
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so what about mowing patterns and
you're gonna see you're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little workshop about this this is
probably the easiest of all things to do
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's simply a matter of mowing the
grass in different directions or rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass or in some cases spritzing it
with a little water there was a I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't incorporate the picture but if you
watch the Major League Baseball All-Star
[SPEAKER_00]: Game which it doesn't look like many of
you would actually turn the Major League
[SPEAKER_00]: Baseball All-Star Game on but if you did
you would have seen the St. Louis they
[SPEAKER_00]: played it in St. Louis and in the outfield
they had in the grass an image of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gateway Arch and underneath it an image
burned into the grass of the state of the
[SPEAKER_00]: the state capital of Missouri and they had
these little windows in there I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to the groundskeeper maybe a month
or so ago and he just gets a little water
[SPEAKER_00]: spritzer and spritz the water into these
squares and knocks the grass down so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: folded in one direction different from the
way the grass is mowed and you get nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and simple at Yankee Stadium that's the
way we like it there much more interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in winning baseball games and having fancy
patterns on the grass but Dave Miller
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote a wonderful book called Picture
Perfect if you're interested in this it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really an interesting little read very
simple how to take care of grass very
[SPEAKER_00]: simply I knew Dave when he was the
groundskeeper at Milwaukee County Stadium
[SPEAKER_00]: where the Brewers used to play and he was
the one that originally started a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this craze that's going on in the turf
industry with regards to mowing patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave is now the groundskeeper for the
Boston Red Sox at Fenwick Park so we have
[SPEAKER_00]: we have sometimes grounds managers who
maybe have an acid flashback or something
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can imagine what the athletes of
course if you're sitting on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the field it looks completely different
here's the Starburst again at County
[SPEAKER_00]: Stadium this was popular there at Shea
Stadium for a while before they closed up
[SPEAKER_00]: this is Frontier Field in Rochester in
preparation for the AAA All-Star game a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years ago again nothing more than just
mowing the patterns in different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions this is Rosenblatt Stadium home
of the College World Series with some
[SPEAKER_00]: baseballs on it and it gets fairly
sophisticated you can get fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated or fairly simple this is
Corey Miller's drawing for her dad dad can
[SPEAKER_00]: you do this and he went out to County
Stadium and did now sometimes people do
[SPEAKER_00]: some really goofy things by accident this
was a person in central Wisconsin who was
[SPEAKER_00]: very worried about fertilizer running off
their lawn so her idea was put the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer in a drop spreader open it all
the way up run around the lawn and put the
[SPEAKER_00]: water on really quick because then it'll
all get even right if you just put it down
[SPEAKER_00]: there and water it it runs off so much
that it'll all get even we got a call from
[SPEAKER_00]: this person who thought this was a mold
running around the yard so you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of things just with a little
bit of fertilizer because you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer doesn't move very far from
where you put it down but again it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be very complicated here's a very
simple pattern just mowing in crop circles
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've ever read Michael Poland's work
particularly in second nature where he has
[SPEAKER_00]: this chapter called why mow he talks about
mowing crop circles in his lawn and most
[SPEAKER_00]: people can do this very easily really the
only requirement is is is to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a roller or a tire on your mower
very simple little pattern here in a
[SPEAKER_00]: community leaving an area unload this is
getting more popular now as we're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to realize the carbon emission problem
from our lawn mowers we've been on a real
[SPEAKER_00]: push over the last several years now to
try to get people to reduce the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: times that they're mowing their lawns
recognizing number one lawns are trapped
[SPEAKER_00]: in carbon right green plants are trapped
in carbon and that's really good taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
but it seems a little odd that we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: burning a fair amount of carbon to keep
them on so we're constantly working on
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of being more sustainable keeping the
turf healthy enough so then it can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to trap carbon obviously when
it's brown and not growing it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: trapping much carbon but at the same time
not going crazy with the mowing strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we're burning so much carbon
here's one that I found
[SPEAKER_00]: here's that artist in Texas again as the
lawn started to green up she liked the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea maybe just purple polka dots here she
is really just a fascinating I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally think this would be really cool
to live next to something like this it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just it's just they make they make
athletic field marking paint that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put on the grass doesn't kill the grass
well you know relatively amount I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say it's good for the environment but it's
certainly you know titanium dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes it wouldn't be something I'd
want to necessarily disperse but certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: it's degradable most of it degrades well
on the brown grass it would last a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: long time because it's not growing on the
green grass here I would say at least
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks to a month it grows off you
mow it no it sticks to the grass plants
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly well it sticks to the grass plants
fairly well now how about some flyovers
[SPEAKER_00]: these are just a little bit of a stretch
for calling it turf right but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: some fascinating things this is some muck
soil in Japan where you can tell where
[SPEAKER_00]: they plow a little and left some of the
crop but some of this stuff is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing this is actually from Ellenville
New York this is right down here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Catskills and you can see some of the hang
gliders people hang glide over these
[SPEAKER_00]: things some really cool stuff here's one
of the hang gliders a promotion for the
[SPEAKER_00]: American Museum of Natural History Statue
of Liberty again you know nothing really
[SPEAKER_00]: of course this is really just a hay field
that was mowed but you could do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with a lawn if you wanted to do it
from your bedroom you could you know get a
[SPEAKER_00]: stencil and mark it out with flags and go
out there and cut some of it low and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could do the same thing there here's my
favorite Sarah America somebody that went
[SPEAKER_00]: to the trouble of doing Sarah Palin in the
middle of a hay field so and this is one
[SPEAKER_00]: that we did this is a Marsha one of
Marsha's classes this is our turf research
[SPEAKER_00]: facility Marsha did a one credit course
where they worked on designing this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for Mother's Day and then they were flying
mothers for free in planes over to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: and so she actually produced a video that
I think you can get on her website they
[SPEAKER_00]: made a video a DVD of the production of
this and you know some of its mulch and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have hay bales and some of this stuff
here is nothing more than black plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: that they put over the top to etiolate the
grass so it gets bleached you know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just exclude light from grass it gets
white or yellow depending on how long I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean eventually if you leave it on long
enough it will get brown but if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it on for a little while basically
what you're looking at is light star grass
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can do all kinds of things with
different shades of green and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches and there's some hay bales here
and this was an area that she we we killed
[SPEAKER_00]: out and they did a maypole or something
this is along the coast of Oregon they did
[SPEAKER_00]: a little continental map here with grass
around it how about grass you can wear
[SPEAKER_00]: right Neiman Marcus did a big thing a few
years ago on garden attire made some grass
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes again you know nothing more than you
know matted onto burlap stapled on to a
[SPEAKER_00]: shoe this is again a large sheet of burlap
and you can see here again the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: black plastic to give that leopard effect
by doing a light excluding light from the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass so you get that kind of leopard
effect on the grass coat itself here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden party ad that Neiman Marcus was
running again how about jewelry this is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorites that Craig sent me you
can here's this little guy making jewelry
[SPEAKER_00]: spritz in his little bit of grass making a
fashion statement here with a little tough
[SPEAKER_00]: to grass on the end or grass knuckles
instead of brass knuckles now here's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do these things burlap cheap
grass seed and peat moss and you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag this is one of Marcia's students
made a grass pocketbook here's a grass
[SPEAKER_00]: dress if you put miracle grow on it I bet
you if you spritzed it with miracle grow
[SPEAKER_00]: once a week and mowed it I'm sure it would
live several months if you gave it a no
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out on the this be something you
put on the clothesline when it's raining
[SPEAKER_00]: right instead of pulling the clothes in
from the clothesline put it out there when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's raining there's no soil yeah so those
overrated we grow sod we haven't I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not I mean yeah this is really
cool but we've been doing this for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 20 years on black plastic accelerated
sod production is very popular in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll use you know compost at about an
eighth of an inch throw a ton of grass on
[SPEAKER_00]: it make a grass mat and use it for goal
mouths or other areas that wear out really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly across fields and soccer fields
not if you're prepared to give it water
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients over the top you ever seen
it growing the cracks in the sidewalk see
[SPEAKER_00]: how easy my job is so how about some
devices these are somewhat whimsical this
[SPEAKER_00]: is this is whimsical but it's actually a
reality what a hundred and twelve million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars will buy you this is the
University of Phoenix Stadium out outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of Phoenix Arizona where they often play
the Super Bowl in the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Championship and they wanted to be able to
have a grass field inside now I was
[SPEAKER_00]: invited to be involved in 1994 at the
Pontiac Silverdome project when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: working at Michigan State University where
we developed an indoor grass system to
[SPEAKER_00]: play the World Cup when the World Cup
soccer was here in 1994 and basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: we found is you really grass can't live in
these dome stadiums for more than 30 days
[SPEAKER_00]: so we've had that's why you see a lot of
retractable dome stadiums they got them in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona and Seattle Milwaukee's got one
with a dome Houston where you open the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome for the grass and then you close it
so that the creatures can be comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're in there well they decided an
alternative to doing that in Phoenix is to
[SPEAKER_00]: slide the field in and there you go the
field takes about an hour and 40 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on this massive structure here on
railroad tracks takes about an hour and 40
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to move in and out so when they're
not using it it sits outside and basking
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Sun with a little bit of water and
when they want it they roll it in okay so
[SPEAKER_00]: next time you watch a game in Arizona
that's what you get of course these are
[SPEAKER_00]: good uses for lawn mowers the redneck
riding mower grass bike really nice with a
[SPEAKER_00]: grass jacket there the integration of
apparel and functional travel the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: bug the grass accord somebody that's
probably smoking some of the grass they
[SPEAKER_00]: use it little bit of grass dashboard how
about a grass board instead of a dashboard
[SPEAKER_00]: grass on the seats dude how about this
take your shoes off walk on grass all day
[SPEAKER_00]: and then this one of the more interesting
things we tried this past year is the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of grass as a film this is some work that
was done a number of years ago where they
[SPEAKER_00]: took a grass canvas literally grew it on
burlap which is what we did and then made
[SPEAKER_00]: it dark and then exposed the this picture
here and then shot the picture on the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass so that it would ultimately develop
the picture right because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: different shades of light over the top of
the grass and that the picture itself
[SPEAKER_00]: would develop over time this is a again a
grass canvas with a overhead projector and
[SPEAKER_00]: a plexiglass pan of water dripping down
and so you have stripes on the pan and
[SPEAKER_00]: water dripping in and you could see it on
the grass canvas here's some pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: again big grass canvas with a picture
shown on it same here this is how it
[SPEAKER_00]: looked one that looked it was developed
and here's the one Marcia did in the
[SPEAKER_00]: library last year this is two sheets of
burlap with rye grass planted on it tacked
[SPEAKER_00]: to some two by fours put together and you
can see the wood that's suspending it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we took a projector computer image
and shown Gandhi on it and it's big black
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of pictures of it I
should have it but I can tell you it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk of the campus for about a
two-week period because it had these
[SPEAKER_00]: little black hole they had these little
holes drilled in this big black draped
[SPEAKER_00]: display that was I don't know 12 by 10
kids could go up to it look and you had
[SPEAKER_00]: all these Gandhi peaceful sayings all the
way around it and eventually it we think
[SPEAKER_00]: we need a brighter light I think that's
one of the things it didn't develop as
[SPEAKER_00]: good as we like it did develop a little
bit but what we wound up doing and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the picture of it is one day I went
in there with Christine and we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: brush it and we used a little bit of lawn
along the lawn patterns with the same with
[SPEAKER_00]: the with the developing of the image on
the thing as well after we took it all
[SPEAKER_00]: away you could actually see Gandhi's face
so with that as opposed to keep off the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass my hope is that you know today and
beyond this that you go and use grass as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way of I don't know expressing yourself as
it's been for me stretching myself here's
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred I can't I want I can't do this
without saying thanks to Craig if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know Craig you'll some of you may
have him today this is Craig's dog Fred
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is nothing looks as good as a
black and white dog on a nice green grass
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit of dandelions so I hope
that you have a wonderful day today and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know you will have a lot of people out
there like Danielle and Alex and Craig and
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcia will be able to answer some of your
questions but one of the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the most about what this involvement
with this has not always been that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's a way of kind of expressing
yourself artistically which I never knew I
[SPEAKER_00]: had the ability to do any of that but also
that it's living in sustainable art this
[SPEAKER_00]: is not the kind of work that has to damage
the environment any way working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment it's an easy way to make
sustainable art that a lot of people can
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy that you don't necessarily have to
go to a museum to see so my hope is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have all those thoughts when you're
doing this work and really I think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a wonderful day it could be
hella sticky hot out there today too but
[SPEAKER_00]: as figures after it's been raining all
this time do you have any questions before
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it back over to Marcia
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of grass on the jewelry you know
I don't really know I think some of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: moss but most likely it's ryegrass because
it grows so quick it's pretty almost
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable I mean it grows on burlap we
grow it on your hat that's not bad I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: say no to grass so it's no dirt it's just
grass on yeah grass on burlap right just
[SPEAKER_00]: see it really heavy and water the hell out
say burlap and then peat moss we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: use peat moss for the condi thing no that
was just grass on burlap I mean burlap has
[SPEAKER_00]: a water hole I mean it has a structure to
hold water now there are different types
[SPEAKER_02]: of burlap too did you have a couple of
layers yeah go ahead how long does that
[SPEAKER_02]: take to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: a week it's really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: did you grow it on the two by fours or did
you tack it on after?
[SPEAKER_04]: we tacked it on before so the ryegrass
will hang on a vertical surface it'll
[SPEAKER_04]: stick?
[SPEAKER_04]: it roots right to the burlap but how do
you make it stick initially?
[SPEAKER_00]: well we grow it flat and then we lift it
and once it gets some structure to it we
[SPEAKER_00]: mow it once it gets some structure and
that's one of the things that's critical
[SPEAKER_00]: is when you're doing some of these things
it's really important to mow the grass a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit because that encourages it to
get dense it's somewhat counterintuitive
[SPEAKER_00]: but by clipping it it gets thicker it
causes it to grow more laterally as
[SPEAKER_04]: opposed to growing straight up how long
did you expose it to the overhead
[SPEAKER_04]: projector?
[SPEAKER_00]: was it a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: we needed to get brighter and we needed a
brighter light this might be kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: stretch but the whole idea with green
roofs is there any way that the grass
[SPEAKER_04]: could instead of siding possibly grow
grass on the side of our house?
[SPEAKER_00]: yes yes I mean it won't live unless you
give it water now you can use warm season
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses in some places where they won't
need much water but there's no reason to
[SPEAKER_04]: think you couldn't just get established on
the burlap and tack it to the side of your
[SPEAKER_00]: house or they can make a matrix structure
of some sort that you could use I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: they build straw houses straw bale houses
certainly sod roofs are not unique they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing them forever and the thing
that's nice about it is you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: go up there and sit as opposed to having
seen them that you can't touch or it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: die it can be a little bit functional as
well which is what the idea was at Lincoln
[SPEAKER_04]: Center yeah no I actually think that's
that's structural it's like gravel with
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mixed in that they grew grass over
the top of so it infiltrates in yes you do
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't work very good I don't
think so we've tried that a few times and
[SPEAKER_00]: we haven't found that it works so good
yeah but it's I mean grass I mean we
[SPEAKER_00]: really have the data now there's no reason
why we can't have grass parking lots the
[SPEAKER_00]: trick of grass parking lots is we think
that the trap 70% of a parking lot are the
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces about 30% of the traveling lanes so
the traveling lanes will be something
[SPEAKER_00]: other than grass so we'll make the parking
spaces grass and then what's critical is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you that you have the spaces on a
diagonal because what we've learned is
[SPEAKER_00]: when you turn on the grass especially when
it's wet you can tear it so you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to smoothly go in and park the car
like that but other than that it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just grass growing on the ground and
we watered it for a week when we first put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in and we have done less than nothing
to it we've done less than we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: virtually nothing to it and it's been
there we've had it out there for four
[SPEAKER_00]: years we've been driving on it and parking
on it for four years now so you could do
[SPEAKER_00]: that for your driveway absolutely without
question you have to mow it though don't
[SPEAKER_00]: you you could mow it but you don't have to
is there grass that grows at a determined
[SPEAKER_00]: height no well yes grass will grow to a
certain height it'll flower if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mow it right you'll get these wispy seed
heads but you can mow it a little bit so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it doesn't flower and some grasses
grow very slowly and then flop over so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a special kind of grass that grows on
the gravel that you've developed no we use
[SPEAKER_00]: tall fescue the same stuff you're going to
sod your things with today i'm telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: do i sound intelligent i'm telling you you
don't have to be smart to do this this is
[SPEAKER_00]: as easy as it gets i mean just a little
sea a little water and you got it thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: very much i hope you have a great day
