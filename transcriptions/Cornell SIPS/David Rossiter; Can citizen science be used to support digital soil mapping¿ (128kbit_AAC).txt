[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, welcome and let's see what we
can say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: This talk is based on a paper that's been
published in Geoderma last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to first give credit to my
co-authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say before, so you won't be
disappointed, I don't actually have any
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen science data that I've worked on
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of this paper was the second
author is Miss Leal, who's a PhD student.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a PhD student at Wisconsin under
Professor Juul, who's an old colleague of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine who I work with a lot in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at Wisconsin in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her whole thesis, her old PhD thesis,
is on using volunteer geographic data,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came to visit me here a couple of
years ago, a year and a half ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we got talking about could this be
used for the area that I'm most interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in, which is digital soil mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided, well, let's sit down and
write a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: paper about this, which is what we've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third author, many of you know,
Steve Carlisle is a retired soil surveyor,
[SPEAKER_00]: lives up in Aurora, and a very keen
observer, not only of the soil landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: but quite a thinker about interacting with
different stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gave us a lot of really good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have him together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's based on this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you like to read the paper,
then you'll learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my great amazement, after a little bit
of a few weeks, it was then actually cited
[SPEAKER_00]: in a Nature editorial as an example of
even soil scientists are thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, citizen science is a big
deal, which I'll explain in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wow, even soil science is getting
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of took my abstract and put
it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the paper has not been cited too many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if anyone has done much
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, a mention in Nature makes my
mother proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, some of you may well know about
citizen science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give the background in citizen
science, then talk about how it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: used in soil science more in general,
but then focus in on could it be used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the more technical aspect of soil mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my main interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about citizen science in a
more general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This quote, I can't remember where that's
from, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is the citizen, and we could
maybe call the non-specialist,
[SPEAKER_00]: might be the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act as either the observer or the
experimentalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is within a structure that's set
up by the professional science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we don't call it a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see in a minute the difference
between bird watching as a hobby and bird
[SPEAKER_00]: watching as citizen science, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a structure that's been set up by
the scientists within which the citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are really two main features for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, of course, is we're greedy as
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get people to make observations
or do things for us, then that amplifies
[SPEAKER_00]: our effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to hire another graduate
student, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a really important effort,
I think almost equal, is to build citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: support for science and scientific
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a literate, scientifically literate
public is another main objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are sometimes a little bit in
conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, we want this rigorous
scientific data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, we don't want to
make it too difficult for the citizen to
[SPEAKER_00]: get involved, to get some feeling for
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Scientific American has a whole page
with lots and lots of citizen science
[SPEAKER_00]: projects you can read about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some of the citizen science
projects that are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Connecticut Turtle Atlas,
people are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the turtles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they try to get people involved in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herpetology and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are lots and lots of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, we have a whole citizen science
association network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are logos of various,
both universities, such as here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: Bournemouth University and Aristotle
University, but also all kinds of NGOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In China, there's a whole page on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of projects that are
listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is getting more and more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about probably maybe the most
successful project and one that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: dear to our hearts here at Cornell,
because it's, of course, a Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: eBird is run by the Cornell Lab of
Ornithology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their aim is to look at the
spatiotemporal distribution of bird
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the advantage from the point of
view of the Lab of Ornithology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, a much denser network of
observations than could be possible of the
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their aim, their scientific aim in
general, of course, is understanding bird
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the broad sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they'd like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is, in this case,
they're having the citizens amplify their
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their web page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't update this, unfortunately,
for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as even a year ago, there were already
almost 10 million observations that were
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can view and explore their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contribute data and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all kinds of incentives you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your totals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is so successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's just look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the areas where they've received
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would really like someone to go up
to Siberia, which is a very important area
[SPEAKER_00]: for birds, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was really surprised by the density
in Mongolia, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be some active bird watchers
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see a bit of the problem here
spatially in that the distribution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: observations is not done by any kind of
sampling plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all volunteered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as if we, and the example of
Siberia is maybe a good one, you'd say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, look, this is really important for
migratory bird ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do a scientific
expedition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to Siberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to set up a sampling plan
according to our protocols, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have a very different sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really tell this in the United
States, but I had a student a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago in my graduate course here
working on e-bird data from Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you looked at the city of
Chicago, the idea was, what is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: urban bird habitat?
[SPEAKER_00]: She was trying to look at a habitat that
would be suitable from these observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you found a huge observation along
Lake Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were huge numbers of observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone sits there with their scopes
looking at the ducks and the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got to the south side of Chicago
with a little bit more rougher
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, there were no birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this either means there are no birds
there because it's bad habitat or because
[SPEAKER_00]: no bird watchers like to go there or
because the citizens who live there aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: so interested in bird watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's obviously, I mean, this is a nice
example of the danger, and I won't call it
[SPEAKER_00]: a danger, but a limitation of citizen
science is it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientist has to deal with data that
is not collected according to some
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling plan you might otherwise use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is this so important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this getting more important?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing, of course, is the
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GPS mobile phone has absolutely
revolutionized so many things,
[SPEAKER_00]: the social interactions of teenagers and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, for us, the fact you can go take
a picture it's geo-referenced,
[SPEAKER_00]: data capture apps, and you can upload it
very easily has really made it possible
[SPEAKER_00]: for anybody really with a very,
very modest investment to get involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and almost everywhere you have these
smartphones all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is this mentality,
and the idea here is that we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more, the idea of the specialist being
different from us as an ordinary citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: is going away quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And examples, for example, of reviews,
you remember you used to have to buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Review of books if you wanted to
read a book review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a new book came out, and what do
people think about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd read that, or you'd read the New
York Times book review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you go on Amazon, and everyone can
review the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an empowering thing,
and so many people are used to now doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that and giving their opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wikipedia is also a very good example,
let alone blogs, everyone can give their
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are mentally more ready to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the professional side is how do they
use this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the massive databases, the idea you
can make a much better model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more observations, you have more
points, you can make a better model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the example for the eBird would be
habitat suitability, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that can be done is now
monitoring, because people are out there
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly, and for example, they can
report an event like the first skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: cabbage they see, or a certain first bird,
or they can report a toxic dump site,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found someone that dumped
refrigerators along the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just go report that, and if
you're building an environmental database
[SPEAKER_00]: or a hazards database, you can just do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this early warning and a time
series, and these are both very useful to
[SPEAKER_00]: the professional scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that was a little bit about,
in general, and there are lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of citizen science, some more or
less successful, but I'd like to now get
[SPEAKER_00]: to soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is different about soil science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing, of course,
it's a resource that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: underappreciated or unappreciated in the
common, in the popular culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested, we had one of the
candidates for our geospatial position
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and have these very nice diagrams
of the inter-section spheres, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrosphere, and the atmosphere,
and the soils were absolutely nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils were implicitly there, how's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was interesting to me,
because the position was, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil science department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that just illustrates, and in the
popular knowledge then, people don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: much concept of soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, maybe if we have enough time,
I'll tell you a nice little story about my
[SPEAKER_00]: PhDA exam, and that was many years ago,
but I had a minor in computer science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start to examine me, and Tom
Scott, who many of you know, said,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, well, I'm gonna ask you some
questions about soils and see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, so please write down the orders of
soil taxonomy, and then we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm about to write on the board and the
computer science professor interrupts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, wait, wait, wait, you just used
the word taxonomy, is that like a
[SPEAKER_00]: classification?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you mean, you can classify soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you mean, soils are different?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are there differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I knew where the professor lived
in Coy Glen, and I could specifically tell
[SPEAKER_00]: him about the lacustrine soils where his
house was, and the terrace soils right
[SPEAKER_00]: across the road in the Coy Glen quarry,
so I could illustrate to him there were
[SPEAKER_00]: some differences, and we had a nice exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always thought it was a nice example
of a very intelligent, very well-informed
[SPEAKER_00]: person about many things, not appreciating
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second point is, even people that know
about soils, I don't think we have any
[SPEAKER_00]: soil hobbyists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of anyone who goes out
and looks at soils for a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go around and say, I want to
have seen every order in soil taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that could be a hobby,
but I've never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a pedology tour, and there were
two students from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland who were checking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One had a tattoo of the texture triangle
on his leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if that is true, how many birders
do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you are birders yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fanatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love their hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get out in all weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, right now, there are these two
birders that have set up by the Stewart
[SPEAKER_00]: Avenue Bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them the last several days
walking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're looking for eagle or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A falcon, maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: A red-tailed hawk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but they're set up there
with their scopes, and they have all their
[SPEAKER_00]: gear, so they spend all day there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we don't have, I guess the
point is in soils, we don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: ready-made group of people that already go
out in the field and like to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, a large group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will talk to Lee about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, of course, is the surface
soil is the only one that's visible to the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-specialists, and even if you would
dig, anyone who hasn't been trained to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand soil horizons, soil structure,
and so forth would not really know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at, or they'd have a very
crude idea of what they would be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, and I also mentioned this,
if you want to make a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: observation, even of texturing,
you need some kind of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a few things, like I can estimate
how many stones are on the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even then, you know, if you've ever
done that, you get very fooled if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use these grids to try to say,
really, what is the percentage of stones?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes some training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also difficult to have sort of
repeat of similar observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the burgers where you go
back to the same location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some citizen soil projects,
and these are the ones that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have slides on each one,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is from the British
Geological Survey, and this is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt that I know of to try to collect
point soil data that might possibly be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mobile phone application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It displays on the background the general
soil type, and it allows people to upload
[SPEAKER_00]: their observations, but I'll explain the
problems with it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opal is a very impressive effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is funded by the UK lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lottery in the UK,
and they take that money, and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to different organizations that
make proposals, and so they have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imperial College of London has set this up
in collaboration with museums,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have all these surveys,
and soil is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have six surveys, and you'll see they
decided to make an earthworm survey,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll see how they did that in
collaboration with a lot of schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the United States, we have Globe,
which several people in our section have
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was set up by NASA, but the
interesting thing here, the main purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: was to educate school children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really set up by a scientist to
say, I want to collect a lot of data that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can now use in my scientific project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to educate school
children in methods of observation of
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere and soil, but the main aim was
NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to collect the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my soil, and it kind of promises
a lot more than it delivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background of Europe is the general
soil map of Europe from the JRC,
[SPEAKER_00]: Joint Resource Center in Italy,
but the one in England is only a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very general parent material map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The British Geological Survey,
which controls the soil survey data,
[SPEAKER_00]: the old soil survey of England and Wales
was privatized under Margaret Thatcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we give you zero budget, you have to
make all your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they immediately, even though the data
was completely collected with rate payer
[SPEAKER_00]: money, they completely kept it to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only license it, and they don't want
to give anything away for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's now been taken over by the British
Geological Survey, but now you see this
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely general map saying we're on
chalk or on Triassic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocks, and that's all you can get as a
homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see the soil map even though
there is a soil map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't go there and say,
here's where I am, this is what the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: map says.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you upload your information,
all you can say is, well, is it coarse,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, or fine, and was it black or
white?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting some people uploading
things from their garden, but I find it
[SPEAKER_00]: really a lost opportunity, but you can
maybe decide for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is OPAL, and they have all these
surveys I mentioned, and they have a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they've done here, they've got a very
nicely worked out protocol for all their
[SPEAKER_00]: surveys, and the reason it's becoming
successful is because they're working
[SPEAKER_00]: through the schools, and they've worked
with the teachers in the schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's mainly school children,
as you can see from the kind of publicity
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, but look what they're holding.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they have a nice worm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they very happy that they found a
worm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they learn how to describe,
tell the different types of worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: count worm density, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main thing about their soil
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see all the things they've
done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter your results, results map,
earthworm guide, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've decided to concentrate on the
earthworms, and they've made really a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of data, and it's much more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collected data on soil temperature,
moisture, and so forth at these various
[SPEAKER_00]: stations, and then mainly through schools,
and so you see this teacher's guide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are things they tried to get the
students to understand, but it was more a
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching effort, and I don't think they've
really collected much data that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's get to narrow down even
further into digital soil mapping,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is my interest, and some I'm sure
you know about this, others maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soil mapping, of course,
is we would like to show spatially the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of the different types of
soils, either the properties directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we'd like to map the pH everywhere or
the soil texture, or soil types,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to some classification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, soil series or soil orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The digital soil mapping just means we use
computer algorithms to speed up or help
[SPEAKER_00]: this process, and we have this mapping
paradigm that goes back, that McBrattney
[SPEAKER_00]: and his colleagues back in, now it's
already 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So systematized, and everyone uses this
concept, and how we work it out is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different, but he didn't like the corped.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought corped didn't sound good,
if you know your Jenny equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he decided scorpan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to make scorpion, but he
couldn't think of any I to put in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have scorpan, and so he put the A in
there instead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used anum instead of time, so he could
have A, but there is something new in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know your Jenny equation,
the point here is the soil that we see is
[SPEAKER_00]: meant to be not randomly distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there for a reason, so it's based on
the climate it's found in, the organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that were worked both in and above the
soil, the relief, so where it is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: topography, the parent material it
developed from, the time it had to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all in the Jenny equation,
but here we have two other factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have S as a function of S.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that supposed to mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supposed to mean it's based on the
actual observations we've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he put it in there,
so you can't do this abstractly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You calibrate it based on actual
observations, and then the N here is there
[SPEAKER_00]: for geostatistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to say neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that if you know the soils you've
observed close by, it gives you some idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what soils you might find after you've
taken these others in account,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's just a conceptual way,
but what do we do when we now go to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to find a covariate that covers
the whole area we want to map that each
[SPEAKER_00]: covariate represents part of that
equation, and of course it can be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a colleague down in University of
Florida, Sabina Grunwald, and she throws
[SPEAKER_00]: 350 different covariates in a great big
data mining model to try to figure things
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really an advocate of that
approach, but that's an idea, but each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those covariates are meant to represent
something that would affect soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you have vegetation
indices and you look at the intensity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetation or the seasonality of the
vegetation, it might tell you something
[SPEAKER_00]: about the organic matter, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the S was then the point
observations for the soil, and we need
[SPEAKER_00]: point observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of covariates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have digital elevation models and
derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a huge number of remote sensing
products, stream networks, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this, geology maps,
but what we don't have or what are very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive are making point observations of
the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept of how we might be liking
to use citizen soil science here would be
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to find some observations we could
use either in our model building or even
[SPEAKER_00]: if we've built models with more reliable
information, maybe for the model
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which probably shouldn't be called
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been convinced never to use this
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I put it in quotes,
because I was convinced by a colleague who
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with in the Netherlands that a
model is never valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never say it's valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can evaluate it and see how well it's
performing and so forth, but to say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: valid is sort of like you have a validated
driver's license or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: She convinced me not to do that,
so I've ever since tried to be strict
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can maybe get a philosophical
discussion about is a model ever valid?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so this is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our motivation was to thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just show an example digital soil map to
just, if you have never seen one before,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is Arusha in Tanzania and one is at a
one kilometer resolution and one is at a
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 meter resolution of the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the prediction of, in this case,
the soil organic carbon concentration in
[SPEAKER_00]: the top five centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I didn't show the scale bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have shown that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, so how are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't been everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've built some model and you can
see what's happening here is as we go up
[SPEAKER_00]: the volcano, first off we get more
volcanic parent material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, we get higher elevation where it's
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter won't decompose as much
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other factors that might come in
here, but that's how these maps are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly to mill the model and
possibly to evaluate it, we need some
[SPEAKER_00]: observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like someone to go in a lot of these
places and take a soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why involve citizens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for us we'd like to increase the
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think, of course, just like the bird
watchers or the bird ecologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd get better predictive models if we
had more observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get to this in just a minute
and show an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like maybe to correct mistakes on
published maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you've seen a soil map,
what you realize is they're typically made
[SPEAKER_00]: now as polygons and the surveyor has
really not been everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken some samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a mental model, but they could
have made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have an observation where it's
predicted to be one thing and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: something else, it allows a professional
mapper to say, hmm, I didn't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take that observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's a true observation,
I better rethink my mental model and would
[SPEAKER_00]: allow them to then improve the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way would be to take a published
map and downscale it or disaggregate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have especially a more
general soil map where it's been done
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe at a scale of 100,000 or 200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there are several soil types in
there, but you don't know where.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if other people have gone there,
that helps you to make a more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, number one, we'd like the citizens
to have a good appreciation for the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like them to know there are different
soils, that they have different
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities, that they occur at different
places on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more people we could get out there
looking at soils and realizing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we would just be building support for
soil survey in a more general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like people to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this concept of the
connectivity, the people appreciating
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and thinking as a citizen about the
quality of their soils, the health of
[SPEAKER_00]: their soils in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably most citizens now are quite aware
of water quality, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clear if their lake is getting
polluted or if they have foul-smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: water and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people feel connected to their water
resource, but often not to soil resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now what we did after that,
my co-authors and I, we really think
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, who could be the citizen
scientists?
[SPEAKER_00]: How could we categorize these people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some person might be in
different roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go through all these different
types of people that we might attract to
[SPEAKER_00]: be our citizen scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these groups, the interesting thing
about this is these all have a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to approach one of these
groups, like if I go back here,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want to, I'll talk to the greens or
the gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a culture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to attract them,
you'd have to meet them with the culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way they're thinking and making a
project that's attractive to them and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are probably very different types
of people, and they would call for a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mention the national culture here
because we are interested, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in doing this around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of difference between
national cultures, both in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens, the mentality, but also the way
that people would take to sharing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, letting you on their land
to look at data or even if it's my own
[SPEAKER_00]: land, am I willing to share data?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my cultural norms and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have these other things that are
quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists and the public have a different
relation in different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were thinking of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's talk about the groups one
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, yeah, do I call them
citizens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm talking about, this is the closest
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people in the room here would fit
certainly in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a research soil scientist,
but you're not a soil mapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an agronomist, you're not a soil
mapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a professional in your field,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call you an educated citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're to some degree familiar with
existing soil survey protocols and
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're aware there's a soil survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know exactly, you have a
general idea that these exist and what can
[SPEAKER_00]: be done with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an interest in these maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have an idea that if you're
interested in agronomy or soil science,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really have an interest in a reliable
soil map.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a professional attitude towards
soil information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept that you might get involved
in during your routine, your other work
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're doing in making certain
observations that would help the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mappers doesn't seem like such a big
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be one type of group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would involve not so much more just
figuring out a protocol that would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: too hard for people to do in the course of
their other work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant breeder goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have plant breeding plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could you ask them to do as they're
out there that might help you with your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mapping?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now the next, of course, are farmers
or we might say land managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be the farmer themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the forester managing a
forestry block or DEC forester,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are familiar with their
portion of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly, they're definitely aware of
the value of soil information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motivation, we're trying to think of
the motivation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the motivation for the first group
might have been, well, you know science is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know your colleague is working to
make a better soil map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can contribute to that,
you feel, well, you're increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific project in some sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I think they're more interested in a
more detailed soil map of their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the other areas compare land
management methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they'd like to have a more
detailed map of, let's say, the county or
[SPEAKER_00]: a surrounding area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the main interest is saying,
well, if we can convince them to supply
[SPEAKER_00]: data, they would get back a more reliable
map somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be the motivation to
get farmers involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say a bit of a problem with this,
of course, is the privacy issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, of course,
anyone can look at the soil map and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, how your farm is mapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm thinking of buying your farm or I'm
comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's a more detailed map,
maybe I don't really want that information
[SPEAKER_00]: to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, civil engineers and others involving
construction are an interesting group
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're the ones who go and see
the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have road cuts, surface mining
excavations, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the ones that are already
making their own geotechnical
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're used to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we usually only go to two meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know the reason that soil survey
only goes to two meters?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a true story,
but I heard back in 1899 when the Bureau
[SPEAKER_00]: of Agriculture and Industry was set up,
Milton Whitney was our arguing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: head of the geological survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the geological survey said,
we don't need a soil survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is happening in the upper part
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're only looking at the geology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just call it quaternary geology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had kind of an argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided that since bodies were
buried to six feet, that would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can call that the soil down to six
feet, which we now call two meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that's a true story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, there's been a movement in
recent years headed by the Australians for
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious reasons, because they're in a very
old weathered landscape, to what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: whole regolith pedology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just been a special issue in,
I think, geoderma about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of papers on this where they're
saying, look, pedology is the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: regolith down to hard rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all a continuous process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's much more conductivity much
deeper in the soil than soil scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: have thought in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would actually, and USDA is behind
this, NRCS, they'd like to look deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it routinely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these people looked at quite some
depth, so they could be a good source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a picture of, actually,
this is a soil survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like this picture because it shows
an excavation that was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw, well, before they build the
buildings here, we'll jump in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll take this opportunity to see the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing is here, not only can
we see the soil where we're taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: observation here, but you can see in the
back, we get a very good idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, which is very hard to do if
you don't have a trench or a pit like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I can ask you in this picture,
which one is the professor head of the
[SPEAKER_00]: group?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in the chair, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's very active, but he's taking
the notes, so that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my work group at the Soil Science
Institute, the Chinese Academy of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a civil engineers,
but you see the point that these people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the excavation, they have an
opportunity possibly, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to take photos for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be maybe just enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we already have a good idea what the
soil type is here, but we don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: real good idea of the variability,
let's say, of the horizons, if someone
[SPEAKER_00]: just takes a photo back here and sends it
to us, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of thing we might ask
them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, gardeners, a lot of people think,
well, the gardeners would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: choice, but I don't think so for a couple
of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, the gardeners are just managing
one site very intensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, they're modifying the soil
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gardeners are an interesting group to
work with for many things, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really help us with digital soil mapping
over larger areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're enthusiastic people,
and they're a ready-made group,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think they're so useful for
digital soil mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people who go outdoors anyway,
hikers, geocachers, these people who go
[SPEAKER_00]: out and they like to go out anyway,
I'm thinking they may be interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more about their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might be able to convince them to
do something as they're going along in
[SPEAKER_00]: their regular outdoor activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about what we might ask them to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have the greens and the
organizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greens, these are people that love the
environment, even if they don't always get
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the environment, they love it
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the motivation, well, today's St.
Patrick's Day, I see we have one person
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing green, so this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time I went down into Boston on St.
Patrick's Day, wearing my orange coat was
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, well, Northern Irish are Irish,
too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but the idea with the greens,
it would be if people are already
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, we didn't get to think too
clearly about what they might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organizers, though, are an interesting
group, a really interesting group,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of you may be in this group if
you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people that have a psychological
need to live in an organized environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: An organized world.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you, if you go look at a
Wikipedia entry about something you know
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and there's an incorrect statement
there, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you edit it or do you just go on and
say someone else will edit it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, and I may include myself
partly in this description, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand that there's a wrong
statement there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why am I taking my time, no one's
paying me to do it, to correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not a statement about me or
someone I know, it's just a wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take my time to organize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OpenStreetMap is another really good
example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just let the professional
mappers, why are people updating
[SPEAKER_00]: OpenStreetMap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I'm thinking in terms of the
soil map, if these same people can be
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated to go look at the soil map and
compare the soil map that exists with
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really there, they might have a
compulsive interest in sending information
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would not downplay this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we see really good examples of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of people that every,
in the Netherlands, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable, every bike path with its
width and its surfaces in the
[SPEAKER_00]: OpenStreetMap, and someone is doing all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much time on their hands, too much,
you know, they only work 36 hours a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you've got some time, it's not like US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they work harder than 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's turn over to the other
side and say what information could be
[SPEAKER_00]: provided to us and how hard would this be
to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about all of these one at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the list here,
and let's talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the tacit knowledge is what I might
call the local knowledge of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not expressed in really scientific
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really make, this is without
making a new observation, but you make a
[SPEAKER_00]: comment on a published map or a comment
maybe on even an unpublished map where you
[SPEAKER_00]: say, well, I know over in this area it's
really, really bold and very, really
[SPEAKER_00]: rocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never use machinery over here in
the bulbous, you know, or here it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at my photo, I say over there,
oh, it's really, really eroded over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gullies are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subsoil is coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of knowledge where without
making a new observation, the person who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows their land very well can either
comment on a published map or they could
[SPEAKER_00]: make a sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is difficult to translate into point
observations, but I can imagine it's
[SPEAKER_00]: useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we haven't looked at points,
we've kind of made observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's opportunistic, newly acquired
information, and you know the see
[SPEAKER_00]: something, say something motto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that used?
[SPEAKER_00]: New York subway maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we need here is to say, look,
if you're out there and you see something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think is interesting and
important to us, just send us a,
[SPEAKER_00]: just tell us where you were and send us a
geo, a geotagged photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see lots of things from just a
surface photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have an idea already of what's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a detailed observation,
but this can help us a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage here is we're not asking you
to fill in any form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever get these things on the web
where they say, please take a survey to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve our website?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got one from the New York Times
this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I subscribed to the New York Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, okay, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up and said, this will take
10 minutes to complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to answer questions for 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're just asking me a couple
of questions, I might do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, there's no protocol and
no complication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's an example actually from me,
which I did out one day for a bike ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see they've done deep plowing on
this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these iron, huge
ironstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ironstone gravels here and then
big, big chunks of ironstone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call bog iron,
Ortstein in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a concentration of iron that's been
concentrated by groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmer had decided, had this
drainage problem in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it decided to deep rip it for some
reason and brought all these stuff up from
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a meter deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see all this stuff you wouldn't
normally see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went back and looked at the soil
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have sort of two units coming in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the 1 to 50,000 soil map.
[SPEAKER_00]: But neither of them say anything about bog
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this unit here, this one of the
stipples, does talk about bands of iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: thin bands of non-continuous iron that
might be precipitating through the Spodek
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have a nice, very fine sand
Spodek horizon with little lines of iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing about this groundwater iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is definitely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the original surveyor
didn't dig that deep or what, but you see
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil type is quite a bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something that I would,
if the mapping project were active,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say here was my point,
here's the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would presumably be
reinterpreting the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see here that the Dutch don't
think there are any soils in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're way behind other European
colleagues, the French and Germans
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, even the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, here's an idea that came from
Steve Carlisle, and we worked it out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you'd have a map,
a project called Improve Your Soil Survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you would, the citizens
access the online map, which you can
[SPEAKER_00]: always do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And displaying it on their spark foam or
tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can check the soil
description that they see there with what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seeing on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can then report things that don't
seem to match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly things on the surface,
coarse fragments or texture, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you can easily see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's any discrepancies,
they could either confirm or they could
[SPEAKER_00]: send in, they say when here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is the professional
surveyors in NRCS, in the case of the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: would review this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's actually an example from
Newfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a published soil survey map,
which is online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed it out very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all from our NRCS, and I can print
out the map and show it on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is up on Irish Hill Road in Newfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use, I really recommend this
location at the California Soil Resource
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken the whole Sergo database,
and they've made it into something we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just show on Google Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can show the soil map on Google
Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the perspective, and it's a
really nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see they did a good job also on
soil survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click on it, you will see it's
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click on this, you'll get all
the, all the descriptions of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see that this shows the modal
profile going down to almost two meters in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Volusia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get there, some of you may
know this spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the natural, the Green Springs
Natural Cemetery up on Irish Hill Road
[SPEAKER_00]: just before the Arnett Forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get up there, you will see
that there's no way the soil is this deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you look at their website and
they ask, one of the FAQs is, can I dig my
[SPEAKER_00]: own grave or my own relative's grave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would be a really nice thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, you know, it's very natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say no, because after you get to
about a meter, you are going to be stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a backhoe because you are not
going to be digging this stuff out down to
[SPEAKER_00]: two meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're clear on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go and look at any of these
graves that are open, you see here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: pile, and huge numbers of rocks have been
excavated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, the depth to the bedrock here
is much shallower than mapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the solution here,
if you would, if this NRCS would look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this, would be to remap that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the whole, everything they're
calling the Volusia there is probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's much, much shallower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another soil series,
I think, when that's not, what is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: John?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Arnett, it's the wetter,
it's the one, it's in the Arnett sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's as shallow as Arnett,
but it's the next wetter one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they could, yeah, no,
this would be, it's like Arnett,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like Arnett, but it's a little bit,
it's the wet, little bit, one range class
[SPEAKER_00]: wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the lords down there would be
remapped as Arnett.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason they did this is
when, in the old days, when they mapped
[SPEAKER_00]: the counties, they didn't want to have too
many soil series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they had only a small area of one
series, they'd correlate it to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these mappers may well have known it
was shallower, because Arnett is mapped,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Arnett series is mapped a lot in the
Arnett forest and in, and in, in Shemung
[SPEAKER_00]: County, for example, but not here,
because it's still Tompkins County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, okay, almost finished here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get to the more difficult part,
which is the protocol-guided information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much more difficult than the
opportunistic observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a protocol, you have to
get the observers, you have to train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality control, though,
makes this a much more consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: observation that you could really use
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a protocol that's, first off,
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't ask someone to do something
unsafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digging a deep pit, maybe it'll fall in on
them or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can make, pull their back out
digging, you know, various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're professionals, we're all covered by,
well some of us are covered by Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but you have all this,
this is all very fine, but then I guess my
[SPEAKER_00]: question here when you have this protocol
division, you're asking them to get
[SPEAKER_00]: training and to follow a protocol,
and really what's the motivation for them
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit unclear for me to see
what that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to be like being in the volunteer
fire department.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of training involved,
but the motivation is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're helping your community,
you're working in a nice team,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's a reason you go through all
this training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what they did in OPAL, and they
have a 16-page field book just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They teach the kids how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nice, but this is the kind of
material you would need to develop this
[SPEAKER_00]: level of material if you want it really
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this survey step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to measure a 20 by 20 centimeter
square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do things just right so the
survey is really consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they have high quality data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical samples could be submitted for
analysis, but I'm a little reluctant about
[SPEAKER_00]: that because all of these issues here,
finding a representative site,
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing the site, the surface soil,
sampling it, putting it in the bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that I just find is probably maybe a
bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I think is the precision
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is really citizen
science as such because the farmer is a
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen, of course, but I think the
problem here is there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot has been done on this,
but I think most of this data ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: being proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers do not want to release this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a way to say, we will use
your data to help us improve our map,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we won't show your data directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be ways to do that,
but again, this would take some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so these are my conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that we could increase our
spatiotemporal density somehow with this
[SPEAKER_00]: soil less glamorous, but there is a
community of people, us, we hope,
[SPEAKER_00]: we like it, and maybe we're very attracted
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our environmental science major,
more and more people are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and agriculture, which is
good, and maybe our numbers are
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the last thing is that the
citizen-scient relation, we have to think
[SPEAKER_00]: very closely about the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me and one of my co-authors.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
