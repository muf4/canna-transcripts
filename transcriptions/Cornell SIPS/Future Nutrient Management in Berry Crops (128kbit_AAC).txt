[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Laura McDermott from Cornell
Cooperative Extension talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to welcome you to the
Northeast SARE Professional Development
[SPEAKER_03]: Project, Soil Management and Berry Crops
as a Model for Management Education.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 11th in a series of 12
in-depth berry crop nutrition and soil
[SPEAKER_03]: management trainings, and we are really
happy to have you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you log on, if you would please just
know in the chat box where you are from
[SPEAKER_03]: and what you work with, that would really
help our speaker, who is from the
[SPEAKER_03]: University of Florida, get a better idea
of who is in the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I expect that we'll have a few more people
log on, but in the meantime, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: just show you around in case you have not
been here before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that you're accustomed
and familiar with the Adobe Classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The web links box at the lower left-hand
corner is where you can be linked directly
[SPEAKER_03]: to the websites that are listed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The webinar archives and Northeast SARE
are listed there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then in the lower right-hand corner are
the files that we would be very happy to
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you who have not filled out the
educator, the Northeast SARE Educator
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-Test and the Northeast SARE
Demographics Questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these are very important for the
grant information, so we encourage you to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that and send that back to Kathy
Heidenreich.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's just allow just a few more
moments for people to log on, and then I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go into the second part of the
training, but just let me give them
[SPEAKER_03]: another minute or so to make sure that
everybody's logged on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to draw your attention to the
fact that we're looking for a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of input, and at the very bottom of the
notes pod, if you scroll down,
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy has stated that if there's any
topics or issues related to berry crop
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and nutrient management that have not
yet been addressed, next week on March
[SPEAKER_03]: 9th, that is the last webinar for this
series.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be at 2 o'clock p.m., and Dr.
Harold Van Ness will be leading that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but part of that will be to address any
remaining questions that might exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think at this point, let's move into
the second portion of the webinar,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'd like to introduce to you our
invited speaker, Dr. Santos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Balinski Santos is an assistant
professor of horticulture with the
[SPEAKER_03]: University of Florida and IFAS.
[SPEAKER_03]: He conducts research on strawberry,
tomato, bell pepper, and increasingly high
[SPEAKER_03]: bush blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He works out of the, oh sugar,
I should have read from the other side,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the research station,
the golf research station at IFAS,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he works specifically with fertilizer,
irrigation, protected agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: with those remaining crops, and
increasingly blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the Gulf Coast Research and
Extension Center, experiment center.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much, Dr. Santos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if I kind of get that introduction a
little bit bobbled, but I'm going to let
[SPEAKER_03]: you take it from here, and people will be
continually logging on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Dr. Santos had asked,
we spoke about this earlier, if you could
[SPEAKER_03]: hold your questions till the end,
or if you want to type them in,
[SPEAKER_03]: go ahead, but we'll take all the questions
at the very end of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks very much, and we'll get
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate the opportunity to be
here today and talk to a very diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: group of colleagues, both in research and
extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate that, and I also
appreciate the fact that in 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Florida, where it's kind of cold
up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys don't fall asleep,
I'm going to try the best to try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: your attention towards this next few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Laura mentioned, part of my
responsibilities at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida are to direct the vegetables and
small fruit horticultural program that
[SPEAKER_02]: focuses on fertilization, water
management, protected ag, and cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for most of our target crops that
include tomatoes, peppers, strawberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries, and musk curbits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we are going to be talking mostly
about strawberries and how the fertigation
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques and some of the hydroponics
have been experimented here in Florida and
[SPEAKER_02]: abroad also, because part of the
activities that we conduct, both research
[SPEAKER_02]: and extension, are not only in Florida,
but also in California, Spain,
[SPEAKER_02]: Argentina, Chile, and other parts of the
world, where we have all the research
[SPEAKER_02]: being conducted right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, we are going to be
focusing today on three basic aspects,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fertigation by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be talking about a little
bit of the concepts of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to be really broad on
this, knowing that previous speakers
[SPEAKER_02]: probably touched a lot of the aspects of
the nutrition and fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later we're going to go to the rate
determination, which is sometimes one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most important aspects and what
relates to this when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: fertigation and fertilization of
strawberries in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the third touch aspect is going
to be touching on some of the diagnostic
[SPEAKER_02]: tools we are using right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been asked to look into not only the
way that we produce strawberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, along with California,
very different to the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deal with strawberries as an annual
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a second crop or a third
crop, like in some cases we have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: north.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also some of the emergent technologies
that some growers are using, not only
[SPEAKER_02]: here, but in other parts of the world,
when it comes to fertigation and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine the best way the crops can
perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within each one of the subjects you're
going to be seeing that we have certain
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects that we're going to be touching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we're going to be kind of
thorough about it and give practical
[SPEAKER_02]: examples of what each one of these aspects
mean and what we've been doing in Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: with regard to each one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at fertigation,
we cannot separate the nutrition aspect
[SPEAKER_02]: from the irrigation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always tell everybody that if there
is one thing that we, when we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilization in general, is that there
are not certain recipes that need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every situation is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that you're going to see
today is that we are not going to give
[SPEAKER_02]: specific recommendations, blanket
recommendations for everybody to do
[SPEAKER_02]: fertigation, as opposed to touching the
principles that take you to those
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations and for you to adjust to
your own programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call fertigation the process by
which we apply fertilizers through the
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing that, we can use two types of
specific fertilizers, the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to use in a liquid matrix,
which is the most common method that is
[SPEAKER_02]: used by the strawberry growers here in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in parts of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we have the hydrosoluble salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are solid salts just diluted in
water, similar to the ones that you buy
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes in the hardware stores,
that you go buy a salt and just dissolve
[SPEAKER_02]: it and apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them have pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, when you're carrying a big
liquid matrix of fertilizer, they charge
[SPEAKER_02]: you a lot more for the cost of taking that
fertilizer to you because they're carrying
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of water with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, these are fashion-made formulas
that are tailored to your specific needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just apply the formula.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about usually
about the formula precipitating to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom of the tank unless it is really
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know exactly what you're applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with the salts, when they're
hydrosoluble in contrast with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that usually people, the more that you
handle this, the more opportunity for
[SPEAKER_02]: error, for human error, that you're going
to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one day somebody is making the
mixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a week, somebody is going to be doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there might be differences on the type
of fertilizer you're really applying in
[SPEAKER_02]: the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, regardless of the formula that
you use, no fertilization program is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be ever efficient if a poor irrigation
program is in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that we've been
formulating to our growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This second aspect is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry growers in Florida are very
efficient handling the water during the
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that translates into good use of the
fertilizer that is applied during that
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we know, and when we talk to our
growers, that usually this process is not
[SPEAKER_02]: a simple process that they can do on their
own without the education that we carry to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the principles that we tell
them all the time is that nutrients only
[SPEAKER_02]: move as far as the water moves those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why a lot of strawberry growers
are very successful in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, many of you might be wondering
how they handle fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a situation like they do in Florida,
well, soil, this is a type of soil that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very sandy, extremely sandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the closest that you're going to find
to a beach without sodium in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it extremely challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, somebody asked me the other day
how we were able to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just tell them that we take a lot of
the hydroponic principles to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's the closest to the hydroponic
system that you're going to find in real
[SPEAKER_02]: life when you got these deep sands
infiltrate really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's challenging to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you have a soil like this,
when growers apply water and have a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: like strawberries that we grow in an
annual hill system like this, when usually
[SPEAKER_02]: we establish the strawberries with
sprinklers irrigation, protect the berries
[SPEAKER_02]: also with the sprinklers, and have one or
two drip tapes like the ones that you see
[SPEAKER_02]: here at the bottom of this slide in each
one of the beds, it creates an opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: to apply fertilizers in a very efficient
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's challenging
because you can have a high risk of
[SPEAKER_02]: leaching fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't believe me that,
I'm just going to leave you with this
[SPEAKER_02]: picture when this is a cross section of a
bed, sandy bed like we have here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the picture on top represents watering
that bed with one drip tape for one hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how quickly the water moves down
without moving farther out on the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when we have to challenge
ourselves to keep those nutrients within
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots zone and making sure that nobody
waters excessively so they can be
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient when they apply fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second picture at the bottom of the
slide represents beds with two drip tapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in both cases, this is one hour of
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the top, in that case, we were able to
achieve 31% coverage of the bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the area of the bed, whereas with two
drip tapes, you get barely 67%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means two-thirds of the bed has been
arbing water when you have one-third of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bed that hasn't been touched by water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be sure that you not only
put the right rate of fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also the placement of that fertilizer
along with the irrigation program has to
[SPEAKER_02]: be efficient for us to make sure that we
make the best use possible of the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources that are put out there in the
field for producing strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, going back a little bit to the
principles that we follow here in Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly, we usually tell our growers
that they shouldn't be irrigating for more
[SPEAKER_02]: than an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is that those pictures that
you just saw, after an hour of irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're probably dumping most of your
fertilizer into the aquifers because it
[SPEAKER_02]: just leaks down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, another important thing that we tell
our growers is that they should have
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring equipment to make sure that
they monitor how much water they have in
[SPEAKER_02]: the beds and knowing when to apply and
when not to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, we're going to see some pictures
of the type of equipment that is being
[SPEAKER_02]: used right now to make sure that the water
is used appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we extensively educate our growers
on knowing the kind of soil that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to calibrate their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to know what the field capacity
is because, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the sands are not equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some sandy areas here that are
very fast, very fine sand that you get the
[SPEAKER_02]: field capacity when the soil is barely in
12%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas there are other areas when you
have a heavier type of sand that work,
[SPEAKER_02]: field capacity is around 18%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need to know exactly what kind of
soil they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even within the same farm,
knowing the pockets of soils that they
[SPEAKER_02]: might have, and I'm going to provide more
details later on on the broad diagnostic
[SPEAKER_02]: of farms and how growers can section that
farm depending on what kind of soil they
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole objective of all this,
obviously, is to keep the water in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to do that, we want to make sure that
our growers at least have one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: two, if not both, pieces of equipment that
allow them to monitor water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, we have two basic pieces of
equipment, tensiometers, which are the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional piece of equipment that
measures water tension in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very decent accuracy,
even though we are disputing this more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more because sometimes in the middle
range, of tensions, you might not have an
[SPEAKER_02]: accuracy that will tell you exactly how
much water you should put out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The disadvantage is that you have to use
one unit per location that you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be collecting data and making sure that
that unit is there and it's clean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not collecting algae and anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely easy to use and very
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are other pieces of
equipment like what you see on the right,
[SPEAKER_02]: here, which is called a time domain
reflectometer, which is relatively
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these units can go anywhere from
500 to thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this handheld unit that gives you
an instant reading of soil volumetric
[SPEAKER_02]: water and has these prongs that go into
the soil that can be calibrated at
[SPEAKER_02]: different depths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can tell you instantly the volume
of water that you have in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, if you know that your soil
field capacity is at 15%, at six inches
[SPEAKER_02]: deep, you immediately get a reading that
tells you that that's what you have over
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another advantage of this unit is that you
can buy one unit or two units for the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a farm manager just going
around and just collecting the volume of
[SPEAKER_02]: water in the soil at the beginning of the
cycles or before the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the downside is that it could be
a little bit unaffordable for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other units that are extremely
more complicated that are based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: same principle or similar principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that that escapes the scope of
what we're trying to do today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to do a seminar on how to
monitor water, but rather to use practical
[SPEAKER_02]: tools to monitor water in a situation when
growers might be struggling to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually when we go into also in farms,
we try to make growers aware of the
[SPEAKER_02]: necessity of knowing what kind of
cultivars they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we found is that cultivars
might respond totally different to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same fertilization and irrigation
programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously varieties that have been
bred in Florida will respond different
[SPEAKER_02]: than varieties that have been bred in
California, just basically because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: been bred in totally different
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the selection pressure will be
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the situation of the California soils
will be different to ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be true for a lot of
varieties that are bred in other regions
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been trying to develop tools that
allow us to tailor different formulas for
[SPEAKER_02]: different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about that a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when it comes to the second part of
the fertigation, soil versus soil
[SPEAKER_02]: sculpture, I realize that the vast
majority of strawberries in the US are
[SPEAKER_02]: grown on the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is an increased movement of
people going into protected culture and
[SPEAKER_02]: going into soil sculpture within those
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires also for us to provide
knowledge to that increasing group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both for the traditional market of
strawberries and also the organic market
[SPEAKER_02]: of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for that, we just have to make sure
that we know the physical and chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: properties of our soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing soils, field capacity,
as I mentioned, wilting point,
[SPEAKER_02]: texture, structure is as important as all
the chemical properties such as organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter content, pH, nutrient content,
salinity, and karate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make sure that our growers
understand that that's extremely important
[SPEAKER_02]: to adjust those fertilization programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to soil sculpture,
you've got three different categories of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil that you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the solid substrates,
which we're going to talk a little bit in
[SPEAKER_02]: the next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the pure hydroponics that are
the plants just in a liquid matrix of
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutritional solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you've got something relatively
new that is called aeroponics,
[SPEAKER_02]: when the plant roots are in the air and
you get a constant mist of water with
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that are sprayed into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, of all this, the solid
substrate is the most common and the most
[SPEAKER_02]: used normally here in the US and other
parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when talking about soilless media,
the basic principle is that we are just
[SPEAKER_02]: replacing the natural soil with a lot of
these materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, many of them are naturally
deficient on a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick whatever soilless media is
out there, and you're always going to find
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies of certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when the know-how comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what kind of media you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that a good soilless media
should provide good root support,
[SPEAKER_02]: good nutrient water retention,
allow gas exchange, and also be a
[SPEAKER_02]: pest-free environment, because it's a way
for us to get away from the fumigation of
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil and other problems that we might
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when it comes to mineral origin
media, you've got pearlite, vermiculite,
[SPEAKER_02]: sand, and rock wool, which are very common
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the organic side, you get all from
very vegetable or animal origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got coconut core, peat,
pine bark, compost, different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: compost, all kinds of compost out there,
and also rice hulls that are usually
[SPEAKER_02]: either used as they are or burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at a lot of these materials,
and as I put in the slide before,
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily the cheapest is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on what kind of needs you
have, what kind of irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilization program, and equipment you
might have in the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an equipment that you can only
fertilize once per day, you might want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that your soilless media adjusts
to that type of regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're going to maybe be
running in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Florida, we have some specific
examples of soilless and controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: containers that are being used for
strawberry production.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a grower field here in Florida
when we get strawberries growing troughs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and those troughs are filled with pine
bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this with drip tape and
fertigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, bags almost very close to the soil
over these concrete blocks when we fill
[SPEAKER_02]: the bags with pine bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you've got other growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have bags that are filled with
coconut core.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, these bags are premixed and bring
the coconut core, and usually it's
[SPEAKER_02]: imported from Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, you have also growers that might
have been struggling in the past and have
[SPEAKER_02]: tables like this, and they might be
reusing those tables for something else,
[SPEAKER_02]: like people that had nurseries before,
and we've been converting some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: people to producing strawberries on top of
the tables with substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, other people have been looking into
vertical production with these vertical
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might save a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, usually when you run into these
lower levels, the light quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: intensity is a problem, and strawberries
might not flower too well down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, from the first two, three,
four, five levels, depending on where you
[SPEAKER_02]: are, and the type of plastic cover that
you have on top, you might be very
[SPEAKER_02]: successful producing the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, moving on, when we look at the
injection equipment for fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you usually are talking about two or three
classical pieces of equipment that are
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient, and some of them are very
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has pros and cons with regard to the
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first piece of equipment that I want
to show you is what they call the Venturi
[SPEAKER_02]: suction injector.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very simple system.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the problem is that when you have
a system like this, as the pressure of the
[SPEAKER_02]: water line changes, you might be changing
the pressure and the injection of this
[SPEAKER_02]: each one of these Venturis into the line,
which is going to end giving you a very
[SPEAKER_02]: variable fertilizer rate that you're going
to be applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is a very simple method,
very inexpensive for a lot of growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they require to monitor the injection
of each fertilizer more efficiently than
[SPEAKER_02]: they would do with a system like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what usually the very constant
injection, they could be both hydraulic,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the one on the left, or they could be
electric, like the one on the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a company that is called Dosatron,
that's where we're taking the name from,
[SPEAKER_02]: no endorsement intended here, but these
systems inject a very constant rate at a
[SPEAKER_02]: very broad range of water pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you go from 20 PSI to 10 PSI,
you're going to continue injecting the
[SPEAKER_02]: same concentration of fertilizer into the
stream, which is going to allow you to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the same rate, it's just that the
irrigation and the fertigation process is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to last longer if the pressure
drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for those of you who might have plenty
of money to go into it, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, there are some computerized
consoles that do all this for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't have to mess around a lot
with this system because they adjust the
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilization throughout the season by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have a program that goes into,
but these are a lot more expensive than
[SPEAKER_02]: all those methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that we want to make sure
is, and take home message, is that more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive not necessarily means better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends also how you set up your system
and how committed you are, to be precise,
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of the fertilization that you're
going to be applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: In many cases, when you got hydro soluble
fertilizers, you got the multi-tank
[SPEAKER_02]: injection point, when you got one tank for
every type of fertilizer that you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be applying out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in this tank in the left,
in this case, you got the acids,
[SPEAKER_02]: like phosphoric acid is being injected
through that tank, and this one you got
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients that are being injected.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other cases, you got phosphates and
sulfates, and in the other one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea for this is that you don't mix a
lot of these fertilizers because they can
[SPEAKER_02]: precipitate to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a hydro soluble fertilizer,
you need to separate them and make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you inject the right proportion of
all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very common system that is used
in greenhouses all over the world when
[SPEAKER_02]: salts are added to water instead of ready
to use liquid solutions like we use in the
[SPEAKER_02]: open field in Florida and many parts of
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving on to rate determination,
which is the second part of our
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation today, you're going to see a
lot of now practical examples of how we
[SPEAKER_02]: calculate rates for strawberry production
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put this slide here so it's
refreshing to you what the micro or
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients are, and a lot of these
formulas sometimes might not have all the
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients, and they need to be
supplemented depending on the soil needs
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even more important, even as important
as rate determination, also we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that we know the sources,
the placement of the fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the timing when all this is going to
be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to make sure that we sometimes,
in some cases or some micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: like for example zinc or iron or sulfur,
we use blanket recommendations because
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we don't have specific
calibrated tests that will tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly how much we need in that place,
or you might have a piece of land that is
[SPEAKER_02]: brand new that nobody has done any
strawberries in that part of the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you might need to use blanket
recommendations while you calibrate the
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any ways, when you are determining the
specific rate of application, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that you take into account the
crop requirement, the leachage in the
[SPEAKER_02]: losses through volatilization,
and chemical and biological immobilization
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil, and that's going to give you
a rough application rate that you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these tools, we take it into account
when determining the best rate for
[SPEAKER_02]: producing, for applying and fertilizing
and producing strawberries in our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now at the same time that we say that,
we mentioned earlier that different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars with different growing rates and
plant architecture is going to play a
[SPEAKER_02]: major role in how much fertilizer you put
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we focus a lot of our attention here in
Florida to looking at pre-plant and early
[SPEAKER_02]: N and P fertilization, as well as at the
adjustments during the season of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: and potassium throughout the production
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give you a clear picture of what we do
in that regard, we concentrate a lot on
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen and potassium because these two
are the most used nutrients, or the most
[SPEAKER_02]: applied nutrients in our situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen is usually applied 100% through
the drip tapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, some people might apply a
little bit in pre-plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six years ago, this was around 60% of the
acreage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we are only below 20% of the
acreage of people that apply pre-plant
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We supplement that with drip later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, the rates were between 20 and 50
pounds per acre of nitrogen that were
[SPEAKER_02]: applied before the drip tapes were in.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of potassium, 100% is
delivered through the drip tapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this has been changing in the
recent years because of the environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: concerns that we have in terms of nitrate
moving into the ground waters and also
[SPEAKER_02]: implementing best management practices for
the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is not a single best
management practice better than rising
[SPEAKER_02]: prices of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, I say that in a way that sounds
sarcastic, but that has created a more
[SPEAKER_02]: conscience throughout growers of how to
use fertilizer more efficiently because
[SPEAKER_02]: the prices have been going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the year 2000, one ton of fertilizer
was below $200 a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, fertilizers are above $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has created a conscience that we need
to be more efficient applying fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very common fertilization program here
in Florida is using one to one and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds of nitrogen per acre per day,
which is going to add up to around 150 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 175 pounds per acre per season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, our season starts in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are done at the beginning of March.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very short season because our
market is the winter market.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, other states take over the
production in the state and we become
[SPEAKER_02]: really hot to produce strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that short season, we apply usually
between 150 to 175 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium is a little higher because
people have the perception that applying
[SPEAKER_02]: more potassium at the end is going to
increase fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to illustrate you on
that regard in the next slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we are more conscious right now
about looking at phosphorus in the early
[SPEAKER_02]: stages of production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when it comes to using starter
fertilizer for applying nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've conducted research in the past where
we compare no application of pre-plant
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer versus the application of 50
pounds per acre of pre-plant nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: using ammonium nitrate as the source.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found in that research
consistently over time is that there was
[SPEAKER_02]: no significant difference across the board
in any of the months when we compared the
[SPEAKER_02]: production of strawberries by not using
starter fertilizer or using starter
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was done over a period of three
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is important because it means not
only that the growers might be saving
[SPEAKER_02]: around 17 to 20 bucks an acre on the
application plus the labor and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else, but also it's 50 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: You multiply that by 10,000 acres,
that's a tremendous amount of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: that was just sitting there and doing
absolutely nothing for the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, a lot of growers were moving
out of the business of applying pre-plant
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen to the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they did is they started connecting
the drip tape as early as possible to the
[SPEAKER_02]: crop and started injecting nitrogen
fertilizer as soon as the plant was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that for the first 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we also conducted research looking
at this, but this time we made it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more complicated and we took two
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two varieties are standards for us,
Florida Strawberry Festival, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: most grown variety here in Florida,
and that is the red line, and Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiance, that is the blue line.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found is that these two varieties
that have two totally different
[SPEAKER_02]: architectures react totally different to
that initial fertilizer rate that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we compare 0, 0.5,
one, and one and a half pounds per acre
[SPEAKER_02]: per day in those two varieties for the
first 10 days after transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We injected that amount and we collected
the early yields of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found is obviously with zero there
was no difference, but there were two
[SPEAKER_02]: totally different patterns as you increase
to 0.5 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see here that Strawberry Festival
continues increasing its early yield as
[SPEAKER_02]: you move to one pound and stabilizes after
that, whereas with Florida Radiance,
[SPEAKER_02]: the maximum yield was obtained with 0.5
pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that applied more than that,
there were no significant differences from
[SPEAKER_02]: that obtained at 0.5 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is giving us more confirmation that
we need to design more tailor-made
[SPEAKER_02]: formulas for specific cultivars and taking
into account that many growers apply as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as one and one and a half pounds per
acre across the board for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have to come up with ways to
differentiate across the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the research that we've conducted
had a lot to do with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're seeing right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at other two varieties and then we
started applying nitrogen throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: season, which is different from what you
just saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you just saw previously was nitrogen
at the beginning, starting in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started looking at nitrogen throughout
the season now in two different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to make a note here that regardless
of the source, we didn't find any
[SPEAKER_02]: significant differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were using calcium nitrate and other
nitrogen sources, we were getting similar
[SPEAKER_02]: responses as you're going to see in a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found again is that there are
different responses across cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of the source or the fertilizer
that you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some varieties like this blue line,
Winter Dawn, which is a very small plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: all it requires is three quarters of a
pound of nitrogen per acre per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a big variety like Strawberry
Festival needs to get at least to 1.25
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds per acre per day to maximize early
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at that, we say, okay,
what about if we start comparing this to a
[SPEAKER_02]: newer variety like Florida Radiance?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a similar study when we were
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that, again, we had two very
different patterns in the two varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiance and Festival, when Radiance was
maximizing at 0.75, three quarters of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound and Festival was getting the maximum
at 1.25.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's giving us extra confirmation,
what is even more important, that extra
[SPEAKER_02]: half pound per acre per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were applying Radiance without
needing it, it might mean 60 pounds per
[SPEAKER_02]: acre per season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a tremendous investment that you
don't need when you're producing Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about nitrogen and potassium
ratios during the season?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been told and led to believe that by
switching potassium towards the end in
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries is a good thing to increase
fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been doing studies when we are
looking at the traditional grower practice
[SPEAKER_02]: that is applying a formula like 604 or 704
during the season until mid-December and
[SPEAKER_02]: switching later to a heavy potassium
formula like 406 or 408 towards the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly to improve quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, research has been conducted in that
regard and what we found out consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: is that plant diameter, when you go in
different ratios, 1 to 1, 1 to 1.25 and 1
[SPEAKER_02]: to 1.5 nitrogen to potassium, there were
no significant differences across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when we moved to total fruit
weight of the plants, there was the same
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern that was occurring with plant
diameter when there were no differences
[SPEAKER_02]: among all the ratios that were used.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same occurred when we look into the
soluble solid content or the bricks of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no differences of the ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that when I'm talking the ratios
here, growers tend to switch to 1 to 1.5
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds during the end of the season to
increase quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that wasn't needed in any of the
three varieties that we tested
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently in the last two years here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there goes the myth that potassium
heavy at the end increases the quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: the total fruit number and weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did find, and this was expected,
were differences across the cultivars and
[SPEAKER_02]: that was expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to changing nitrogen,
nitrogen and potassium during the season,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can conclude that we can use the same
fertilizer rate throughout the season
[SPEAKER_02]: provided that you provided the correct
rate from the beginning and the plant has
[SPEAKER_02]: developed a very good rooting system to go
down there and get the fertilizer that you
[SPEAKER_02]: already have been applying in the beds and
you're keeping all those nutrients without
[SPEAKER_02]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, also we are looking into making sure
that we adjust the practices for specific
[SPEAKER_02]: growers and that growers design programs
that make sense for their needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how do we design these programs in
the sense of how we monitor all this
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the diagnostic tools are going
to be a tremendous help for us and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of the visual assessment has
been done during the season and nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: beats your own eyes, but the problem is
that usually when you see a deficiency,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it has taken a toll on the crop
and you see a situation like in this
[SPEAKER_02]: picture on the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a severe deficiency here and you
want to make sure that you get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant before the leaves turn this yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, some deficiencies cannot be
seen at plain sight and we need to monitor
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually tell our growers that there are
several tools out there that they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that they have and no specific
tool is going to help you to do a one fits
[SPEAKER_02]: all type of diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you need your own eyes out there
looking at the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you need also to do probably some
kind of colorimetric test.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, you might do the foliar
test to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, the petiole sap has been
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are severe contradictions out there
on when is the right time to use a petiole
[SPEAKER_02]: sap test and whether this is a really
valuable tool to measure deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_02]: plant because some people argue that when
you have high concentrations in the
[SPEAKER_02]: petiole, petioles act as reservoirs for
nutrients and not necessarily means what
[SPEAKER_02]: is going through the vascular tissue to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing to keep an eye on and
not only to use petioles sap as a only
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people also look at colorimetric
measurements to determine the greenness of
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves, especially if looking for
nitrogen magnification.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use this pad meter which measures the
greenness of the leaves and those are just
[SPEAKER_02]: two of the most common tools that are used
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when you look at the nutritional
composition of the leaves, usually nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: beats a good leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The downside of this is that obviously by
the time you collect the samples and send
[SPEAKER_02]: it to the lab and you get the results
back, several days might go by and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: why the proactive approach of making sure
that your solutions are accurate,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have the right pH, that you have
the right electrical conductivity of the
[SPEAKER_02]: solution, which by the way we haven't
touched a lot, but usually you get certain
[SPEAKER_02]: targets like for the pH of the solution
you don't want to go above 7.6 or even too
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make sure that you have the right
solution out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to depend on what kind of
media you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in the soil or if you're
growing in a media that captures or
[SPEAKER_02]: retains a lot of those nutrients,
that might give you more leeway in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of what kind of solution you might want to
apply out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, the electrical
conductivity of the solution, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want it to be too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's particularly a problem in
places when you have very high EC of the
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, here in Florida, in our
station, our water is 0.7 deci Siemens per
[SPEAKER_02]: meter, the electrical conductivity of our
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we apply fertilizer, we usually
don't want to go above 2 because
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries are extremely sensitive to
any solution that is applied to them
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently above 2 deci Siemens per
meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure that you keep a
balance and that's going to have a direct
[SPEAKER_02]: influence on what frequency of
fertilization you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: If to obtain the given fertilizer rate
that you want, it's going to take that
[SPEAKER_02]: solution above 2, then you're probably
better off lowering the concentration of
[SPEAKER_02]: your solution and applying it more
frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those are aspects that we work with
growers to make sure that they have the
[SPEAKER_02]: right program in place so they don't go
overboard and start seeing salinity
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and pH disorders in the soil that
are going to start showing in the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these problems and also blocking
the absorption of certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevertheless, we have a sufficiency range
for strawberries that our university has
[SPEAKER_02]: put together in our production handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get certain guidelines,
no written stone, but certain guidelines
[SPEAKER_02]: on how much nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur, iron, manganese, zinc,
boron, copper, and molybdenum the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: needs on a dry weight basis when it comes
to adequate range of fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this is available either through our
website here in my program or the
[SPEAKER_02]: Extension website of the university that
is free of charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be accessed from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody has a question about it later
on, I would like that table to get to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either get a copy of the
presentation or to access the website,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I will be happy to direct you to the
right spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Below that table, we have another table.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned earlier, we use all these
measurements, all these diagnostic tools
[SPEAKER_02]: to complement each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a table that also shows you the
perceived sufficiency ranges for our
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions for nitrate, nitrogen in the
perils, and also for potassium in the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that is available at the same time,
and both tables are together like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just want to make sure that we
design the right programs for our growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, towards the end, and we are in the
last few slides here, we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate also on what is out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know a lot of people use area
photographs as a tool to diagnose
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms, and this is extensively used in
agronomic crops, when people corn,
[SPEAKER_02]: soybean, and other crops out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a tool that is being used
increasingly more in vegetables now,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when they're growing in
extended areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are using some more actively
nitrification inhibitors just to slow down
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of conversion from NH4 to
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, more and more people are using
crop refractance measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a sophisticated method to
determine the colors of the plant and what
[SPEAKER_02]: is reflecting from the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some fellow scientists have
been working actively on this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I wouldn't be surprised in the next
few years, this method is used a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: extensively in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the methods that has been used here
in Florida, especially for people who have
[SPEAKER_02]: very large strawberry areas, talking above
100 acres, is using the aerial infrared
[SPEAKER_02]: photographs.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see in this picture,
it gives you a good idea of what the high
[SPEAKER_02]: vigor areas in your field are and what the
low areas are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually, that is tied up to the
specific properties of the soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: specific practices of that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in this specific case,
you're going to see the areas in green
[SPEAKER_02]: that represent the low vigor areas of that
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And reading a little bit of the narrative,
of this picture, those were areas that
[SPEAKER_02]: were both either poor fumigated or have
very limited drainage situations in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a tool that has been used more
actively now to know what you have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field and make sure that you make
adjustments either on that season or for
[SPEAKER_02]: next season to do amendments pinpointed to
specific blocks of land of your field.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see here, in the left side of
this picture, you got nine different
[SPEAKER_02]: fields, all of them with very different
vigor with the same variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that allows that grower to say,
okay, this is a very low spot,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a very high spot, or this is a
spot that has higher organic matter than
[SPEAKER_02]: the other, and that allows you to make
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, towards the end now, we are looking
more increasingly into looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: effect of nutrients and growth and
quality, not only the traditional nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: and potassium, but also I mentioned that
we've been focusing even more on
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is because even our soils have
a lot of phosphorus available,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we see phosphorus addition
increasing the quality of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's probably because when the
young transplant is putting in the beds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have enough phosphorus around
the root zone for the new roots to absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: it at the given time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might have phosphorus in the
environment, but might not have it where
[SPEAKER_02]: you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working on that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we're doing is
working actively on management of soilless
[SPEAKER_02]: culture to make sure that growers have
what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every specific soilless culture in
this medium has specific characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that we pinpoint
to them what are the practices that they
[SPEAKER_02]: need for specific conditions that they
might have in the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got any further questions beyond
this seminar, I'm putting my email there
[SPEAKER_02]: so anybody can feel free to expand over
this and discuss this a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if any other subject was left out,
I would be more than happy to answer your
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just allow me a couple days for it because
I keep traveling all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes I might not even be in the
country when I might be answering some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will be happy to do it because this
kind of exchange with people from other
[SPEAKER_02]: states, from colleagues, researchers,
and extensionists is what really enriches
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of gaining knowledge and
generating technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: For our growers and all the growers in the
US.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I'm going to leave it for
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate your attention today and
your patience with all this presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Santos, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Laura speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have a couple of questions that
people have typed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine there's a few other questions
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you in the audience,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have them, please type them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Jeff Miller asks whether or not
you've compared the use of calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_03]: with urea or ammonium sources of nitrogen
for trickle solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned before, we've compared
those sources and talking about calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrate and ammonium sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have found no significant
differences in the way that it's used for
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we were talking about other crops,
it might make a whole lot of a difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially blueberries that we know that
respond a lot better to NO3 sources rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than ammoniacal sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of our strawberries and
the way that growers handle it,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rates that we use, we haven't found
any significant differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: No significant differences across the
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beginning portion of you started
talking about ratios of N to K,
[SPEAKER_03]: where K was less than a one to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking, I think, more about K
being a higher ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you mention if you checked those
ratios where K was actually less?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have checked those ratios before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we decided to leave that out of the
research because in preliminary studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: we found out that those ratios that
correspond to less than one pound per acre
[SPEAKER_02]: per day of potassium really start taking a
toll on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually, from the condition that the
growers have here in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: growers tend to over-apply fertilizer,
not to under-apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by looking at those ratios of
preliminary research that we conducted
[SPEAKER_02]: told us that, yes, we didn't need to go
lower than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rather to compare one, one and a
quarter, one and a half pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium during the season, which is the
most common practice for those growers
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have one more question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you mentioned that the goal
for the pH of your solution would be a 6.2
[SPEAKER_03]: of a low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the maximum would be somewhere
between 7.6 and 8.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the extremes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you try to have a nutritional solution
that doesn't go below 6.5 and doesn't go
[SPEAKER_02]: higher than 7.3 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to deal for a short time with
a solution that is 7.6, 7.8, it's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that tends to accumulate over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a given point in time when you're
applying that, you might be fine,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if the plants are big and
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can take it really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you try to stay close to
neutrality as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another question.
