[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now my pleasure to introduce Dr.
Charles Yarish from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Yarish received his Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: from Rutgers in 1976 and then joined the
faculty at UConn in the same year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been adjunct professor at Stony
Brook University, visiting scientist at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Biologische Anstalt Helgoland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize to any German speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visiting professor at the University of
Roenigen in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a guest professor at Shanghai Ocean
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been an invited participant to
symposia across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: At UConn he's developed an internationally
known laboratory for seaweed research and
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's most interested in the development of
integrated multi-trophic aquaculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient bio-extraction systems for
coastal management.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's published extensively and has
received numerous extramural grants and
[SPEAKER_00]: awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also an avid scuba diver and has
logged hundreds of research dives across
[SPEAKER_00]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he taught me something very
interesting and valuable last night at
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a fellow tall person he let me know
that you can get a doctor's note to get
[SPEAKER_00]: extended leg room on airplanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have to use that at some
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join me in welcoming Dr. Yarish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like for this audience a fish out
of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll try to give everybody a little
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: First as a disclaimer we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: a major industry in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I was up against a number of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a number of years ago I said to
myself while I was sitting on sabbatical
[SPEAKER_02]: in a friend's lab what are the impediments
for seaweed aquaculture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why hasn't it developed in North America?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I slowly realized that it had to do
with people trying to hide things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secrecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have things open source things
are just lost in the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've taken it upon myself that all
our work gets published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also when possible we have many
technical reports and videos for keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: items open source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And open source means aspects of
cultivation initially and other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was something we were up against.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also I had to make it relevant to where I
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I live in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked on four continents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Introduced seaweed farming to East Africa
and Tanzania and Kenya.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had to bring something back to the
state of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again that's a challenge because
most people don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweeds other than sometimes it's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has to do with an education
campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a science coach chair for a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: EPA program called the Long Island Sound
Study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for about 18 years I started learning
the language of coastal managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put two and two together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said look if I could show that there's a
need for doing something maybe I could get
[SPEAKER_02]: people excited especially people who have
very nice homes on Long Island Sound and
[SPEAKER_02]: are absolutely the NIMBY mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've used people who were guinea
pigs who lived in the towns of Greenwich
[SPEAKER_02]: very exclusive town in southwestern
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to get from the stakeholders you
know what are they interested in seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tell them business they're not
interested because they have certain ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: about their little beach a little bit of
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making things relevant was really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding what the needs were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding the conflicts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you how we have progressed
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we take a look Long Island Sound
the watershed of the Sound is a watershed
[SPEAKER_02]: that drains over somewhere between 25 and
35 million people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headwaters of the Connecticut River up
in Canada that water goes into Long Island
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the big neighbor to our west New
York much of the water that comes out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the East River will go into Long Island
Sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it goes into the Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a lot of inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the work that we are dealing with
deals with people and people are important
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the equation as many ecologists
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the number one problem that we have in
our region has to do with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen loading is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had point source loadings from
sewage treatment plants and then we have
[SPEAKER_02]: nonpoint source.
[SPEAKER_02]: As sewage treatment plants have improved
the quality of effluent that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing in their coastal waters or into
riverine systems then the nonpoint sources
[SPEAKER_02]: are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nonpoint sources coming through the
watershed and another nonpoint source that
[SPEAKER_02]: is very difficult to deal with has to do
with aerial deposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so today nitrogen is the focus and
it's the focus has to do with a major
[SPEAKER_02]: issue in our region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called hypoxia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low oxygen conditions in the summer months
hypoxia sets up and then in the far end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the sound just by the nature of the
bathymetry of the sound the waters in the
[SPEAKER_02]: far west there are very eutrophic and that
leads to hypoxic situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so coastal managers are beside
themselves because they have had their
[SPEAKER_02]: sewage treatment plants upgraded and they
still are experiencing significant hypoxia
[SPEAKER_02]: every single year.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it has to do with wind conditions
but you have to remember in Long Island
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound we have a legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 400 years of human interference of
the sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: That legacy is something that we have to
deal with all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't only deal with present
nitrogen inputs but we also are dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with what's the legacy and the sediments
and other issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you let too much nutrients in your
coastal waters that's an algal bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having brown tides there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the consequence of that these algal
blooms besides not able to eat the
[SPEAKER_02]: shellfish you have fish kills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypoxia also leads to fish kills and we
have them in the sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some very significant problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm very interested in managing the
nitrogen problem because as we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: work in the sea we can't add fertilizers
into our water.
[SPEAKER_02]: On land you need two very important
commodities for your agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: One has to do with fresh water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second part has to do with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to add that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our systems there I felt that trying to
understand the nitrogen cycle was
[SPEAKER_02]: important and managed the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the work that I was doing up in
the Gulf of Maine and also in China I
[SPEAKER_02]: realized that fed aquaculture has a good
opportunity for people who are interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in growing seaweed and shellfish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I worked with a team that we coined
the term integrated multi-trophic
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaculture which combines fed aquaculture
of fish and shrimp with extractive
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaculture of shellfish and seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that now has taken off by itself
globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a global approach of managing the fed
aquaculture systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not going to grow fish in Long
Island Sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have enough problems with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came up with the other part of the
equation, nutrient removal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we coined this term nutrient
bio-extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it and after you grow it you take
it out of the water and then you have
[SPEAKER_02]: something called a commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can you do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you'll see in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at plant aquaculture today,
I mean it's not like terrestrial
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaculture, but 27 million metric tons is
the production according to FAO.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at that plant production we're
growing anywhere from 8 to 11 to 12
[SPEAKER_02]: percent per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the growth area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asia is looking to the North American
market for a very significant market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also looking at the North
American growers because they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring back to their middle class in China,
in Korea, and Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to bring back high quality
product that's part of their culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look today at our global seaweed
production for the world, you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: there are five big seaweeds there to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a red seaweed called porphyra or
poropia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big dollar amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the wrapping on your sushi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very mature industry and it's very
significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of work on plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has been done on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked on that in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is another one, the kelp quartile
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fairly substantive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kelp is principally deals with
two genera.
[SPEAKER_02]: One called saccharina and the other one
called undaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are kelp and we'll see some pictures
of kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grassillary is a red seaweed and that has
its own industrial applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again you'll see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capoficus and eucuma in many lesser
developed countries, they are very
[SPEAKER_02]: significant because that's the principal
source of carrageenins globally from those
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's that other quart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at the countries, you can see
the global seaweed production is dominated
[SPEAKER_02]: by Asian countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: China, Korea, and Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: China is the number one aquaculture
country in the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a massive production.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use most of it there but they're
looking for production from North America
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the proportion of seaweed
aquaculture to the global aquaculture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're about 27, 28% of the whole
global approach there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been very mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point back in the 2000 it was 48%
before fed aquaculture of fish and shrimp
[SPEAKER_02]: came aboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are demands and opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of these come with a price tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important because if you are
able to develop and work with your
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, the feedback is for basic
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I will show you is how some basic
science I worked on in the 1980s,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I pulled that out of the hat for
where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are all applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: They touch everybody from the time you get
up in the morning to the clothes that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're wearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are seaweeds in your everyday life
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the obstacles to aquaculture?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to write something like this down
for myself because, you know, in 2008 we
[SPEAKER_02]: had no commercial seaweed farms in North
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were the conflicts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important to go through
these conflicts and check them off one at
[SPEAKER_02]: a time and deal with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest issue has to do with coastal
zone conflicts, other uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to deal with that,
whether it's recreational boating in the
[SPEAKER_02]: air shore environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're dealing with commercial boat
traffic, you've got to deal with that and
[SPEAKER_02]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Permitting is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dealing, when we started our work,
bringing it to the private sector,
[SPEAKER_02]: the state of Connecticut, like all other
United States coastal states, had no
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations for seaweed farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the managers all said, well,
you can't do it because we have no
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's economic development and we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have good markets to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Processing is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you see there, culture and breeding
technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the area that I'm excited in
being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to learn from you all because
that, to me, is going to be the next
[SPEAKER_02]: generation of where we're going to go in
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Connecticut was the first state in the
United States to come up with regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: for seaweed farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to find a place to house it in
Connecticut state agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it into an agency for aquaculture,
part of our Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I would love it there,
but it was better than anyplace else and
[SPEAKER_02]: we worked on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got students from the University of
Connecticut School of Law working with
[SPEAKER_02]: School of Business students, two students
who worked over a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bill through the legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both sides of the aisle agreed to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we have a follow-up of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another bill in the legislature
with a colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy,
[SPEAKER_02]: a state senator.
[SPEAKER_02]: His father was Ted Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he really understands it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he just introduced a bill through the
legislature promoting one type of seaweed
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaculture, kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also bringing this, the kelp aquaculture
added value in nitrogen trading program in
[SPEAKER_02]: the state and also biofuel applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to work with legislators when
you're introducing something new to the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had three sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to emphasize three sides
because I was told you can't do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after almost two and a half years,
three years working with city,
[SPEAKER_02]: state, and federal agencies, we got a
permit to put a seaweed farm in the East
[SPEAKER_02]: River.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a sign on a number of things,
documents saying that it would not go into
[SPEAKER_02]: the food chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will keep security on it and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city government was very worried about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were worried about somebody going out
there, pilfering our stuff, and think they
[SPEAKER_02]: got gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we dealt with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had a site.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call that site the Bronx River Estuary
site in part because we had a settlement
[SPEAKER_02]: fund that the USEPA won.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was funds for our work
through the National Fish and Wildlife
[SPEAKER_02]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have two other sites in the
western quadrant of Long Island Sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other site in the sound there
towards the central area of the sound just
[SPEAKER_02]: east of New Haven, Connecticut,
called the Thimble Island sites there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to introduce you to those
three sites because they were the guinea
[SPEAKER_02]: pigs for getting things started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we're dealing with nutrients and
coastal waters, we're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem that takes place all year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just like in agriculture,
you have crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said we're going to work with seaweed
crops that are summer crops and winter
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we settled on one particular crop
because I was able to easily propagate
[SPEAKER_02]: that and bring it up into developing seed
stock rapidly for our farms in the Long
[SPEAKER_02]: Island Sound region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a red seaweed called
Grassellaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Economic value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, that's a driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can talk all you want about ecosystem
services.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have entrepreneurs
interested, you're not going anyplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sit down with farmers, give them an
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tell them they have to go back
to school and show me a business plan
[SPEAKER_02]: before they get any other help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they look at me, where's this guy
coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important to understand your
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Grassellaria, we had to develop the
technology of providing seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked with microscopic stages,
spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided that was too costly,
too time consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we started propagating things
vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we can do that, we signed off
at lab scale, a small test tube to work to
[SPEAKER_02]: tank systems outside, four cubic meter
tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was our seed stock for our farm
systems throughout the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this picture tells it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the top left-hand quadrant there,
you see little bundles of Grassellaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another story because we had to
figure out where to grow it in the East
[SPEAKER_02]: River in the water column.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every site is very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put out little bundles, 20-gram
bundles, and then the picture to your
[SPEAKER_02]: right shows you what happens after a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the size of a soccer ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you notice, there's nothing else
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were able to get the sweet spot,
where in the water column to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to take care of any
particular contaminating organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we showed the folks in New York City,
yes, we can do it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were very surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, after four years, we're getting
questions back from the city, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: the state of New York, the Department of
Environmental Conservation, about now
[SPEAKER_02]: expanding that approach to other areas
that are coastal communities for New York
[SPEAKER_02]: State.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Grassellaria, look at the growth rate
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That rivals terrestrial plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get growth up to 6.5% per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: During certain times of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sites is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The driver for the Bronx River site,
or East River site there, that driver is
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have the largest sewage treatment
plants in the state of New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually in North America, right on the
East River.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen is a huge driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got massive growth rates right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also did some N15 work to trace where
the nutrients were coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it human-derived nutrients from sewage
treatment plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it from the sediments or the
watershed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done that and traced that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you take a look at a 16.5% growth
rate, when you show this to somebody,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's growth rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that is equivalent to,
we've done this now on our time,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's equivalent to production in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have developed a few strains,
or actually dozens of strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: of a native seaweed species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along the way, we found out a non-native
was introduced to the region that was
[SPEAKER_02]: taking over the Long Island Sound region,
as well as all of the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we only work with native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do DNA work to work with these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're working on a business model,
you can see how much you can produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll be able to get your cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the amount we actually
produce per month in July for our Bronx
[SPEAKER_02]: site, our Long Island Sound site there,
365 kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use long lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are ropes suspended in the water
column.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we work with 100-meter lines there,
365 kilos per month.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very significant there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Long Island Sound site, much less
nutrients as you're going to the east of
[SPEAKER_02]: the hot spots in the west, it has much
less, but still very significant
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at nitrogen removal,
because I have to get people excited about
[SPEAKER_02]: things, nitrogen removal is very
significant in the sites as you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: far to the west to New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see their differences between
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has to do with temperature
response right there, as well as sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nitrogen removal, is very important for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the amount of nitrogen
removal per hectare per month,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the spacing of your long
lines there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was important.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time coastal managers
were given a tool that they can use to
[SPEAKER_02]: promote a form of farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we'll call it farming now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be doing ecosystem
services, but bringing in entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with Grassalaria, we've tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greatly there, there are some issues that
we have to be cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Associations with certain types of
bacteria has been a problem, because those
[SPEAKER_02]: bundles are a cornucopia for different
animals living in the bundle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And properly working with the HACCP plans,
we can give our growers an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with those issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the big grower is the kelp,
saccharina.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a global seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the North American one is called
saccharina latissima.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called a sugar kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been known for centuries in northern
Europe as a very good feed for your
[SPEAKER_02]: animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people would also eat this
particular sugar kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It occurs in both the Atlantic Ocean,
the North Atlantic, as well as the North
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're dealing with a global species
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does have value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, look at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature is when temperatures are
below 15 degrees Centigrade, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: which coordinates nicely with the
Grassalaria, because it stops growing at
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, doesn't die, but stops growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This organism here grows in the dead of
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is important, because that's the
lowest usage of the coastal zone in North
[SPEAKER_02]: America, the dead of winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you grow kelp?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any manuals available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we've done, we've had to
initiate laboratory cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to figure out how to get our
propagules.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call these propagule spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really had to understand the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the basic biology was worked on by my
lab back in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to get those published
papers out, train new students,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are, working at the levels of
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the most important driver is going to
be temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done work in biogeography.
[SPEAKER_02]: So temperature is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every site we do profiles of temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put out temperature monitors for our
farmers today instead of asking them to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have hobos, underwater sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We set those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know the variation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kelp like to grow in the dead of
winter, so we need to get our seed stock
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally in the December, January,
and February period, because that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: time when the kelp are doing one thing
that is found all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are soaking up their nutrients in
December, January, and February in
[SPEAKER_02]: anticipation of being nutrient starved
when there's a bloom of phytoplankton,
[SPEAKER_02]: which can take up nutrients more
effectively than a large structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: a multicellular structure because the
surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting the seed stock out early was
important so they can soak up the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: because as soon as the lights go on in
March, April, and May, the growth of the
[SPEAKER_02]: kelp is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It rivals anything that you have,
maybe better in the terrestrial
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get at least a low ion sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have growth there upwards of five to 10
centimeters per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The giant kelp on the west coast grows up
to two thirds of a meter per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're dealing with fast-growing
multicellular organisms, but we need
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of classical botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know your life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kelp has two phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phase that you see that you can pick
up, you can buy it in the supermarket,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: The production phase is the macroscopic
phase, the sporophyte phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the phase that is actually involved in
governing the geographic distribution of
[SPEAKER_02]: the seaweed has to do with the microscopic
phase, the gametophyte phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on this gametophyte phase there,
you can see here, this is a female
[SPEAKER_02]: gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the male gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each are the results of a myospore that is
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 50-50 is the ratio of myospores,
males, females.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get female filaments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got male filaments.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all microscopic, very,
very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Female filaments are more robust,
fatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Male filaments are much finer right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the stage that is
essential, governs the life cycle for the
[SPEAKER_02]: kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this stage, after you get egg
formation in the female gametophyte,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sperm are attracted by the eggs by a
pheromone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pheromones have been isolated in
pots per trillion in the sea there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're dealing with a very interesting
mating system here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a young sporophyte here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this young sporophyte will
develop into the adult plant here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another important part of the plant is the
reproductive tissue of the adult plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called sorus tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this tissue here literally produces
per plant thousands, actually probably
[SPEAKER_02]: close to over a million spores during the
sporing season, which is for our region in
[SPEAKER_02]: the springtime and also in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you take that biology and move
it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you see what my first grower,
a guinea pig that I used up in coastal
[SPEAKER_02]: Maine, this is a fellow named Paul
Dobbins.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came to me and he said, look,
we grow shellfish, but we think we could
[SPEAKER_02]: develop a product with seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wrote three grants for him,
federal grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I sent them on his way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to show you this because
these are the kinds of plants that we work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is the reproductive tissue called the
sorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of the sorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these little black spots,
these are just spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: One graduate student I had back in 1989,
she actually counted all the spores for
[SPEAKER_02]: plants as part of her thesis work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought it was important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to know how many are released,
where it's all going, is now what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually can trace this in the plankton
by the DNA signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting it to spore, and right here
basically is you collect reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: material from a donor population and you
clean the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can get a solution of spores
of a certain concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can then isolate males and
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your seed bank, where you can
always go back to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, what you do is you
basically take your spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the dark, you see PVC spools that
have thread wrapped around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of our spools has about 100
meters of line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put these spools after they're seeded,
which takes place anywhere from 18 to 20
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, we put them in fish tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I get the fish tanks from?
[SPEAKER_02]: I go out on sale, Petco, get my tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we set up a prototype system called a
nursery system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nursery system right over here,
this is a prototype of my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to put at least six to eight
spools in a tank, which has a cold water
[SPEAKER_02]: circuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We changed the light levels as the plants
are maturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was work that I knew that we could
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we went from a small lab nursery
that today can produce 6,000 meters of
[SPEAKER_02]: line to our first company nursery called
Ocean Approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most recently, I have another
organization working with us called Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nonprofit organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this nursery here produces and can
produce up to 15,000 meters of line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as you'll do the math, you can see
that's a significant amount of production
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to what we're doing in the
Northeast, I have parallel operations
[SPEAKER_02]: right now in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're looking at the Alaskan
coast, it's the biggest coastline in North
[SPEAKER_02]: America for the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an area which really has great
opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are the spools.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's best PVC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our thread, we unspool the spools here on
this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it a long line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's floating in the column.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing is believing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is a production right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this production here is one of
our sites in New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't believe a picture,
you could go to CBS Local News.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did a story on what we were
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were shocked to see a farm in
their own area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you an idea about production
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 meter long line, 1.752 kilos,
that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at production today in Asia,
they're higher than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've been doing this for the last
35 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been dealing with selective
breeding programs to enhance their
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something that we've been able
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, we doubled this in one of our
farms in Long Island Sound, which was what
[SPEAKER_02]: I had expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was really very, very surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put out plants the size of a pinhead in
the month of December.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the month of May, we harvested
plants that were six meters in length.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything was being able to be
regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you an idea about how much is being
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you need these numbers if you're
going to be a farmer in the sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the USDA came over to us and said,
how do we set up a crop insurance program?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, the best way of doing it,
do it the way you do it in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, you're getting unbiased numbers you
can work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, the USDA is looking at setting up
crop insurance programs for farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at nitrogen removal for our
kelp farms there, this is what gets people
[SPEAKER_02]: excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the region, the coastal managers,
we're being able to remove nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would normally stay in the water,
contribute to hypoxia.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here, depending on our spacing,
you can see the productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Productivity is phenomenal in the Bronx,
East River.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all because of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the tissue nitrogen,
the nitrogen removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have N15 data that we've published
showing where the nitrogen is coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: for the kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big surprise for us with the kelp,
kelp was not picking up nitrogen directly
[SPEAKER_02]: from any sewage effluent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was picking it up out of the sediments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something that was very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, another point was working in New
York City and trying to deal with the
[SPEAKER_02]: press gave us an opportunity to leave our
farm in the water above the supposed
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold for survival for kelp blades.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually left the farm in the water
until mid-June.
[SPEAKER_02]: When temperatures were above 22,
23 degrees centigrade, we thought we would
[SPEAKER_02]: have no crop, but we left the lines in for
the news media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we found out something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had production still going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants looked great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have any fouling problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took care of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that opened up the idea of interaction
of temperature tolerance and nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelp don't normally see those nutrients in
the late spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're outcompeted, only what they pick
up in December, January, and February.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to learn something about
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the nutrient bio-extraction
potential right there, that's nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not going to be removed by any
other way biologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: These numbers, working on a year-round
basis, integrate very nicely with
[SPEAKER_02]: shellfish aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they take a different type of nutrient
out that's organically bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're giving coastal managers a
reason why to support our work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can relate that back all to
nongovernmental organizations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to the general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to attack a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we look at nitrogen removal,
site is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Species are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have another benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big issue is ocean acidification,
CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just like Kelp doing their thing,
they're taking out carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've actually looked at that for all
our farm sites in the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have nitrogen removal, carbon
removal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also other issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also looked at heavy metals,
because the alginate and the Kelp is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good chelating substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in the East River side, our Kelp were
deemed edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look at FDA guidelines,
it was well below the threshold of one
[SPEAKER_02]: part per million mercury.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only guideline that the Kelp
food industry has to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we dealt with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also looked at many other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some papers coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This caught the attention to the last
administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last administration gave us a
shout out in their annual report.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they'll happen again in
the new administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we take a look at nutrient
bio-extraction, we're taking out nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen removal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're removing carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting a commodity, a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the reason why you need a private
sector, because who's going to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem service, the private sector does
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a benefit, we have to thank our
entrepreneurs who are involved in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this also adds to the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are open source manuals that we have
actually provided.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have them available, the one on the
left, in English, also in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have videos, because some people don't
like to read videos, our how-to on YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got a more in-depth manual,
the Kelp farming manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I worked on as part of our SBIR phase
two with Ocean Approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvesting, we had to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had to deal with processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done that through a USDA NYFA
grant out of my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a machine that I saw in Asia that
cut squid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, whoa, this could actually cut
seaweed, the Kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we then made this open source.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put any patents on these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanted to get it out, because we
need a critical mass of entrepreneurs that
[SPEAKER_02]: will benefit by some information available
to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are we today?
[SPEAKER_02]: From the beginning to where we are today,
six years, we went from zero farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: zero nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have over 15 farms on the US East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The newest ones coming out in New York in
the paconic bays.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a big nutrient problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a big agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have wine industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're addressing that as we speak
today with our new farms there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got several industrial nurseries
spread out so farmers can get their seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We helped create a non-governmental
organization called Green Wave with our
[SPEAKER_02]: local farmer that we groomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he became the face of our operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Green Wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you Google Brent Smith, you'll see his
TED Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, because he was growing multiple
crops, he calls this 3D farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that went to Buckminster Fuller Award.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just came back from Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a major environmental award there in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schwarzenegger gave him the award,
which was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I like to go, because I know
for North American market, you'll get the
[SPEAKER_02]: highest dollar value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting something in people's mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been working with different
schools in the culinary arts programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited working with community
colleges, because they provide the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: talent to work on the farms with a certain
level of sophistication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's NCC's Noah Community College.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend, Maya Sushi.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're ever in the New Haven area,
the shout out is go to the most unusual
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurant in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the top 10 in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maya Sushi, the bud league there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he works and cocks up many different
interesting recipes with terrestrial
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, especially invasives, as well as
marine plants and also marine animals
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are we now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've created an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got public interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with non-governmental
organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the fun begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I need you, especially the
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to address the collective
breeding, desirable strain development,
[SPEAKER_02]: fast growth, looking at morphology of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what characters are those quantitative
characters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with flavor is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then dealing with the issue of the day
for us, any time you have a crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to deal with disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had a problem, but we have to
be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a change of global environment,
a change in global environment means we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to look at temperature tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do that in the terrestrial sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do that in the aquatic sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to the life cycle right
there, we work with the different stages
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And working with the different stages,
we develop hybridization techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we take our male and female
microscopic stages, we mass culture them
[SPEAKER_02]: in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can do our selective breeding
and producing our sporophytes there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with those gametified stages,
the males and the females, is really that
[SPEAKER_02]: first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the step that the folks in Asia
has done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right over here, you can see the male
filaments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to it, the female filaments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to pick up with micro pipettes,
male filaments, female filaments,
[SPEAKER_02]: and set up germ plasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have breeding lines for many kelp
strains in the entire northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have it pretty in the whole
North Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_02]: East and the west in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Atlantic right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to store our strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in scintillation vials.
[SPEAKER_02]: These look like little fuzzy tufts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had material put in scintillation
vials last for seven years without having
[SPEAKER_02]: their media changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically kept under red light,
which inhibits reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were perfectly happy after seven
years finally getting a dose of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is important, because this is our
seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our germ plasm, our seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also propagate the gametifieds in
13 liter Pyrex bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned hybridization techniques
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have males, we have female plants,
mass culture, the big bottles there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how do you take that and put it
on the lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had to come up with a sprayer
technique, little pressure sprayer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and spray our string on the PVC pipes with
males and females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that takes time, but we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where the art of selective
breeding starts right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see our juvenile plants there
doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some new technology coming out of
Norway that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because after you do your spraying here,
there is a compound that I've been told is
[SPEAKER_02]: proprietary that you can spray on your
material and move your lines directly into
[SPEAKER_02]: the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of keeping you in the laboratory
28 to 35 days in those nursery tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, seeing is believing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is one of our first crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the production here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we did the production estimates of
this crop, we were well over three kilos
[SPEAKER_02]: per meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's equivalent to production in
Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see some of my babies right
over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all excited seeing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at some quantitative traits,
one trait that is very, very obvious,
[SPEAKER_02]: you find saccharina plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some with a short stipe, some with a long
stipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the stability of looking at
these stipe characteristics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which plants can be involved in
inheritance of stipe length?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done our crosses, set up our
little diagrams here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we discovered with our plants
there when we did our crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a female plant that controls the
length of the stipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Females control the length of the stipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exciting because we can breed
out the stipe if we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say if you're working in the offshore
environment of the North Atlantic where we
[SPEAKER_02]: plan to have major farm operations there,
we can get rid of the hazard, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: stipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in shallow coastal waters,
this would be very good because it offers
[SPEAKER_02]: another product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is a product from the stipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cut them up, look like instead of
black olives, you have little green
[SPEAKER_02]: structures there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes a great smoothie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutritious for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't talked about all the nutritional
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, anti-tumor compounds are found in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the populations that eat kelp in Asia
there have a unique microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's wide open when it comes to
what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at our wild sauce seeding,
working with donor populations,
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery technology, seeding time,
offspring morphology there, working
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start developing predictable
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start doing things flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could potentially start looking at
extending the growing season, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what could we learn from Asia?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always worried about Asia taking
information from here, which is usually
[SPEAKER_02]: there on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look at two kelp, I spent a lot
of time in Korea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've trained many Korean students there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two kelp species, one on dairy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is saccharina slash
laminaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see strain selection started in
the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is, 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have that other than what's going
on in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at male and female cloned culture,
selective breeding is what they've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is on dairy, this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant could be up to five to eight
meters during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at strain selection for the
saccharina, this is the Asian strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some of the work that they've
done right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this goes so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Selective breeding, the wild type,
here is a plant that's gone through
[SPEAKER_02]: selective breeding of Andaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tells it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years, you've been able to double the
size of the plant, increase some other
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting attributes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this turns out to be very important,
as you will see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is saccharina.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my former grad student,
Jong Kim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a plant that they have in the
culture collection, a press plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant produced during the one
growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's five and a half months of growth,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the collection there at the
National Culture Collection in Korea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at that selective breeding
there, what's driving it right now in
[SPEAKER_02]: Korea, there's always so much can go to
food for humans, but growing abalone,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a very good delicacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in abalone, they run into a problem
growing these mollusks.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Asia, the problem is they love kelp,
but they can't get it in the summer
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to expand the temperature
tolerance some way or form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is a good opportunity to
do that, because once you expand it
[SPEAKER_02]: further into the growing season,
that adds stability to this other
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, which is very important there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to put this in here,
because when they did the selective
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, they were up against a block.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't get any higher temperature
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they started doing interspecific
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done in Asia now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it in Korea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've also been doing it in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is interspecific to undaria plants
that didn't have any blockages right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their hybrid was reproductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this here led to a strain that has two
extra months of growing season to help the
[SPEAKER_02]: abalone and extend the profitability for
the undaria material in Korea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at that, what does the
hybrid look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it gives you more production.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you interesting characters that
are expressed as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has all been determined.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're at this particular point in
North America where the Asians were a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building upon all that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is really important, because we
can see from the schemes of setting up a
[SPEAKER_02]: farming system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can insert yourselves right over
here into the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with domestication processes here,
working with genomics and applied genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: right over here is what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to put this in,
because in China, which is the leader for
[SPEAKER_02]: the world, they produced this Japanese
kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it plateaued in size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was the biggest kelp,
fastest producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a unique name, had very interesting
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But temperature tolerance was an issue
with this kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something else came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew the Chinese were trying this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to grow the sugar kelp in
their coastal waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one reason or another, it didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the last four years now,
they went back to their culture collection
[SPEAKER_02]: to sugar kelp strains that came from Long
Island Sound, not from my lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: but one of my colleagues who spent his
sabbatical year with me in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they created a new strain,
high-yielding strain, the alawan strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this strain was high-yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is important right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've gone through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done this with interspecies
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work with a male saccharina latissima
plant from North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they cross it with their female
saccharina japonica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in production in China right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I wanted to show you these are
farms in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we may have something
going in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have coastal farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are right now a new program that
the RPE has FOA out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we submitted a pre-proposal,
along with a couple of colleagues here
[SPEAKER_02]: from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ultimately, we want to be able to
work in the federal waters of the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, the EZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: From 12 miles out, up two hours a limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: 212 miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can do that and grow kelp in those
areas, we have a biofuel product for the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a decade away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, the $25 million for
this program called MARINA gives us the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to develop the tools that we
need, especially in genetics, that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: useful in a decade from now when we start
paying more for our fuels.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, the Department of
Energy's RPE program has that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after listening last night to the
new EPA administrator, for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: the story is look at contemporary issues
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice what happens in a global climatic
change situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Higher water temperatures is going to
impact negatively the kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to work on working on that
trade, understanding that trade,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way the Koreans have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the Chinese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we look at that, we have to
understand, how do we extend that growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season?
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all part and parcel of the
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're doing that, this gives an
opportunity for breeders like yourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: to be involved in the short term and in
the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecosystem services is the driver to get
people interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets NGOs excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, as I tell people, who's going to
do your ecosystem services?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring in the entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them the opportunity where they can
take place, develop their business there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get these other benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't talked about habitat
enhancement, diversity there, but I can
[SPEAKER_02]: just say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anecdotal, around many of our 15,
16 farms in the East Coast, every winter
[SPEAKER_02]: we have seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many seals around the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those seals are doing one thing,
eating during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: An adult seal eats 35 to 40 pounds of fish
per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have 20 seals in a farm area,
they're eating fish, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulating because of the transient
habitat that we put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Applications is what's going to drive it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This all funnels back to our basic science
that we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up in coastal management?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just excited about having a
successful crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with shellfish as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm focusing on our kelp because
that's the most exciting right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with many different environmental
organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper for us to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we get their support.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very interested in education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bringing in undergraduates,
even high school students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our work has had a lot of good
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support from the Sea Grant Program,
which is being X'd out by the new
[SPEAKER_02]: administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so WNPR is going to have a little plug
on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was interviewed yesterday on the way up
here from the WNPR about Sea Grant
[SPEAKER_02]: Programs for the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very important back in the 1980s
when nobody was paying attention to what I
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, as we develop
the entrepreneurs there through the SBIR
[SPEAKER_02]: programs there, we've gained a lot of
interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have joint programs that NOAA has
sponsored between Korea and China.
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped set those up back in the last
century.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been very successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Information transfer all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We build upon what they've done there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is all in part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're creating a new industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you said that you're working the
East River.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys obviously didn't run into any
issues with heavy metal pickup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know or see if there's a variation
for uptake?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Site is the biggest driver for what we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the sites are interesting
because we go back to legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legacy in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also go back what goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut is a state that's built on
bedrock.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bedrock is rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: In one particular compound element,
I should say, arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had to measure arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it in different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're below any threshold for water,
at least, in the seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at it in organic and organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've looked at mercury, cadmium,
lead, chromium, zinc, and copper.
[SPEAKER_02]: They met all the guidelines for food in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: They met the Canadian fisheries standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: They met the EU standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the top of the standards on the globe
are from France.
[SPEAKER_02]: The French standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did that to protect their
industry there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we met there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to do that for every site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would I want to grow the cow to do that
for Harvard?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have a very rich legacy at
BCBs there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get away with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my remediations is in the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides just remediating for a lot of
these, do you actually see a reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: the algal weight?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know something?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are looking at that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so much in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every drop you take out, you're going to
remove some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the phytoplankton.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't looked at the reduction in the
blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do tell you, we can take out,
you have hundreds of tons of
phytoplankton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biomass, that has that level of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't do it, it was going to be
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may go into the sediment and continue
to be part of the legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at that in Long Island
Sound, especially out of Long Island now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the carbon issue is a very
significant issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much so, I have friends at Puget Sound,
in a restoration they got a grant from
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Allen Foundation for carbon
remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It entered around kelp bombs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question is, what is the size
of a kelp bomb that you can detect with an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in pH for dealing with ocean
acidification?
[SPEAKER_01]: All good research questions, good
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: What temperature range are you putting in?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at temperature tolerance
right now in the low 20s of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature tolerance of the gametophyte
is different from the sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we have to pump out both the half
points and ultimately the dip points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the dip points is production
phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was thinking about is, you know,
if we have a big nitrate problem in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, in the Gulf, and we throw kelp
right of course into our R&A, we get to 55
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem for low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: High temperature is a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the West Coast, Macrosystis is the
giant kelp out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with health and
colleagues at Scripps, laying some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: information out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are opportunities for
nutrient bio-extraction on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just helping a small startup company
out in the San Francisco area,
[SPEAKER_02]: spun along from Berkeley and also UCSB.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they're trying to get the
coastal commission excited about giving
[SPEAKER_02]: them the permits for the issuer of palms
to remediate the nitrogen issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another tool in the toolbox that
we've now given.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said before, you're looking at
work that was spotted seriously at that
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem scale eight or nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think the potential maximum
capacity will be for this industry in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Northeast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a question that, looking at today's
markets there, according to someone,
[SPEAKER_02]: my Korean colleagues who have had their
country's agriculture technology
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment, they felt that the North
American market can easily notice several
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred million dollars for products like
food, whole foods, high-end.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to see products grown in U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: coastal waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to deal with sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got that market right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now, we don't have any limits
on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it holding material.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have palm systems that are looking
at the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a whole different way looking at
food ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people have to eat, we want to put
this into the food stream, as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: other products, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to meet that demand, how many farms or
how many hectares of coastal water land?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, we have the National Ocean Center of
NOAA, determining that question right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing that through GIS because
we have to be able to separate the issuers
[SPEAKER_02]: offshore and offshore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that for Long Island Sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how many hectares we can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some estimates of economic
development for Long Island Sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a bill in the Canadian
legislation that goes for a vote on Monday
[SPEAKER_02]: to promote sea weed aquaculture because at
least the business people feel that easily
[SPEAKER_02]: the Long Island Sound area can be able to
create about 55 to 75 billion dollars of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that will go right into the local
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And local markets is where it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to deal with your
transportation costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The offshore work, that's a new area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the exciting area because then
we're going to be able to rival what you
[SPEAKER_02]: folks have been doing in wheat,
you know, barley, corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be another player out
there for a food product way to support it
[SPEAKER_02]: in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They realize that here we're dealing with
material that doesn't need water and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and what's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how is this nitrogen credit or carbon
credit worth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it actually turn into money for a
private company or is it just a way of...
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 17 pounds right now in the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are private companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are raising their own capital,
which is absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect the government to do that for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to take a certain amount of the
risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: These entrepreneurs, the farmers,
they're taking risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: For them, many of them are shellfish
growers where they are not using their
[SPEAKER_02]: people and their boats during the winter
months and they're sitting idly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oil is important as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So private capital is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why the president's
administration let the FOA for the RBE
[SPEAKER_01]: continue since they were in demand for
biofuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they heard some of the economic
development pieces for the private sector
[SPEAKER_02]: was deeply involved in getting the
research to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's going to drive plant
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We aren't dealing with marine plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a little bit more aging avoidance
than what you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, those principles are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
