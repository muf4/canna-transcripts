[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for inviting me to talk today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just give you a little bit of
background history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So branching out is the IPM newsletter for
trees and shrubs and it covers insects and
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases of woody plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we publish every two weeks from April
through June and every three weeks from
[SPEAKER_01]: July through September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to provide timely information on
all aspects of pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newsletter itself was started by Dr.
George Hudler in the plant pathology
[SPEAKER_01]: department at Cornell in 1994 as a
master's project for one of his graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: students.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came on board in July of 1996 and for
those of you who can do math, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is 20 years of writing branching out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may have heard that George has
retired in January of this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he is still working with me on the
branching out newsletter as the co-editor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says he will continue to do that
for as long as I'd like to continue to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our target audience for the newsletter
is tree care professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So arborists and golf course
superintendents and urban foresters and
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goal is to inform these pest
managers on the progress of insect and my
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases on woody ornamentals in the New
York State area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to a lesser degree, we cover
incurrences of symptoms of non-infectious
[SPEAKER_01]: plant problems too, such as freezing
injury and winter drying and drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we do it was we gather all this
information by a combination of on-site
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting and reports from other
contributors to help us prepare the
[SPEAKER_01]: articles about the pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gather all the observations and we
prepare them into a commentary about the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsequent life stages of the pest and
then scouting tips that might be helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: and preventative or curative actions and
management alternatives as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is I drive down a mix of
different places that I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I drive downstate to Long Island and I
visit various sites and county extension
[SPEAKER_01]: offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I return back to Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: But along the route, I make predetermined
stops at Orange, Westchester, and Nassau
[SPEAKER_01]: counties on each of our trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of our stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stop at Farmingdale College in Nassau
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also stop at Hofstra University.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Planting Fields Arboretum as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not too terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planting Fields, you may recognize,
that's a very famous site that's often
[SPEAKER_01]: taken photos of at Planting Fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the other sites we stop at
was I go to a cemetery in Westchester
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scouting in the cemetery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cemeteries are very barren,
but this particular one has a nice mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: trees and shrubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily they don't treat anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another day of the week, I go to the
western part of New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to Finger Lakes Community College,
which has a nice little arboretum there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in Wayne County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also go to Highland Park in
Monroe County.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I revisit these specific sites in
the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same sites all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have an idea of what I'm looking for
each spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I get surprises all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep an eye out for things that
aren't looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything a little off color,
a little browning or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I'm looking and I'm seeing a
lot of maybe ants or flies or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, there's a lot of
honeydew over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening with that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So by revisiting these specific sites and
doing that on site scouting, I can keep a
[SPEAKER_01]: good, you know, monitoring those pest
populations on a regular basis and can
[SPEAKER_01]: keep a good eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we then I also have several sites
in the Ithaca area that I scout on,
[SPEAKER_01]: including my own property, which is an
abandoned Christmas tree farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when my husband and I bought that
property eight years ago, George asked me
[SPEAKER_01]: if we had paid extra because of all the
great diseases I told them that we have on
[SPEAKER_01]: our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was thrilled to hear that we had a
nice infection of pine pine gall rust and
[SPEAKER_01]: white pine blister rust and a variety of
other nice conifer diseases and insects as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much we could do a scouting trip
right to my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to my own on site scouting,
I also have Cornell Cooperative Extension
[SPEAKER_01]: agent that and some arborists that help
contribute observations for the scouting
[SPEAKER_01]: report section as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps kind of give a nice little
snapshot of pest populations in the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: state at any given time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's how it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the newsletter itself, in each issue,
we, in addition to the scouting report,
[SPEAKER_01]: we include a feature article, and that
gives us an opportunity to address a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular pest or other topic in more
detail than we can in the other columns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the last several years, we've been
able to upgrade and include color photos
[SPEAKER_01]: and the scouting reports as well as the
feature article, thanks to some generous
[SPEAKER_01]: donations from arborists and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also include growing degree days
and phenology in each issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to keep the text pretty easy to
read and just the right length to cover
[SPEAKER_01]: each topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the tree care professionals out
there are really busy, and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for a quick snapshot, they need to
know what do they need to look for this
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't they don't have a lot
of time to, you know, read a ton of text.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to boil it down to just the
essentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can just look at that or share
with their staff and go right out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and use that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see, one of the things this
season we hope to do is something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: George would like to make some videos,
which then we would link from a QR code
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would include in the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you know George, you know
that he's quite the entertainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say that we take those
centerfolds, so whatever you call them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we post them in our diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when volunteers have, you know,
a little bit of time, they can peruse
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, and it's very helpful
because I think that what comes in often
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects that that that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's what we're kind of hoping
is a reflection of what's going on out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and we go downstate to scout
because really, they're often a week or
[SPEAKER_01]: more ahead of the rest of New York State,
especially up here in central New York or
[SPEAKER_01]: a little farther north.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know it's worth our time to go down
there and to get that scouting information
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're a bit ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often what we'll see last week in Long
Island is just happening this week and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, parts farther north than New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so here's just a quick look at our
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty simple, basic, but it's got
information about subscription
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also look at back issues if you're
not familiar with the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got back issues here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Idea of what the newsletter includes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that branching out self-supporting
through subscription charges and donations
[SPEAKER_01]: and the normal charge for the subscription
is $50.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Cornell Cooperative Extension
educators, you can get the electronic
[SPEAKER_01]: access to branching out for no charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to send me an email and
you can do that through contact us is my
[SPEAKER_01]: email.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is on there and send us
an email and I would email you the
[SPEAKER_01]: password information you need for the 2016
season and it changes every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know, if you're willing to help
spread the word about branching out,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can provide you with subscription forms
so you can have available at your county
[SPEAKER_01]: offices to share with to bring to the
attention of true care professionals in
[SPEAKER_01]: your county.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we have about 400
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including some big names like the
Smithsonian and Longwood Gardens and Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: Smith's College.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the majority of our readers are from
New York State or the New England states,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have a handful from other states,
including Ohio and Michigan and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the newsletter,
we also published a book, so it's 150
[SPEAKER_01]: updated feature articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 300 page book and that is $35,
which is to kind of finish up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that we were really
noticing this season that seems some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the highlights are winter injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a lot of desiccation on
spruce and true firs this spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we had a nice article in the last issue
and issue number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandra Jensen from the Diagnostic Lab
wrote a nice article all about the
[SPEAKER_01]: desiccation on conifers and so that we are
getting a bunch of questions on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now what we're seeing out in the
field is this is a time season for
[SPEAKER_01]: different rust to be sporulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of cedar rust are out
there and they're full glory and white
[SPEAKER_01]: pine blister rust is kind of just
finishing up, but we've got pine pine gall
[SPEAKER_01]: rust coming and from Don Gable down in the
botanic garden in New York said that he
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks it's going to be a banner year for
cedar rust from what he was seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other interesting tidbit was
we got a report from the Long Island that
[SPEAKER_01]: boxwood leaf miner was emerging rather
early this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a couple weeks earlier than
we expected, but it came from a very
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable source and he even saw the pupil
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're sure that he knows what he's
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a conversation with Dan Guillory
and we were both surprised that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out a little early, but we've
always included that in this week's
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the sort of stuff that we like
to put in things that are maybe slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do welcome anything that's
happening in your county.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to hear any information,
especially if you've got outbreak
[SPEAKER_01]: situation of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to share that with our readers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they know what's going on in the state
and it's nice for us because we can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I scout in many places,
it's really just a snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't go to all the sites in New
York state, but so anything that if you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to share with us, we'd be willing to
take any information that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you've all seen the problems
with blue spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one answer, unfortunately,
on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we're kind of keeping an eye on
seeing what's happening with the blue
[SPEAKER_01]: spruce this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been kind of a problem for the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know many of you have seen that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing down in the lower Hudson
Valley a lot more, is it spruce budgall
[SPEAKER_00]: midge?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we've been seeing it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't know what we were looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were finding all kinds of other things
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, you're saying, oh,
it's got this and it's got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're looking for it,
we're finding it in a lot of spruce
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, Norway spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put a little bit of information
about that in the newsletter for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan Gilberne's been very helpful with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
