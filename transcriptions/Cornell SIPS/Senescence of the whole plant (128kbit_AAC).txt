[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to tell you a story of
investigations over many years and with
[SPEAKER_01]: many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, why do annual plants
die at the end of the growing season,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though the weather might be perfectly
good?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is puzzle botanists for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the first person to publish about
this was Hans Mollisch, who was a
[SPEAKER_01]: professor in Prague and Vienna.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he published a book on the longevity
of plants with a lot of data in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he concluded that as the lifespan of
an annual plant can be prolonged by
[SPEAKER_01]: preventing flowering and fruiting,
he suggests that nutrient exhaustion might
[SPEAKER_01]: be the cause, that the plant is running
out of nutrients because it's all going to
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was another idea around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this derived from experiments by Carl
Leopold, who some of you may remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spent a good many years of his career
here at Cornell, the Boyce Thompson
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some research he did quite a long time
ago, he pointed out that if you deflower
[SPEAKER_01]: male spinach plants here, you would
prevent senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the flowers of male spinach plants
are so small, they can't possibly be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking nutrients from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, this led to the idea of a
senescence factor, a death hormone,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you like, coming out of the flowers or
fruits and causing the death of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the chief proponents of this
over the years has been a professor at
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, Larry Nuden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's now retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at many conferences, he gave data
which he claimed supported this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in my opinion, he never produced
any concrete evidence for such a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never identified it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was always this nebulous
senescence factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started thinking about this problem
many years ago and couldn't think how to
[SPEAKER_01]: tackle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I read an article put out by the
college in one of their newsletters by
[SPEAKER_01]: Cowles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an article by Jerry Marks at
Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jerry Marks was a professor in
horticultural sciences at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a pea geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he reported in this internal article
in Cowles' New York agriculture or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that he had a genetic line of
peas which senesced in the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but did not senesce if he grew it in the
winter in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he named this line of peas Geneva II
or G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Jerry at his height up at
Geneva working with the peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Jerry died what is now many
years ago of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he is no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was probably one of the two prime
pea geneticists in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, here's the peas he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are G2 peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these peas, senescence is regulated
by day length.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have a pea growing in long days,
it produces flowers and fruits and dyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grow it in short days,
it produces flowers and fruits,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now have a way to investigate
senescence by photoperiod and genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: because all other peas die regardless of
day length.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a genetic control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we did is have a look
at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that, indeed, Jerry didn't
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just knew summer and winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we go back to the original
experiments of Garner and Allard on
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, we realized that it's likely to
be photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the number of hours of light per
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the number of reproductive nodes
before it dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you see, if you have 13 hours or
less of light, it essentially keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: growing ad infinitum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you lengthen the day length,
the plant produces fewer and fewer nodes
[SPEAKER_01]: before senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this bottoms out at about 10 nodes if
you give it 18 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a photoperiodic response.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found out you couldn't change a short
day to a long day just by a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't matter if a grad student
opened the growth chamber in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day and shut it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was measuring the total amount of
light, total photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the high intensity reaction
type of a phytochrome response.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Australian colleagues identified it
from light color experiments as a
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochrome response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in these peas, you first see
senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a G2 grown in short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see up in the greenhouse up at
Gooderman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the vigor of that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by contrast, this is the G2 in long
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, the bud has become
extremely small and stops growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first sign you're going to
get that the whole plant is then going to
[SPEAKER_01]: die as the fruits mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the short day bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the long day bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just becomes extremely small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this initial cessation of the growth
at the apex has been termed apical arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apical arrest occurs first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you will have the senescence of the
apex and then the senescence of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this, I started working closely
with colleagues in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Ian Murphy, who came to
Cornell on a couple of sabbaticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to know him well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he identified the fact that two genes
had to be present in the dominant form to
[SPEAKER_01]: get this property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he named these SN and HR for sterile
nodes and high response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the G2 is dominant SN dominant HR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jerry Marks had all combinations of
these where he could get a recessive
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant, dominant recessive, and
recessive recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most peas in cultivation are double
recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing we need to note is that
if you remove the fruits from these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, they will not senesce even in long
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a short day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, it's continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a long day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth has ceased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is one where all the fruits have
been removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is grown in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it keeps growing regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have any fruits, it'll keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were removing the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll show you some more data relevant
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, is it the total
nutrients that go into the fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did this just by jumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are the growth rates of all of the
fruits in long and short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we cut them off before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I should say it's really when they
start developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it gets more and more intense with
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the growth rates of the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the minimum number to induce
senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the maximum filling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we look at short days, where you
have the maximum number of fruits,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are growing at a rate that exceeds
the minimum growth rate to induce
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the total amount of nutrients going
into the fruits does not correlate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not simply nutrients going into
the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if fruit load is not a factor,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, indeed, is a plant with
something like 30 pods on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, it's showing no sign of
senescence because it's growing in long
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the total amount of fruits appears to
be irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, we thought, well,
we're going to investigate a senescence
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a senescence factor that comes out
of the fruit, we must be able to trace it
[SPEAKER_01]: from the fruit to the apical bud,
because that's where you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did, we enclosed the fruit in a
gas-tight container, initially glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, it was plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put in carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you look at partitioning,
you would expect photosynthate to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves to the fruit, from the leaves
to the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there was some coming out of the
fruit to the apical bud, it was probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, if we label it with CO2 and we
get it labeled with carbon, we're much
[SPEAKER_01]: more likely to see it than if we just look
for something that's not labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the data from such an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit here was labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's being cut off because it was so
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's where the radioactivity went.
[SPEAKER_01]: It primarily went to the same side as the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the leaves as we go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So radioactivity comes out of that fruit
and goes to the other fruits, primarily on
[SPEAKER_01]: the same side, because of the vascular
connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we get them all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the amount in the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indeed, some will go from the treated
fruit to the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, a senescence factor is a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then looked at the data comparing
long days and short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The labeled fruit is 50% elongated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fully elongated, 30% to 50% filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the amount exported from the
fruit as compared to the total amount
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very small amount comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is short days and long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the amount that goes to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the amount that ends up in the
apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to cut a long story short, there is
much more going to the apical bud in short
[SPEAKER_01]: days than in long days on the order of
that fully elongated about 10 times as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the figures don't match what you would
expect if a senescence factor was coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more transport of carbon in short
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what happens to this export.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are doing here, we're allowing the
fruits labeled fruits and we're allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: them to photosynthesize in radioactive CO2
for 15 minutes and then doing a chase as
[SPEAKER_01]: to where the radioactivity finishes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, a small amount
finishes up in the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge amount is actually found in the
leaves surrounding the labeled pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shoots up and then we've stopped the
radioactivity at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the radioactivity leaves the
leaves and turns up in the other pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does this occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turned out that the movement of
the radio label material out of the pods
[SPEAKER_01]: is happening in the xylem and not the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening is the photosynthate
comes in in solution in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of water comes out coming in
exceeds the transpiration by the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the water leaves by the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that with simple experiments
killing the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you kill the phloem, it makes
absolutely no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that the water is leaving
is the difference in water potential
[SPEAKER_01]: between the fruits and the surrounding
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the day, here's long days,
this is negative bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want negative megapascals divide by
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the water potential of the fruits
in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the water potential of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the day, the leaves lose water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their water potential drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a movement of water from the
fruits to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this occurs also in apples and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of water going into a fruit
in the phloem exceeds the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the same in apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the change in size between the
beginning of the day and the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day or the midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: An apple shrinks because the water is
going out to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then identified the radioactivity
that was coming out of the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We tracked it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 73% is sucrose, which is probably not
surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of what came in left.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also 16% by GC mass spec was
malic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: How come we get malic acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out that the pods of peas
also have C4 photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the leaves, but the pods do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some malic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I can see Klaus with a big
frown on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's from the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't go and investigate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got 89%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no other major compound could be
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are unlikely, in my opinion,
senescence factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't correspond with it in logic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long days either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my conclusion is fruit-derived
senescence factors do not exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've already told you fruit load is not
the factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told you a senescence factor doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you left with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out that it requires a bit
of observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, look at this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still not senescing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've been staring at this for
years, it turns out, without sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing basic plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to just look at the plant and see
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is that the rate of
development of the flowers and fruits is
[SPEAKER_01]: much more rapid in long days than short
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the tip of G2Ps grown in short
days and long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you just to look at the
difference here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a flower bud up in the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even down here, you're not really
getting much of a development of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: By contrast, look at the long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the flower bud there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge flower bud there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower bud, flower bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower buds are growing much more
rapidly in long days than short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fruits, you see a fruit there,
fruit there, fruit there, already
[SPEAKER_01]: elongating while there's no sign of
anything happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a speed of development factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I should point out that this work
is carried out by many students over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you their names at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the results of one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What she was doing is looking at the
percent of assimilates from the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: transported to the apical bud,
comparing two different lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: one that is double recessive and then the
G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount going to the apical bud is
virtually the same in long and short days
[SPEAKER_01]: in the double recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount is fairly low.
[SPEAKER_01]: By contrast, in G2, the amount going to
the vegetative tissue in short days in the
[SPEAKER_01]: apical bud is much greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the leaf that was
treated, different leaves treated at
[SPEAKER_01]: different distances from the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the apical bud, the vegetative
tissues, are receiving much more
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthate than is the case in long
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now have a difference in the amount
of material going to the apical bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we look at comparing the
flower buds and the vegetative tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: within the apical bud, and student Maureen
Kelly did the dissections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is expressing the radioactivity in
the flower buds and the radioactivity in
[SPEAKER_01]: the young leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this is high, it indicates that
there's a shift to reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are, G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the ratio in short days when
there's no senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the ratio in long days when there's
senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a shift from the vegetative to
the reproductive tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is one of the, this is I2,
is dominant SN recessive HR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more shift of resources to the
reproduction in long days when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing we do in my lab is
investigate hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found early on, gibberellin
applications could prevent senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an early bioassay showed that there
was more bioactive gibberellin in G2Ps in
[SPEAKER_01]: short days and much less in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was before the pathway of
gibberellin biosynthesis had been fully
[SPEAKER_01]: worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then got to work on identifying
these gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I did, I took one of
the precursors of gibberellin,
[SPEAKER_01]: namely gibberellin A12 aldehyde,
and fed it to pea shoots and asked what it
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are HPLC traces, short days
here, long days here, half an hour at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of treatment and six hours at the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is time evolution of an HPLC column.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most polar compounds come off
first and the least polar compounds come
[SPEAKER_01]: off later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The treating material GA12 aldehyde,
which we had to make, by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we made it, we fed mevalonic
acid to pumpkin, developing pumpkin seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to get some pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, Ray Sheldrake,
some of you in horticulture, may remember
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray Sheldrake, had a farm, early bird farm
south of Ithaca, and was growing pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I contacted Ray and said, can I have a
pumpkin?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we shot down to his field to get the
pumpkin just at the right size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one really nice pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we cut it and we brought it back to the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ray then let it be known that that was
his prize pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a video camera running on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Following the growth of the pumpkin,
suddenly one day his pumpkin was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next year, I actually purchased a
certain number of plants from Ray.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew them because my success up at
Gooderman was pretty pathetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually had a paid source of
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to treat the seeds at a very
particular time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we didn't treat the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to get an enzyme extract,
feed it mevalonic acid, and it made
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberellin A12 aldehyde in tiny percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just summarized four years of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like you now to take a look at
the difference between long days and short
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at half an hour,
you will see there's this peak here,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: In long days, much higher in short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this turns out to be gibberellin
number 53, which is one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberellins made from GA12 aldehyde.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we compare again six hours,
you'll see these are much greater in
[SPEAKER_01]: amount here in short days than here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are further gibberellins in the
pathway, namely 44, 19, and 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: which probably is gobbledygook to most of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll explain where they fit in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the amount of radioactivity in GA53
at one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the amount of radioactivity in
44, 19, and 20 at six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in short days in G2, the amount is
greater than in long days in G2,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is down the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost twice the amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these plants, where they're not
senescing, are making more active
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the gibberellin biosynthesis
pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is GA12 aldehyde.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the succession of
gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's my patron saint, Mendel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was part of a group in the late 1990s
that identified this gene here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we got it out and we sequenced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the gene that controls
Mendel's tallness factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tall plants make GA1, and dwarf plants
make only 1 20th of the amount because of
[SPEAKER_01]: this gene here, which we show to be
gibberellin 3-beta hydroxylase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, in my senescence ones,
this is the step, the crucial step that
[SPEAKER_01]: appears to be regulated by photoperiod in
G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you up this, you have the potential
for making more gibberellin number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is the bioactive gibberellin in
peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am working on this in the
Gooderman greenhouse with Yuxuan Zhu,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was one of the first Chinese to come
to Cornell in 1936.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the plant sciences, and he's now a full
professor at Peking University in China
[SPEAKER_01]: and a member of the Chinese National
Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his task was to analyze the
gibberellins in these peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is GA20 content of the vegetative
tissue of G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will see that there is a lot more
in the vegetative tissue in short days
[SPEAKER_01]: than there is in long days in G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he measured GA1, the bioactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, GA20 is one before GA1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the amount of GA1 in the
vegetative tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the amount of GA1 in the
vegetative tissue is much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is happening is that the
gibberellin enhances the growth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative tissues in the apical bud,
causing them to have a higher sync
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is my conclusion for the
mechanisms or the mechanism of whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the diversion of nutrients from the
vegetative tissue to the reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue very early in reproductive
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not simply the seeds that it occurs
very early in reproductive development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get the shift to the
reproductive tissues, this leads to the
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence of the vegetative tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is under genetic control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the evidence for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the G2P senesce only in long days
and continues in short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers and fruits develop more
rapidly in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nutrient partitioning from the leaves
is more in favor of developing flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: fruits in long days and in vegetative
tissue in short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this effect is seen very early on
because I showed you the pictures of the
[SPEAKER_01]: developing flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to wait till the fruit have
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seen very early in reproductive
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a physiological shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the apical bud, there's a 10 to
20-fold long-day induced shift in
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthes from the developing,
from the apical bud to the developing
[SPEAKER_01]: floral buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the floral buds, not the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, genotypes which suggest,
sorry, which senesce regardless of photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period, display a partitioning similar to
G2 in long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't show you much of the data on
that, but that was another whole set of
[SPEAKER_01]: the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think is causing
senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do think that I do not think
it's actually photosynthate because when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting senescence of the plant,
there's plenty of available starch in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not photosynthate per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this does bring us back to the
original experiments by Carl Leopold where
[SPEAKER_01]: he was getting male spinach plants to
senesce and they have no fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No seeds because they're males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male and spinach is dioecious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male and female plants are separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening there?
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't fit this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another student investigated spinach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, if we look at the
architecture, we see the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you don't see that in Leopold's
photograph, if you look here, look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of, these are male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the female flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go on to produce the fruit,
but they are very tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at the difference in amount of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has very little leaf growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has much more leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at the difference in
leaves, there you can see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male on this, the left, female on the
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens if you allow these plants
to photosynthesize in radioactive CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants were treated, a leaf was
below the inflorescence, was treated with
[SPEAKER_01]: radioactive CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we asked where the photosynthesate
went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, the top line in all these other
graphs is the percent of total export.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is dividing by the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get, if you like, sink strength
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the black is male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gray is female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the various tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will notice that the male flowers
are in fact taking up a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just all the photosynthesate
going to flowers and fruits and the
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male flowers are nutrient hogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the males in the audience
probably like their lunch as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the amount of radioactive CO2
activity from a leaf going to the flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: and fruits over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the number of weeks from the
start of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black are the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gray are the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at the amount going to the male
here versus the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males are in fact nutrient hogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they not continue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at this point, the plants die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a short, fast life for the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The females have a much more prolonged
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on when the fruits are
developing, they do take up more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that the males don't take up
any nutrients is just not, or
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesate is just not correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll skip that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this again fits the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it is the diversion of nutrients to
the flowers very early in development that
[SPEAKER_01]: starts triggering the senescence process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to add a couple of
slides from Xu Sheng.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was good enough to give them to me for
this summary talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you stop the growth of the apical bud
to get senescence, the lateral buds must
[SPEAKER_01]: also stop growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you won't get senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a wild type Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one that enables the
production of continued cytokinin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have cytokinin in the lateral
buds, they keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one does not senesce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just one process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a whole lot of processes going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whole plant senescence consists of
three coordinated biological processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the cessation of the growth of
the apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have the plant continuing to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the senescence of the somatic
organs, such as the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need the suppression of the axon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Axillary buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the whole process is,
of course, controlled by genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another one of Xu Sheng's
plants where he is using RNAi to knock
[SPEAKER_01]: down a gene associated with senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole thing is under genetic
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is being remobilized from the
vegetative tissue to the reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the evidence is that one of the most
important factors is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I have not done any work on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of papers are now coming out on
the remobilization of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest that this shift very
early in reproductive development is a
[SPEAKER_01]: shift in the nitrogen partitioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as the leaves senesce,
nitrogen is released.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this nitrogen now goes up to either
the reproductive tissue or, if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get senescence, to the vegetative
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a couple of diagrams here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's all sorts of schemes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's where they came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the basic idea is now you have the
leaves, the nitrogen reserves in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to get continued
growth, these will go up to the new
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after this shift has occurred,
these nitrogen reserves go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive tissue, leaving the
vegetative tissue deficient in nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably other compounds so that they
do not continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a summary slide of what would
happen during monocarpic senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start off with vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the initiation of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is a start of a shift to
the flowers at the expense of vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And papers are now coming out that's
suggesting that microRNAs are regulating
[SPEAKER_01]: this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not anything I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what recent papers suggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this leads to a resource
redistribution and the triggering of a
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of this is hormonal changes in
the different tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you then get a distribution from the
vegetative to reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this leads to apical senescence and
cell death of the vegetative tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a withdrawal of nitrogen
compounds from the leaves associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to have the inhibition
of axillary bud growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final result is the overall
senescence of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked on peas because a lot of this
was done before Arabidopsis became
[SPEAKER_01]: popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Xu Sheng in the front row works on
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd like to point out that we need
some other models.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to introduce you to the Shus
Yucca.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shus Yucca is a yucca in the
southwestern desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 1952, Gustav Albrecht provided
startling photographic proof in the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific monthly that this plant had a
remarkable ability to grow extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly and senesce all within a matter of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is the photographs presented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he claimed that he was taking these at
minute intervals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's senescing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to suggest this is an extremely
good model for a future examination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the problems with peas,
you're waiting for three months and even
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis, you're waiting for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would be really a good way of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after that, I would like to acknowledge
the many students over the years who have
[SPEAKER_01]: worked on this and where they have ended
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the many collaborators who joined
me in this work on the right side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, that's where I'm going to
quit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thank you very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to end show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got, hopefully, one other little
thing for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the pioneers in this field was
Karl Leopold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Karl Leopold, he moved mainly into
other topics when he was at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was a delightful colleague.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we often went to senescence
conferences together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And together with Brian Shabbat,
I see at the back, who also worked on
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence of strawberry mainly,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Senescence of strawberry plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karl Leopold was a great guitar player.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at various faculty gatherings,
he would play his guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or also at conferences, he would always,
after the banquet, he would get out his
[SPEAKER_01]: guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he liked to play the songs of Tom
Lehrer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would play I'm a Gnu.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also played this song called
Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've discovered that current graduate
students don't know these delightful
[SPEAKER_01]: songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to finish off by playing for
you Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lobachevsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I put that in this to the memory of
Karl Leopold.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Peter, I have one.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, thank you for a delightful
seminar.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And memorable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Given the work that you and others did on
this G2 phone, has there been research
[SPEAKER_07]: done that has either proved or disproved
that there are certain species that are
[SPEAKER_07]: obligate annuals that cannot be
manipulated to not senesce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's plenty of horticulture
varieties where they keep flowering and do
[SPEAKER_01]: not senesce as early as they would in the
wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been selected for because
gardeners like garden flowers don't
[SPEAKER_01]: senesce.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think of your petunias or something
like that, they get a bit ratty over the
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this obligatory sudden shift to
senescence has certainly been overcome by
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether there are any that would
absolutely keep going, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laring and then a soybean in his
greenhouse that was something like 15 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had done it by continually removing
the fruits, the flowers and fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was essentially continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, if you now let that flower,
it would probably senesce extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the signal change in time where
the resources go seems to intensify the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've been cutting the flowers and
fruits off, you then let it grow just a
[SPEAKER_01]: few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will immediately put all the reserves
in that and senesce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's work being done to try and get
perennial rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what success they have had in
that yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it should be theoretically
possible because it's due to gene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression starting up at the beginning of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got to change that gene
expression, you should be able to stop the
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if there was work further
on the male-female spinach and hormonal
[SPEAKER_02]: signals that might be involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people in the field now are either
working on nitrogen partitioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's some work on microRNAs early
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the genetic work of shea shea,
I think that's where people are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much has been done on the hormones at
the present time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that amazed me, I was at a
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Denmark in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were papers there with exactly
the same phenomenon as I demonstrated here
[SPEAKER_01]: in rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had no idea what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because graduate students don't read
literature if it's older than five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of this is older than five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a message to graduate students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to some older literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sometimes find the answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it by biosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may be 10 pages down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they always start with the latest
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senescence is a messy business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes at the end of a plant's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of things are deteriorating,
as you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are just starting to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't really clean, except in
examples that you show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my scant experience in rice is that
it's one of the few major cereals where
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves actually stay green,
even though the grain is being harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another area of interest are state-green
newtons.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some of them, however, they found that
the leaves stay green.
[SPEAKER_01]: But photosynthesis declined, regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just staying green does not appear to
be the entire answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have something else in
addition to staying green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to comment on that,
Xuxi?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my screen saver on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to assume that that was your
olympic going dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sorry, Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get rid of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What comment would you make about tissue
sensitivity?
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of what we're going to talk
about, the form of it, but the converse is
[SPEAKER_04]: the changing sensitivity of the tissue to
these materials going way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nobody to my knowledge has mentioned
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen any changes in tissue
sensitivity at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, clearly a good topic for a PhD
thesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have run over time, so we're going to
need to call it to an end.
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly, if anyone has further
issues that they'd like to discuss with
[SPEAKER_06]: Professor Davies, he'll be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
