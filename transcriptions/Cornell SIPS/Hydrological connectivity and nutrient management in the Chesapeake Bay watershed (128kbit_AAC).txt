[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks a lot for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to be here giving a seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to focus mostly on
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in my abstract, I had listed
nitrogen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hoping to bring in some of the
work that we're doing on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just recently gave a talk at a
symposium on phosphorus that was down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Annapolis just a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of built my talk around that
one and kind of expanded it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to spend most of my
time talking about phosphorus and the role
[SPEAKER_00]: of hydrology and connecting phosphorus
sources on the landscape to receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a tour of the
Chesapeake Bay and mostly a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research we're doing, and then
highlighting some research from others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of helps to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of broken this presentation
out into four parts, starting with kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sloped upland regions of the
Chesapeake Bay, focusing on some issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: the coastal plain lowlands, mostly on the
Delmarva Peninsula, where we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work, where artificial drainage is a
primary concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Streams and rivers, so just the
connectivity that occurs in streams and
[SPEAKER_00]: rivers, moving nutrients, moving
phosphorus to downstream, receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then emerging concerns, just some
things I see as kind of emerging concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: in nutrient management that we should
probably be paying attention to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with an area that I
know really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see Todd Walters here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably seen some of these slides
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do a lot of work on variable source
area hydrology, as do many groups here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people have contributed to
kind of the ideas on the role of variable
[SPEAKER_00]: source area hydrology and connecting
nutrient sources with receiving waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we are now, just outside of
the Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of work at the Mahantango Creek
Experimental Watersheds, mostly this
[SPEAKER_00]: little 7.3-square-kilometer watershed,
known as W38.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a colloquial name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a gridded system that names
our watershed, so it's kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two subcatchments in W38
where we do quite a bit of experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's FD36, which I'll refer to a little
bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is Maddern's 11-hectare
experimental watershed, where we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: some work on variable source hydrology and
nutrient loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have kind of two different kinds
of soil conditions in this watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have upland soils here that lack,
say, some kind of a discontinuity in soils
[SPEAKER_00]: that would perch water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're well-drained soils that don't
have a fragile pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here in these lower landscape
positions, we have fragile pans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically impede vertical
movement of water and will perch water and
[SPEAKER_00]: will create areas of saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this highlights, you can see the
nature of these well-drained soils and
[SPEAKER_00]: compare them to the poorly-drained soils
that we find here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send technicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this quite a bit over the
years, kind of a very low-tech technique
[SPEAKER_00]: for looking at areas of saturation in
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the wet boot, or you've
probably seen the literature even as the
[SPEAKER_00]: squishy boot technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, there are papers published with
that in the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of Europe, especially, they've tried
to actually quantitate this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so we'll go out seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just find areas of saturation and take
a GPS unit and essentially map them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here in August of 2003,
for example, the location of some
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are disconnected saturated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So assuming they didn't change over time
with any kind of rainfall event,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're unlikely to connect to the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could compare that to something
later in the fall after we've had a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to wet up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These saturated areas expand quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now these are connected to this little
ephemeral stream here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any nutrient loss that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: in these zones would be a risk to water
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of runoff generation
mechanisms that we're concerned with,
[SPEAKER_00]: largely infiltration excess runoff in
these zones where we have well-drained
[SPEAKER_00]: soils where basically it takes a pretty
extreme rainfall, like a thunderstorm or
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity rain, to exceed the
infiltration capacity of the soils and to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can contrast that against what we
normally see in these zones, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a perched saturation excess runoff
phenomenon, where these soils are
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated and any excess rainfall runs
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also close to the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an increased risk of runoff
connecting to the stream and then nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we zoom in on this hill slope here,
we've done years of plot scale runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring at these sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are just totals for about
three years of monitoring, say 2002 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see most of the runoff
that's being generated in these
[SPEAKER_00]: well-drained soils here is infiltration
excess runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And largely at the lower landscape
position, it's saturation excess runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using shallow wells and looking at
the status of the water table and also
[SPEAKER_00]: soil moisture sensors to infer these
runoff generation mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over this time period, most of what we
get down here is saturation excess runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are largely saturated areas for
large parts of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the management that's imposed on
this landscape, you can see the trends in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil phosphorus moving up the slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at the lower landscape position,
we're just above agronomic optimum in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of soil phosphorus concentrations,
about 78 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just above what's needed to grow
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you move up the slope where we're
receiving more repeated applications of,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, manure or fertilizer, we've had much
higher soil phosphorus concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just relate those soil
phosphorus concentrations to the dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus concentrations and runoff,
you get increasing amounts of dissolved PN
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff with higher soil phosphorus
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's relationships have been shown
over and over in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because we know that doesn't mean
that we can necessarily predict the load.
[SPEAKER_00]: The load is driven by the amount of runoff
that's generated from a particular zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at the loads that we
get from these regions, it's really this
[SPEAKER_00]: region here, just because of its high,
large amounts of runoff that are
[SPEAKER_00]: generated, the high volumes of runoff that
we get, those are where we see the high
[SPEAKER_00]: loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are areas of the landscape
that we call critical source areas or
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrologically sensitive areas that go by
lots of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, the same thing where you
have a source and a transport mechanism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's close to the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a higher risk of phosphorus
loss from these regions of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some extra work looking at
these zones of saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work that Mark Williams,
who was a PhD student at Penn State,
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I'll just back up and just
show that these are kind of another look
[SPEAKER_00]: at these variably saturated areas in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mark came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He set up a network of piezometers in
these saturated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the FT-36 watershed just north
of Madden, also within kind of the Madden
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanker Creek experimental watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used electrical resistivity imaging
to try to understand a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the subsurface connectivity that we have,
what maintains saturation in these
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of fortuitous,
because we didn't do it for all that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were only able to do it for one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what you do is you use
electrodes in a transect here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're basically sending electric
pulses and measuring between current
[SPEAKER_00]: electrodes and potential electrodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And changes in resistivity can be used to
infer changes in soil moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also sensitive to changes in soil
temperature and to any kind of conductive
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can control for the other
things that affect it, you can infer that
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're seeing is really due to changes
in saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did some monitoring over a
series of storm events that wet up the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here, these are where
you see decreased resistivity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that we have a fragile pan
just about 60 centimeters below the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that boundary really clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of concluding from this is
that this is the perched water that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting above the fragile pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an area without a groundwater
seep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're comparing it to this zone
here where we have activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seepage going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at the area where we
have a seep, where we have upwelling
[SPEAKER_00]: water, you can see kind of an increased
upward gradient of groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can infer this from the piezometers
that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have piezometers at different depths
that allow us to look at gradients of
[SPEAKER_00]: water movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see evidence for this connected
saturated area here, which when we combine
[SPEAKER_00]: it with this evidence, it suggests that
this is an area of upwelling water and
[SPEAKER_00]: seepage that we see in these zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a video that I'm not sure if
we'll be able to get to play, but this was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken after a fairly large storm event in
this seepage zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the kind of, let's see if it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these things don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is after, I think this is after
Tropical Storm Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a huge amount of rain it took
to cause that kind of, but so the ERI is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of valuable because it allows you to,
as they say, visualize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get quantitative
information from it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some more work we're
doing with electrical resistivity imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was just some work looking at
just trying to get at the saturated or
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas of connectivity that you can
see with soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So subsurface phosphorus transport is kind
of an oft overlooked pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it, a lot of the literature over
time has suggested most of the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: is moving in overland flow, but we also
see a lot moving in subsurface flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've done work on a small dairy
farm in the Allegheny Plateau region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Pete Kleinman's work where we
were monitoring a spring house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is receiving subsurface flows from
up, there's fields above here that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the recharge area for the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also where a lot of manure is
applied because this is a dairy farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting pretty frequent,
regular applications of dairy manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the home here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this spring house used to serve water
for the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't any longer, but they actually
helped us do some monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were collecting samples from the
spring house over time and then keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: track of when manure was being applied to
the fields in the upgrading zone above the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see, these are the days
that manure, these are the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: manure is kind of applied spring and fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So April, October, and these are the times
of manure application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the trace of dissolved
phosphorus in the spring house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see soon after manure is
applied, you tend to get a spike,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a pretty significant spike here in
dissolved phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, smaller one here and
then another one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's responding pretty quickly to the
timing of manure application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get these subsurface transfers of
phosphorus, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just an overland flow problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a subsurface transport problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you can do to mitigate that include
just simple tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is especially problematic where we
have no till and you get a lot of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: development and macropore formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come in with frequent tillage and
break up the macropores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the macropores are what's serving as
the, you know, one form of kind of rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: connectivity between the surface and the
subsurface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one management tool is just to
till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here just by tilling,
you can reduce, you know, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved phosphorus and leachate relative
to if you just broadcast on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can connect to subsurface flow
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some things you can do to
get at reducing subsurface transfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common problem, and this is kind
of low hanging fruit stuff, but another
[SPEAKER_00]: common problem that we see, you know,
and this is some work we're doing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Piedmont, is just barnyard runoff from
animal heavy use areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, these are the kinds of,
you know, a lot of plain sec farms down
[SPEAKER_00]: the Piedmont region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a manure, this spilled manure
here in the barnyard area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just real simple things,
but cause a major water quality problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this, here's some photos of kind of
the condition of some of these barnyards
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of trampled, you know, animal heavy
use areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a lot of runoff just from the
barn, except from the roofs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are impervious surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a lot of runoff from these
zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been monitoring with flumes
just the amount of runoff that we get off
[SPEAKER_00]: these barnyards and also the quality of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just in this small area,
we're generating anywhere of 20 kilograms
[SPEAKER_00]: of phosphorus per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the barnyard is really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you actually scaled that to like a
kilograms per hectare per year,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number is astronomical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems almost unfair to report something
so high, but you get fairly substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus losses from these barnyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you have is basically,
you know, either some kind of rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: connection, like a gully in this case
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that water just hits that
gully and goes right down to a stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been working actually with
some kind of fancy filtration technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're routing water into these,
you know, base agrigane inlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's moving in to a fairly
sophisticated system that's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: get at not only nitrogen removal,
but also phosphorus removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Alexandra Drizo-Runza.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been experimenting a lot with
phosphorus filtration devices at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of her filters using,
I think, iron slag as the medium for
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these things work when the flows
are low, but when you get fairly large
[SPEAKER_00]: storms, they get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're asking a lot of a system
like this to filter the sheer volumes of
[SPEAKER_00]: water that are being generated from this
kind of an operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found is that probably
what's needed is just better water
[SPEAKER_00]: management, like gutters and things on the
roofs and keeping the clean water clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and separating that water from the dirty
water, and then just trying to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller volumes of the really bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this gets clogged up with
sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets clogged up with manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to look at, but we've had
all kinds of problems with it under big
[SPEAKER_00]: storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just underperforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a role for these things,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water management and just reducing the
volumes of water coming off some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: sites is kind of a low-hanging fruit that
I think would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of shifting gears a little bit,
moving from the sloped areas down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: coastal plain, we do a lot of work at the
University of Maryland Eastern Shores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the Delmarva Peninsula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Monocan River watershed
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the University of Maryland
Eastern Shore within the Monocan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some pretty extreme phosphorus
losses in artificial drainage at these
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, anywhere from two kilograms per
hectare per year all the way up to over 20
[SPEAKER_00]: in the area, in some cases from some of
the ditches on the Eastern Shore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of the main issue is
the role of artificial drainage and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically connecting phosphorus sources to
receiving waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so drainage is really critical in
these flat landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it to lower water tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lower them below the rooting zone so
they can grow crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also, they can get equipment
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do that, just the act of
putting it in a ditch or putting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tile, you lower the water table,
you increase the travel time of water in
[SPEAKER_00]: the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also increases conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dig that ditch deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of an act of intensifying
the drainage of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in another way, there's two ways to
intensify the drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to dig the ditch deeper or to have
the tile installed at a deeper depth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also spacing plays a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more closely spaced the ditches
are, the tiles are, the more intense the
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to look at this that is just
in terms of drainage density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of like a watershed
hydrology approach where you just look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the length of the channels in the system
divided by the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks have kind of looked at
it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case here, you have a 27
acre field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the existing ditches in the
field here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you calculate the drainage
density based on the area of the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: the length of ditches, it's about 0.02
meters to the negative 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical source areas of phosphorus
contribution to these ditches are largely
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close to the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're within 5 or 10 meters or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this evidence is from tracer
studies that have been done elsewhere just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at where's the contributing area,
kind of the annual contributing area to
[SPEAKER_00]: these ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you intensify the drainage,
which is going on quite a bit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: eastern shore, in other words,
if you just add more tiles or more ditches
[SPEAKER_00]: to the system, basically you've just
increased not only the connectivity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but also you increase the
contribution of phosphorus from areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: were not initially connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're connecting new phosphorus sources
to drainage and more rapidly removing
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've just increased the spatial
coverage of critical source areas across
[SPEAKER_00]: the basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of work's been done here at
Cornell looking at roadside ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just increasing the artificial
connectivity of the system and more
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly delivering nutrients to streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the ditch drainage for
agriculture problem, but there's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: roadside ditch problem that I know there's
been quite a lot of work that's done here
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Schilling in the Midwest did some
really interesting work just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the role of drainage density, increasing
the density of drainage on travel times
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically showed that there's an
exponential relationship between the mean
[SPEAKER_00]: travel time in years and the drainage
density of artificial drainage of your
[SPEAKER_00]: tiles or ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see at first if you start
to rapidly increase the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage, there's a pretty steep drop off,
but then it levels off to a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can keep adding tiles or keep adding
ditches and there's not much change in
[SPEAKER_00]: travel time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a pretty steep drop in travel
time, say 15 years or so from going 0.01
[SPEAKER_00]: to 0.02.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can change the travel times more
rapidly, move water off the site,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's also a problem for phosphorus
pollution and nitrogen pollution as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some data from Kevin King in the
Midwest just showing how quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus responds in tile drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it looks like you get these really
rapid responses where you get upticks in
[SPEAKER_00]: flow and then phosphorus responds right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just suggests very fast delivery of
phosphorus to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you combine that with evidence
from Marty Cipitolo at the USDA ARS and
[SPEAKER_00]: others have done this too, where they've
taken smoke machines and just blown smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: up the tile lines to find macropores and
soils, and it just shows how well
[SPEAKER_00]: connected these tiles are to these
macropore systems that form, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just have rapid conveyance of
phosphorus either in manure or soil
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, and it gets delivered straight
down the macropores into the tiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have very rapid delivery of
phosphorus out of these tiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a common problem in the
Midwest, and it's in part contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lake Erie situation that you've
probably all heard about, the toxic algal
[SPEAKER_00]: blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that phosphorus delivery is in
part being contributed by the tile
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage that's there and the rapid
expansion and intensification of tile
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage that's going on throughout the
Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back on the coastal plain, we see a very
similar kind of response in our ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a very large storm event here
in one of our field ditches and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid response in phosphorus
concentrations, really rapid rise,
[SPEAKER_00]: right timed with the peak of the
hydrograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 1.5 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it suggests very fast flow paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It peaks early in the hydrograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've looked across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some congestion that
groundwater is playing a big role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a lot of wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this ditch right here that goes
through these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just a very dense network of
shallow wells measuring the groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of phosphorus in the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, they're on the order of,
at the most, maybe 0.3 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: liter on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of collecting data once every
two weeks throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mean is more on the order of 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just think about this in a
mixing model context, as this being one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your end members of phosphorus,
it's unlikely that groundwater alone is
[SPEAKER_00]: the big source, even though these ditches
are largely draining the groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be another source that's
contributing to these fairly high peaks of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus that we routinely see,
about 1.5, up to sometimes 2 or 3
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per liter in these storm
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so work that Pete Vadas, who was with
our group for a while as a postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now he's at the Wisconsin ARS unit,
he had a network of shallow wells
[SPEAKER_00]: installed at different depths throughout
the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that there's a shallow
either a perch system or preferential flow
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways that rapidly deliver very high
concentrations of phosphorus sometimes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the order of 10 parts per million or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the upper foot, upper foot and a half,
say, of soil, you either get these high
[SPEAKER_00]: water tables in the spring that form,
so March, April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the water table down at the
University of Middle Eastern Shores is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably within a foot of the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get these storm events that
just move water very rapidly, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to have very high concentrations of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's most likely what we believe is
the contributing source of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where your highest phosphorus
concentrations in soil are, usually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: upper foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have concentrations of, say,
300 parts per million in that upper foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially where we see most of
the phosphorus moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pete Kleinman's done some work down at
UMES.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a mass balance approach
where we had edge of field flumes looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the volume of water and overland flow
and the loads that were being delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you can measure the loads in the
ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by difference, you can infer that
almost 92% of the phosphorus is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: moving in the subsurface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of just a mass balance look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just based on some other evidence,
we're inferring that the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: the riskiest sources for phosphorus
delivery to these ditches is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: within five to 10 meters of the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you move further away, the travel
times are long, and it's unlikely that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're contributing much, at least on a
kind of a regular basis, to these ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning to go in and do some
electrical resistivity imaging at these
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, too, because we're interested in
trying to understand more about these
[SPEAKER_00]: shallow subsurface flow pathways that are
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, we're going in with tracers
and using the electrical resistivity
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging and the tracers to tell us
something about shallow subsurface flow
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a test study, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We intend to do this under storm
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, we're just kind of testing it
out just to make sure we know what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with a team from Rutgers to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is Ray Bryant, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ray was here at Cornell for a good part
of his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now working with us at ARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's spraying a concentrated salt solution
of about five millisiemens per centimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: or so of just sodium chloride onto this
plot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also are injecting the solution
into wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to get a response,
basically, just to see if the ERIs can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us anything about movement of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're spraying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're basically doing time lapse ERI,
collecting these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are images of resistivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these areas of lower
resistivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where your highly conductive
solution is starting to infiltrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of look at it over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken these different time lapse
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see the advancement of a
salt plume in the subsurface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to understand a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the goal is really to understand
how these subsurface flow pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take them to get from the
field to the ditch?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually get, I mean,
the images are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do 3D videos of these things,
of the salt tracers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can actually derive quantitative
information from the time lapse ERI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're interested in understanding
more about the hydraulics of the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the conductivities of the soils,
the travel times, and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative hydrologic information you
can get from these kinds of images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we plan to go out this spring,
we hope, and inject tracers and do it
[SPEAKER_00]: under storm conditions when we expect
these shallow flow pathways to be active
[SPEAKER_00]: and to track them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on some kind of advanced
modeling that we've been doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we expect to have to do this over a series
of storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought maybe one storm will be
enough to just move it from the field to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that the travel times are
quite slow, even just within 5 or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: meters of the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking tens of days or longer for
some of this stuff to potentially move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could be looking at probably weeks
and weeks of time lapse imaging to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how long it takes the salt to move and
also where it's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might tell us a little bit
something about the pathways that are
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be also moving phosphorus from
the field to the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an issue of infrastructure
intensification on the eastern shore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just basically real simple things like
the poultry industry on the eastern shore
[SPEAKER_00]: is concentrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're constructing a lot of what
they call these zero acre farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's just poultry litter sheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not growing crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just producing poultry and
producing a lot of manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you take a site like this where
this is a kind of a before picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: using the curve number, kind of the amount
of runoff, the amount of stormwater you
[SPEAKER_00]: would generate on a site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you add four 600 foot by 66 foot
poultry barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've jacked up probably just because of
the impervious surface generate from the
[SPEAKER_00]: barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% increase in the amount of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that runoff has to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these ditches that are
probably going to convey more flow and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably increase the loads of phosphorus
in a landscape that's already phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of intensification is going
on quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more we drive down to the UMES,
we always see new areas of barns going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the issues that we're
concerned about is just water management
[SPEAKER_00]: just in and around the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example just from UMES where
they have these kinds of water management
[SPEAKER_00]: problems where you just have a lot of
water coming off the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, there was this particular
barn where the practice was subsidized by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not performing all that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consequences of that are,
let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is what you'll see is ditch
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the ditch that is responsible
for about 20 some 25 or so kilograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare per year of phosphorus loss just
in that ditch alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because it's, this is the shed
that was dripping all that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has a, it's a poultry litter
storage set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just these low hanging fruit kind
of problems where if you do a better job
[SPEAKER_00]: managing the water, you hopefully could do
a better job of at least reducing these
[SPEAKER_00]: just substantially high losses of
phosphorus that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say a little bit about in-stream
processes because there's been quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of work done just trying to understand
phosphorus movement in streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what we do, we kind of,
we do work at say one scale, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hill slope scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be monitoring also at the small
watershed scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also maybe at a large, so these are kind
of a nested watershed kind of approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're really interested in what's
going on, how these connect, how these
[SPEAKER_00]: different scales connect and what's going
on in the streams to help move phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is some work that Rich
McDowell did with Andrew Sharpley in the
[SPEAKER_00]: FT-36 watershed, just looking at the
different controls of base flow and storm
[SPEAKER_00]: flow on phosphorus movement in streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you see phosphorus
concentrations at four different flumes in
[SPEAKER_00]: FT-36.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at base flow, the concentrations tend
to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been attributed just to the,
you know, the sorption capacity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stream sediments, high capacity to absorb
phosphorus here and decreasing capacity as
[SPEAKER_00]: you move downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can contrast that with what you
see during storms where you have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite, more of a dilution effect
basically as you go downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus concentrations in stream
water tend to decline during storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's largely due to having kind of
basically a critical source area of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus loss here where you have a lot
of runoff generation and high phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in soils, and then that
signal kind of being diluted as you move
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when you kind of just
consider what are the annual export
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns of phosphorus, you know,
in streams, most of our flows are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, base flows, 90% of the flows in
any given year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, W38 would be classified as base
flow, and maybe 10% of the flows you would
[SPEAKER_00]: classify as storm flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just in terms of time,
just 10% of the time we have storm flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the annual export, you know,
is largely driven by storm flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 70% of the phosphorus loss is occurring
in storms and maybe only 30% or so in base
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, it's kind of this
unequal distribution of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurring a small amount,
a small portion of the time and at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an interesting study,
you know, so and a lot of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of that phosphorus loss is
particulate too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's moving, you know, with sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an interesting study that
came out in Water Resources Research from
[SPEAKER_00]: a group led by, I think, Fuzudo out of
Delaware, looking at just how long does it
[SPEAKER_00]: take to sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, by extension, they're also
including things like particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus to move from some of these
watersheds, say, to the Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just picked one of the watersheds
where they worked, the little Conestoga
[SPEAKER_00]: Creek, because it's in the Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting because,
you know, if you just think of sediment
[SPEAKER_00]: transport, you know, in the suspended
sediment transport, it's pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, storms can move at quite a
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they ran some, you know,
theoretical sediment transport models
[SPEAKER_00]: where they actually tried to account for
the role of storage, say, in floodplains
[SPEAKER_00]: and other areas of the stream system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are theoretical models,
so they still need to be tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you account for the time spent in
storage, the time average velocity of silt
[SPEAKER_00]: clay, which is probably the size fraction
that's mostly moving a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate P, it's about 0.2 kilometers
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can just consider that,
you know, it's at 80 kilometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, between, say, that stream and
the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at, you know, greater than
600 years to move phosphorus from that
[SPEAKER_00]: stream down to the bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is, you know, based on some of
the modeling work, and they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going back and looking with different
kinds of tracers to corroborate what their
[SPEAKER_00]: models suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it suggests millennia in some of
these, for some of these streams to really
[SPEAKER_00]: move a lot of that phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another one of these system lags
that's built, you know, that's built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at it from the best
management practice standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in BMPs to control sediment and
eroded phosphorus loss, how long is it
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take before that signal
propagates down, say, to the bay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, you know, based on their
work, they're saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many decades to hundreds of years or
more before you might see some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I just thought that was kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really big issue that you've
probably heard about with the Conowingo
[SPEAKER_00]: Dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought I'd touch on that a
little bit here, specifically related to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical Storm Lee, which was a huge storm
that occurred September 7th to the 15th in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the bigger floods that we've
experienced in the Susquehanna Drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows the kind of the
cumulative precipitation that fell across
[SPEAKER_00]: the region, you know, anywhere,
you know, six or eight inches or more of
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the sediment plume
that, you know, that was in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: that huge flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some work out from Bob Hirsch,
USGS, just showing the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus that was lost in that one
single event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the total phosphorus loss
61% of the phosphorus load in 2011 was
[SPEAKER_00]: attributed to Tropical Storm Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for one year, 61% of the load from
one event as a fraction of the last
[SPEAKER_00]: decade, the last 10 years, it accounted
for 22% of the phosphorus loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at Conowingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where these data are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 9% of the loss over the last,
say 35 years, the period of record that he
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at 1978 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, those of us in our group
and elsewhere, you know, we've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: been calling Conowingo Dam is like the
world's greatest BMP because it traps
[SPEAKER_00]: sediment, it traps a lot of phosphorus,
and it's kind of, you know, this barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: between the Susquehanna River and the
Chesapeake Bay downstream of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But perhaps it could be considered one of
the single greatest sources of legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus to the Chesapeake Bay because
you're getting its capacity, it's almost,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost reached capacity, the sediment
stored behind the dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become almost kind of a pass through
now where it's accumulated so much
[SPEAKER_00]: sediment that now just stuff is passing
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really depositing much behind the
dam anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing that's happened that,
you know, Bob Hirsch reported is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been a change in the concentration
discharge relationship, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: between flow and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you're getting much higher
concentrations of phosphorus for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these larger storms now are
generating much higher concentrations of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus than they did, say,
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's, this is Lee here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got concentrations of over two
milligrams per liter coming out where
[SPEAKER_00]: storms of similar magnitude in the past
wouldn't have produced such a high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work out of Johns Hopkins has also
shown kind of an uptick in total P,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is largely explained by
particulate phosphorus contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also scour going on behind the
dam, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another issue because it's full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing kind of an uptick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a decline here in total phosphorus
in all seasons, really, at Conowingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, just recently, they're starting
to see an upward trend in phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: release from the dam to downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's starting to become a source of
phosphorus, in part due to scour,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps due to dissolved P is still
actually going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a particulate P phenomenon
that's going on behind the dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of an interesting story,
and there's a lot of discussion in
[SPEAKER_00]: Annapolis and elsewhere about what to do
about the Conowingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just released a report last fall on
whether they should dredge it or not
[SPEAKER_00]: dredge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the recommendation was to not
dredge it and to leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, look going forward,
something to probably consider in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus management and the challenges
it represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll close here with just some emerging
concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that I thought is probably most
pressing from a nutrient management
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint is kind of the role of climate
change on hydrological connectivity and
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the FT-36 watershed, one of the
sub-watersheds where we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just shows the distribution of
phosphorus concentrations in soils from
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 50 all the way up to greater
than 400 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically, with the phosphorus
index, what we've done, or one approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: has just been to try to get at what's the
contributing area for different storms or
[SPEAKER_00]: storms of different return periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a real simple way is just to try to
come up with a linear distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: a buffer from the stream, and say that's
your zone of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've typically managed for these
frequently occurring one-year to two-year
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones we're most concerned
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come around most often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you did that just for this
particular watershed, your one-year storm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you draw a buffer around the system like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would say, this is a zone where
we're most actively going to protect for
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, with these reports that have
come out, there's been some really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting findings in terms of we've
seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at our own data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been, for example, a 71% increase
in the occurrence of extreme rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: events from 1958 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting more extreme rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been an increase in river flooding
across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most prominently, we've seen upticks
in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in FD36, this is just looking at
Tropical Storm Lee as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps it's an extreme case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I picked the most extreme because it
probably helped tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the peak discharge in FD36 was 53
cubic feet per second for Tropical Storm
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That equates to about a return period of
73 years for that storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a storm that occurs with that kind
of frequency, you draw a 100-meter buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: for a five-year storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get maybe a 10-year storm as a
150-meter buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond that, you're kind of only
getting a 10-year storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's almost the entire watershed
is, at that point, a critical source area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's not to say the entire
watershed is generating runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one would presume that any of these
areas could conceivably contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if these storms are going to become
more frequent, if there's any tendency for
[SPEAKER_00]: these storms become more common,
then I think in terms of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: management, one concern is just,
how do we manage for these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: events?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also the ones that move the most
pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at phosphorus loss,
just in W38, Harry Pionke was famous for
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that it's one or two storms in a
year that produce the majority of your
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's storms like this, then how do
we manage for these kinds of events?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, we've got about 10
minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably good that I'm
summarizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, in summary, for these sloped
areas, it's the hydrological particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: active areas that drive phosphorus
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the areas that we most are
interested in managing and protecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lowlands, where our primary concern
is artificial drainage and the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage in connecting phosphorus sources
to receiving waters and ways to manage and
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate the phosphorus moving from the
landscape to the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus transports in rivers is largely
event-driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the majority of that's occurring in
storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And changes in the frequency of extreme
events I would say represent an area of
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging concern that those of us who are
dealing in nutrient management should be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time and your
attention.
