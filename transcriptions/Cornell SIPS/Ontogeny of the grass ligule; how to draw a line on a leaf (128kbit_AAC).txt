[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I won't break into a lecture on
intro bio I used to teach in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: with Bob Turgeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you today about some
recent work that was done mostly by Robin
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson, who was a former postdoc in our
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of a collaborative grant with
Sarah Haake and Anne Sylvester,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bioinformatic data was all
analyzed by Chi Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, it was an NSF-funded
project, which we're now in a renewal,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, on proximal distal patterning
during maize leaf development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focus was on how you basically
form a boundary between two different
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we're working with the
ligule and the oracle, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: separating, in this case, on the maize
leaf, the distal blade, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic, of course, and the
proximal sheath, which is most of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in supporting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oracle and the ligule develop
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the epidermally derived film,
a fringe of tissue, all epidermally
[SPEAKER_00]: derived, and the oracle is derived from L1
and L2 layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it forms a nice line that separates
these two distinct developmental fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blade and the sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are very much distinct in their
differentiation at adulthood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can easily tell a blade, just from
epidermal characteristics, from sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very different in their
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might ask, you know, okay,
my family asked me, who cares about this
[SPEAKER_00]: little flip, blip of tissue on a leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a film of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, it's a great system to
study how boundaries are formed and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're organized between very distinct
developmental fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from lots of other studies that
organ boundaries are often the case where
[SPEAKER_00]: new axes of growth are initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how do you draw a line
on a leaf to separate these fields?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the mechanisms that specify
these distinct proximal distal fates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the earliest stages of
proximal distal development, it happens
[SPEAKER_00]: first when the leaf is initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's no ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't really see any difference between
the blade, what will be blade and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: sheath, which is really just a really
bottom portion of this leaf, primordium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the fate mapping tells us that
clearly most of this leaf is now going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're initiated from the street
epiglomeric stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an SEM I did many years ago of a
14-day-old seedling, ripped off all but
[SPEAKER_00]: two of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see two-leaf primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like in most other studied organisms,
I think everyone that's been studied in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants so far, initiation of leaves in
maize is correlated with localization of
[SPEAKER_00]: ox and transport proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an image that Robin made from a
plant that's expressing YFP-labeled pin 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pin 1 is an oxen efflux protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever you see these green lines on
the borders of these cells, you can assume
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much that oxen is leaving that
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see at the initiation point of
the next leaf, which is here, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, high accumulation of this
pin oxen efflux protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also can see a line that serves
towards the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle of the maristem, which will
eventually form the vascular trace of the
[SPEAKER_00]: midvein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this clearly on these more
well-developed P1 and P2 primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use those terms a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: P refers to plastocron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastocron is defined as the length of
time between successive innovations of a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf from the maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a P1 leaf is one leaf from the
maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: P3 is three leaves from the maristem,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastocron is a length of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can last a day or longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any P3 leaf from two different plants
will not be at the exact same stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: development, but they'll be close.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows that pin 1, we can infer
the direction of transport of oxen at the
[SPEAKER_00]: site of leaf initiation by looking at
where these pin proteins are localizing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it's moving down towards
where the leaf will initiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the ligula is derived completely from
the epidermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically work that was first
described in this detail by Anne
[SPEAKER_00]: Silvester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, like Charmin and people before
him, did a great job describing ligula
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell my students, if you want to
learn about plant anatomy, maze anatomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: maze morphology, look at Charmin first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Anne did a great job looking at these
early events in some great detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she defined that about the P5 stage,
so five leaves from the maristem,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this wide band of localized
anticlinal cell divisions, meaning they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plane of the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this range of small cells is
forming this wide band.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this the fat band, or the fat
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on, a little bit later in that
Plastocron typically, in a region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fat line, you can see a thin line that is
emerging by basically periclinal
[SPEAKER_00]: divisions, but send new growth outside the
plane of the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will become the ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the development of this is
basically elongation of that thin line
[SPEAKER_00]: from this fat line to form a fringe,
and later on, a full-blown ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Penn, this is work that was
first described by Sarah Haake in her lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Robin did this also in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bright field image, basically,
of a P5, P6 leaf primordium, probably
[SPEAKER_00]: about P6.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this line here, which is the
initiating ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at Penn localization,
we can see very clearly nice stripes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn localization over the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the L2-derived layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's internal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, there's a striking stripe of
perpendicular Penn localization,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will mark the initiating ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that in a cross-section here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't connect with the internal
vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some similarities already to
ligule initiation and leaf initiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the theme of this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at close-up versions of this
localization, we really can't infer any
[SPEAKER_00]: one direction of transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be emptying from all sides of
all cells, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't infer direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of ligule mutations, that this
resets the mutation to disrupt the ligule,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is work that was done mostly in the
90s and 80s by Mike Freeling and Sarah
[SPEAKER_00]: Haake's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are two ones I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is ligulus one, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This completely removes, this is messed
up, removes the ligule and the oracle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the line is intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be an image there of a
close-up of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligulus two, so in this case, ligulus one
removes the ligule, but the fat line is
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boundary is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit disrupted, but it's
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligulus two is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligulus two, there's a little patch of
ligule in the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see there's actually sheath
that is pushed up where the blade should
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the fat line is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boundary is disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure why these are showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This must be a PC Mac thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligulus one and ligulus two were both
cloned many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both different types of
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not important to us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cloned in the 90s, but actually
Robin was the first person to ever get a
[SPEAKER_00]: ligulus one in situ hybridization to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you see this purple staining
right here, that's ligulus one transcript
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the shoot Maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surrounded by lots and lots of these
tree-like looking primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see ligulus one first accumulating at
about P6.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the fat line is established,
where the thin line is emerging,
[SPEAKER_00]: where this fringe is just starting to grow
is where we first really see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in keeping with the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fat line is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boundary is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thin line is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligulus two is basically expressed
throughout the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what it's doing in this
shoot Maristem, but expressed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems to only localize.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let me speed this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are also a bunch of dominant
mutants at the strap proximal patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, the most famous one is knotted
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture I got from Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful mutation, dominant gain
of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these, which I'll talk about
today, are class one knotted-like
[SPEAKER_00]: homeobox, homodomain-containing proteins,
that's what they encode, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: mis-expressed, expressed ectopically in
the wrong place or in the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And classically, what they do is,
this is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligulus three, another class one NOX gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shoves sheath tissue distally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it replaces blade with sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this happens, you have a new blade
sheath boundary along this axis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time you have this new abutment
of ectopic sheath against blade,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get ectopic ligules forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ligules form with the boundaries
between blade and sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see it, because this is
mostly abaxial view.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ligule is adaxial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to look at this thing very
closely, this is a beautiful phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all sheath tissue, which is
expressing in the blade, mostly over
[SPEAKER_00]: veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we saw this on the opposite side of
the leaf, we'd see a little flap of
[SPEAKER_00]: ligule, every one of those little notches
of sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this phenotype led Sarah to specify
that perhaps knotted one makes sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she described the expression of the
RNA in the protein many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in the shoot marrow stem,
not in leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turned off in leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know now that auxin is responsible for
turning off NOX expression of RNA in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf primordium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it remains off, the RNA anyway,
remains off leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protein was shown many years ago by
Bill Lucas, Dave Jackson, and Sarah,
[SPEAKER_00]: through traffic, through trials with
desmona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see, as opposed to a knotted RNA,
which is not in the L1 layer of the marrow
[SPEAKER_00]: stem, we see in the protein in the L1
layer of the marrow stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see it in the base of these
leaf primordium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see RNA there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sarah thinks this is going to be
pre-sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sheath is very much unelaborated at
this stage of development early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It elaborates last, last part of the leaf
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she thinks that knotted specifies
sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did Robin do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she started with plants,
and she microdissected them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you how she did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did RNA-seq analysis of
microdomains, which I'll explain in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She analyzed the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we went back to the plants and looked
and see where these genes are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we want to actually test some of
our models, make mutants and double
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants, and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use laser microdissection in a lot
of my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did was she said,
OK, let's go to a P7 leaf, where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly see the ligule is just emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she took three sections, each one 100
microns tall, a pre-ligule or emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: ligule, pre-sheath, and pre-blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she left about 50 microns in between
to make sure there was no contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a close up of what our laser
microdissection scope can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We target this tissue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a thin section of a shoot apex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's placed on a slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ugly images.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cover slip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can see it, we can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the emerging ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can blast this now off the slide
into a collection tube, make RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: do RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only certain reads which map uniquely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maize genome is duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are unresolved paralogs,
we couldn't tell which one it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We threw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically how we compared the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show the GORI Venn
diagrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are lots of genes which are
differentially expressed in these
[SPEAKER_00]: three-way comparisons of ligule versus
sheath, ligule versus blade, and blade
[SPEAKER_00]: versus sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk mostly today about the
genes that are upregulated in the ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a control, we looked at ligulus 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew from the in situ and from earlier
data that it was expressed highly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this RNA-seq data confirms this,
basically not in the sheath or blade,
[SPEAKER_00]: very significantly upregulated in the
ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we trusted the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think laser microtest section works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of genes are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the gene that was the most highly
differentially expressed in the ligule,
[SPEAKER_00]: over 108-fold versus the ligule,
50-fold versus the blade, was this gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a grass-specific, so far as we
can tell, gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't find punitive orthologs of this
gene outside the grasses, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the ligule really is a
grass-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's expressed, basically,
a little bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: P6, right from the fringe, is starting to
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on, it localizes to this notch,
this boundary between the emerging ligule
[SPEAKER_00]: and the blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even later on, it's clearly in that
notch between the ligule and the blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beautiful and powerful expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the surprising thing was, we also
found this gene was expressed at multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: organ boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a close-up of the shoot apical
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a patchwork of several in
situ photographs that Robin made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it's expressed at the
boundaries of lots of lateral organs,
[SPEAKER_00]: between this incipient leaf primordium and
the meristem, between this leaf primordium
[SPEAKER_00]: and the meristem, or the shoot,
between this lateral bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like it's expressed at
multiple organ boundaries, this
[SPEAKER_00]: grass-specific gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was basically a theme throughout
this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the genes we found was CUC2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homologous to a gene in Arabidopsis,
which is a member of a lateral organ
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary gene family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expressed at organ boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's expressed clearly in this cleft
between the emerging ligule in P8
[SPEAKER_00]: primordia and the blade, at the boundary
between the ligule and the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also expressed at boundaries
between leaf primordia, between lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: bud primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like ligule genes are boundary
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gene called BOP4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is clearly homologous to probably the
ortholog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a gene from barley, which is a unicom
or a branching mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fail to make tillers or branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also ligulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed highly in the ligule,
shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also expressed in these lateral
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will give rise to ears in maize,
give rise to tillers in barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a branch primordia gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found two bell-like home L-box
genes, which caught our eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bell home L-box genes interact with class
I NOX genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that NODED1, ligutus 3,
is there enough to make a ligule develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they appear to interact with these
bell-like genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our eye was caught by these two genes,
bell 12 and bell 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they're expressed nicely in the
ligules, in this notch here, and also in
[SPEAKER_00]: the developing ligule itself, but also in
the boundaries around the ligule,
[SPEAKER_00]: not maybe the oracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that marking, but also lots of
other organ boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligules and organ boundaries is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one just to drive this
home, bell 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in a much wider region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the ligule notch, but it's also in
the region around the ligule and not
[SPEAKER_00]: localized to the ligule oracle region at
all, especially early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also expressed at multiple
lateral organs and their boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are they interacting with in a
ligule?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know NODED1 is not expressed in the
ligule region, but ligutus 3 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing experiments now to see
whether or not these bells can physically
[SPEAKER_00]: interact and direct gene expression by
binding with ligutus 3 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed higher up in the ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin showed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, again, was the first person to get a
ligutus 3 in situ to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's upregulated in NODED mutant
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good candidate for
interacting with bells way above the
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin showed me this data and said there's
a wax transcription factor that's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed transcription
factor in the ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's caught my eye, because I've been
working on a pair of wax genes for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narrow Sheet 1 and Narrow Sheet 2 asked,
is this Narrow Sheet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was totally surprised, because we
described this as a gene which functions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shoot meristem to specify a leaf
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a Narrow Sheet 1, Narrow Sheet
2 mutant, which is missing a big chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is made early in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ligule missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the close up of this blade
sheath boundary, there's a lot of ligule
[SPEAKER_00]: missing prior to wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we figured, OK, if you don't make leaf
early, you can't make a ligule on that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never expected this thing would be
expressed in the ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We described it as being expressed in the
meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cross section of the shoot
apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where Narrow Sheet is expressed to
direct those lateral domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find leaf initiation genes,
which are redeployed, re-initiated at the
[SPEAKER_00]: primordium to make a ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example, a gene called
Fabulosa 1, first described in Rabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: as being involved in dorsal ventral
patterning at axial or top layer
[SPEAKER_00]: patterning of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in the shoot apical
meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in leaf primordia
throughout the vasculature in the
[SPEAKER_00]: protozylum and the xylem, which is at
axial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also highly expressed in the
ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another leaf initiation gene,
which is redeployed at the ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall theme here is that ligule
genes are organ initiation and boundary
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, branch genes and leaf genes,
which are redeployed later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't expect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes perfect sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't expect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense because we know that
evolution is pretty conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really good at making brand new
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually takes and borrows mechanisms
and processes from other events and
[SPEAKER_00]: modifies them slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's basically the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crazy model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually formed this model by drawing
all over Sarah Haig's walls in her living
[SPEAKER_00]: room during a meeting we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the final version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complicated, but basically,
OK, ligule initiation reiterates lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: organ initiation, but it's not completely
reiterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look, for example, at the
localization of pin protein, it connects
[SPEAKER_00]: to the vasculature in a leaf primordium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't connect to the vasculature in a
ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ligules in Mays, anyway,
are not vasculorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that there's a interaction
between NOX proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auxin is repressed by NOX proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These boundary genes, like CUCs,
are repressed by pin, by auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so NOT is localized to the base of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get these stripes of, if you look at it
in this transfer section, it's easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's pin localization, auxin,
which is removing the NOX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also removing the CUCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they form this boundary where this pin
is formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the ligule will
initiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that these bells interact
with some NOX proteins in this region
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which will form the auricle and the
ligule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope we can get it refunded,
and we can test some of these predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: and test this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sure it's not exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take some questions if there are any.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
