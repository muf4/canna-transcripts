[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not going to be your typical
scientific seminar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to cover the basics of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a climate scientist, but I've also
dedicated an awful lot of time learning
[SPEAKER_07]: the science of climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to cover the basics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're all going out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your credit card out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're going to have an expensive
meal, but the point is what's changing on
[SPEAKER_07]: the menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'm going to talk about what Cornell
is doing, both a little bit from the
[SPEAKER_07]: academic side, which you're all part of,
but also facilities and operations.
[SPEAKER_07]: There really is a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just launched a report from the senior
leadership sustainability group on a set
[SPEAKER_07]: of recommendations to get us to carbon
neutrality by 2035.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to summarize that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony failed to mention that our latest
publication, we actually published
[SPEAKER_07]: together, made the front cover of weed
science.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, was that it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tony and provide a little bio,
but I'm going to add a few more things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here I am milking a cow in Costa Rica a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing you never forget,
and that's like riding a bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: You never forget how to milk a cow.
[SPEAKER_07]: When the tour guide was just blown away
that I could milk a cow, and I did it
[SPEAKER_07]: rather effectively.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got really excited about this
anaerobic digester back there,
[SPEAKER_07]: and he said, we've never had a tourist who
could milk a cow and got it excited about
[SPEAKER_07]: the manure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up on a little farm in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a pet crow named Carl, although
recently I realized it may have been
[SPEAKER_07]: Carla.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you're nine years old,
you don't have that kind of conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: with your pets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spend time in the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tell this story because it helps with a
lot of different audiences.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not just a professor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk to this group.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also held leadership roles at
Cornell, and when you're in one of those
[SPEAKER_07]: roles, you're supposed to see the big
picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just be an entomologist anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also a parent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Climate change is personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to affect my daughters.
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, the homeland security motto is
if you see something, say something,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to say something.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many trekkies?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd they get their food?
[SPEAKER_07]: Replicators, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happens when they blew both their
engines?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the guy, the Klingons?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're incapacitated.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're lost out in space, in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of looks like the same place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a whole lot of places to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to take care of what we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's better to tell the truth,
make you a little uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Endeavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: First time I saw this.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a remarkable selfie.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that orange band is the troposphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here about this part of the world's
maybe five, six miles high.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the action occurs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where 80% of the climate change
activity occurs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a very, very thin blanket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Solar radiation comes down, hits the
surface of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's white snow, most of that energy is
reflected back.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it comes down and hits a dark surface,
it's absorbed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that energy is then irradiated as
IR.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just learned this the other day
listening to Toby Ault.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had a candle in your hand and you
feel the warmth, is it the actual air
[SPEAKER_07]: that's warming up?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the radiation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same kind of energy reflecting
off the surface of the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's greenhouse gases, which are essential
to life on the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of those are reflected back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're simply adding more and more
greenhouse gases to that thin little
[SPEAKER_07]: layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That blanket is getting thicker.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is getting warmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the greenhouse gases, carbon
dioxide, on the bottom is year 1,000,
[SPEAKER_07]: year 2,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the Industrial Revolution,
how quickly things have changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we started burning fossil fuels,
fossil fuel, we should be at about 270
[SPEAKER_07]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're now at 404 more or less,
40% above normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we keep going, business as usual,
it hit 900 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means we'll have 60 days here in this
part of the world above 90 degrees in the
[SPEAKER_07]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing new.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tyndall and others had this worked out in
the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a greenhouse gas is all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that I've had farmers
say to me is, when I mentioned this,
[SPEAKER_07]: carbon-12 is actually increasing the
atmosphere, and it comes from the burning
[SPEAKER_07]: of ancient plants or fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another direct indicator that the
burning of fossil fuels is changing the
[SPEAKER_07]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is 97 out of 100.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scientists agree we are the cause.
[SPEAKER_07]: Climate change is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's now 99 out of 100.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty solid evidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another way to look at this is,
the atmosphere is a bathtub.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're filling it up with greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_07]: The natural systems, which would be the
drain, the oceans, the plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: et cetera, to absorb the greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, can no longer keep up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're putting more water in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_07]: The drain has not changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bathtub is filling up.
[SPEAKER_07]: The relationship between carbon dioxide
and temperature, going back 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know where these data come from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice cores.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ice, the bubbles in ice, and if you
look at the top, you can see how the CO2
[SPEAKER_07]: fluctuates over the years from 400,000
years to current time, and so does the
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much aligned.
[SPEAKER_07]: CO2 decreases, temperature decreases.
[SPEAKER_07]: CO2 increases, temperature increases.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, here we are in current
times going off the chart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Transportation, about a third.
[SPEAKER_07]: Electricity production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any idea how many cars are produced per
day on the planet?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll make something up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's like 180,000 a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many flights, commercial flights a
day?
[SPEAKER_07]: 93,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are things we take, you know,
we enjoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's my 93 Volvo up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still drive that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So electricity and distributed agriculture
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: contributes about 10% of greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Worldwide, it's more like 18 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not always fair to point one's
finger at agriculture as a major,
[SPEAKER_07]: yes, it's a contributor, but there's a lot
of other sources of these greenhouse
[SPEAKER_07]: gases.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's just summarize.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gained about one and a half degrees
globally.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's warming twice as fast at the poles.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Iditarod, the dogsled race.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year now, they're concerned they'll
even have it, and they keep moving further
[SPEAKER_07]: north.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2001, 2010, the hottest decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2015, the hottest year.
[SPEAKER_07]: This year will surpass all previous years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hotter summers, warmer winters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nights are warmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Warming faster than days.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rate of warming is very fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna gain as much heat in the next
100 years as we have since the last ice
[SPEAKER_07]: age.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we can't turn this off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if we stopped and really behave
today, it'll take hundreds, if not
[SPEAKER_07]: thousands of years to sort of equilibrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the distinction between climate and
weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weather is what's happening outside today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over short-term, climate is decades in
length.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we face a challenge, a grand challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: The evidence, with a few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I did my TEDx talk, we looked for
great pictures of glaciers, and we had
[SPEAKER_07]: this beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, let me check.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was actually highlighted because it
was one of the few glaciers that's
[SPEAKER_07]: actually growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't use that picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glaciers are melting worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an important source of irrigation
water in Chile and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_07]: countries.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't been to Glacier National
Park, I suggest you get there soon,
[SPEAKER_07]: because the glaciers will be gone in about
20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking to my daughters about where
they wanna go next year, and they wanna go
[SPEAKER_07]: to Glacier Park while the glaciers are
still there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is summer sea ice in the Arctic.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a, actually I looked just today at
where we are with retreating sea ice in
[SPEAKER_07]: the summertime.
[SPEAKER_07]: It rapidly freezes over and is rapidly
freezing right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is an image of in September,
and you can see it's about 700,000 square
[SPEAKER_07]: miles less than it should be when you
compare to historical records.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's an example of where solar
radiation comes in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absorbed by that deep blue ocean,
warms the water, melts more ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a concern as the passage
is open here, because it will,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, one, there's a military concern
because of more Russian and Chinese
[SPEAKER_07]: transport, but also invasive species that
exist in bilges and ships, because the
[SPEAKER_07]: ships are gonna get from point A to point
B much faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a likelihood of more of those
kinds of invasives being moved around the
[SPEAKER_07]: planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oceans are changing, 30% more acidic than
they should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rising thermal expansion accounts for
about a third of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much more comes from melting glaciers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, I think most everyone's aware
the acidification is affecting shell
[SPEAKER_07]: forming organisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many have hugged a redwood?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kinda hard not to, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are these the largest creatures on earth
living?
[SPEAKER_07]: No?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, they're big.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're massive, and they're hard not to
hug.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the sierras, invasive species and
other plants are moving up the sierras
[SPEAKER_07]: because of warming conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So someone asked the question,
what about the redwoods?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it turns out there's just this
narrow band of perfect soil conditions for
[SPEAKER_07]: the redwoods.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in time, they're already under stress,
but in time, they will be compromised by
[SPEAKER_07]: warming temperatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even these grand creatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about agriculture and food
security.
[SPEAKER_07]: With all these changes, it's no longer
business as usual.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more variability, more risk,
and the impacts are local to global.
[SPEAKER_07]: Food production is moving north.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've essentially shifted close to one
planting zone north.
[SPEAKER_07]: This obviously has impact for farmers in
Manitoba, where they've expanded grain
[SPEAKER_07]: production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing seasons are longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gained about 10 days here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out west, it's more, 19 than northwest.
[SPEAKER_07]: 16 days, but that doesn't necessarily mean
additional growing days for farmers
[SPEAKER_07]: because of more extreme weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having wet spells in the spring or
in the fall and interferes with harvest or
[SPEAKER_07]: planting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of our farmers have heard Dave Wolf
mention this a while back, where they're
[SPEAKER_07]: splitting their planting.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get in early while they have a dry
period early spring with a long season
[SPEAKER_07]: corn, and then they'll wait for the wet
spell and then they'll come in with a
[SPEAKER_07]: short season corn later on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they still get a crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're having more heavy precipitation
events, especially in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're up 71%.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the Libby pumpkin, which grows
90% of their, excuse me, grows almost all
[SPEAKER_07]: their pumpkins within 90 miles of their
processing facility in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2012, they had a very wet spring.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2014, a very wet fall, which meant
planting or harvesting of pumpkins was
[SPEAKER_07]: compromised.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in 2012, they had about half the
crop you normally would.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they produce almost all the pumpkin
pie filling in the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is serious.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about pumpkin pie filling,
but it's an example of diversification.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spread out your risk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't plant all your pumpkins close to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a quote from a farmer we've
done some videos of farmers interviewing
[SPEAKER_07]: them, their perceptions of climate change,
and just happened to go to this farm right
[SPEAKER_07]: after a heavy downpour, and he had lost
$80,000 worth of alfalfa seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had just planted it, but the heavy
rain, everything was washed away.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a farmer, you can weather the storm,
but you can't weather continuous storms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Panyan in 2014, they had five inches of
rain in four hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice slip down the Long Island had 18
inches in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more of these events are
occurring.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is where I really get into the
climate change for job security sake.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are more insects, excuse me,
the likelihood of with longer seasons,
[SPEAKER_07]: more generations, new invasives coming in,
the bottom, the corn earworm down here,
[SPEAKER_07]: what is a pest primarily of sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Historically, when I started that corn
now, it was a late season corn,
[SPEAKER_07]: a late season pest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's here year round presumably
because now it can overwinter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week, there was a forum in Washington
DC on climate and pest, and I heard Lou
[SPEAKER_07]: Ziska, a wheat scientist, talk about some
of his work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a call from someone in the ARS lab
and say, we got this old seed that's like
[SPEAKER_07]: 60 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we throw it away?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, oh, yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he went, wait a minute,
that seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those plants grew under much lower CO2
levels than what we have today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he did some comparisons or clearly the
weeds have evolved, but he summarized his
[SPEAKER_07]: talk like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Preliminary suggests that weeds impose
greater limitations on crop production
[SPEAKER_07]: than earlier assumed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The worst weeds, often wild relatives of
crop may be able to better adapt to
[SPEAKER_07]: increase CO2 and temperature associated
with future changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, adaptation on wild
weeder lines may serve as a means to
[SPEAKER_07]: enhance adaptation of cultivated lines,
especially cereal lines to increase
[SPEAKER_07]: production as CO2 increases.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna both be fighting weeds,
but also learning from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were several other stories at
this forum on crop diseases and even
[SPEAKER_07]: insects.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are just some of these subtle but
kind of scary changes that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an interesting prediction looking
forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: The gray band is historical high and low
average temperature by year from roughly
[SPEAKER_07]: 1850 to current times.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's projections.
[SPEAKER_07]: The red line would be business as usual,
worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it shows is by 2050, the coldest
year we will experience will be above any
[SPEAKER_07]: high temperature we've ever seen in
previous 150 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're moving essentially to a temperature
band.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch carefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is average temperatures from the 1800
to 2100.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to show increasing
temperatures over the next 150 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're not supposed to go by two
degrees C.
[SPEAKER_07]: That will happen at roughly 2028.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the end of the century,
we're past five degrees C.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wanna see that again?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have till two o'clock?
No?
One?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go through this one more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's looking forward in temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look forward in precipitation
patterns.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just find New York on the map and you'll
see it's darker blue and thatched.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means we'll have generally increase
in overall precipitation, annual
[SPEAKER_07]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the winter and the spring, fall,
so-so, summer's a little drier.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then look at the southwest.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna get drier and drier and drier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean that we here in the
northeast have an opportunity to actually
[SPEAKER_07]: diversify and expand agriculture because
we will have water in the coming years?
[SPEAKER_07]: Now if anybody follows Toby Ault's work,
there's two papers, one in 2015 and one in
[SPEAKER_07]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the risk of a mega drought.
[SPEAKER_07]: A mega drought is 35 years in length or
greater.
[SPEAKER_07]: The arrows point to mega droughts where
civilizations collapsed in the southwest
[SPEAKER_07]: back in 1150 and about 1300 because of
long-term droughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the odds of us having a mega drought
went from the first paper to 80% to 99% in
[SPEAKER_07]: the southwest.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has an extraordinary impact on
agriculture in California, agriculture in
[SPEAKER_07]: Mexico, and just communities there and
cities as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if you can make a dollar on
something, why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a beer called Global Warmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a very good beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's seasonal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea why it's seasonal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't always get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the little, on the back it said,
extended refrigeration at retail magnifies
[SPEAKER_07]: beer's carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please enjoy as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comes in a four-pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's go out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: So growing food is changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supply chains are changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Price volatility is increasing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had the opportunity three,
four years ago to actually meet with the
[SPEAKER_07]: president of Kraft Food at that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a Cornell alum and I brought up
climate change and she paused and said,
[SPEAKER_07]: price volatility is costing us about $3
billion a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a big company, but that's a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a business issue as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to start with the right ingredients
for a good meal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Agave, grown in northern Mexico and it's
been subject to the drought.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 10-year crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's under severe pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're messing with tequila.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cork trees around the Mediterranean with
higher temperatures, the bark is changing
[SPEAKER_07]: and they make like a billion corks a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you drink really good stuff where
the cork is important because there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: breathability issue, that's changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So your product will be different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're considering synthetic corks,
et cetera, but the cork trees are
[SPEAKER_07]: changing, which is having an impact on
these kinds of beverages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Olives, some are grown in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point there is California is
starting to lose its winter chill,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is essential for fruit and many nut
crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the longer term, UCF did a report
and I think they said they're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: lose about 40% of their winter chill by
the middle of the century.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to affect plums, peaches,
pears, apricots, grapes, you name it,
[SPEAKER_07]: in the longer term.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a kind of a ominous change or
subtle change in the background that a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of people don't fully appreciate.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're producing whiskey in Kentucky,
the angel is getting a bigger share.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's evaporation through the oak
barrels.
[SPEAKER_07]: The oak barrels are stored essentially out
of doors in, there's a term, they're
[SPEAKER_07]: buildings, but they're open to the
outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as temperatures increase, there's more
evaporation and more loss of alcohol
[SPEAKER_07]: through the oak.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually enough that they're
getting a little worried and they call
[SPEAKER_07]: that the angel share.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least the angels are happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, salad, avocado production in
California, will be off about 40% in 30
[SPEAKER_07]: years because of increasing temperatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to grow organic tomatoes in this
part of the world now because of these
[SPEAKER_07]: early heavy downpours and the risk of late
blight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have to be grown under plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to grow lettuce in Salinas
Valley in the future, you'll probably need
[SPEAKER_07]: to switch to more heat tolerant varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wine is affected because grapes are very
sensitive to temperatures changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to affect California
grapes and maybe be an advantage for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grain production worldwide is off a little
because of more extreme in weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lobsters off the coast of Maine,
they've moved north 50 miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: The oceans off the coast of Maine are
warming eight times faster than most any
[SPEAKER_07]: other place on the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also affected the shrimp industry,
which has pretty much crashed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there were saffron in this rice,
most saffron has grown in Iran,
[SPEAKER_07]: but about 10 to 15% is from Kashmir in
India.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of changes in precipitation
patterns and temperatures, they're going
[SPEAKER_07]: out of business.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's affecting thousands of farmers in
that part of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't even want to talk about this
one, but yes, coffee.
[SPEAKER_07]: I happened to be in Costa Rica,
as I mentioned a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: and walked through some coffee plantations
and, you know, it's getting warmer and
[SPEAKER_07]: warmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they simply move up the side of the
mountains a little further, but obviously
[SPEAKER_07]: they're going to run out of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to run out of space.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a coffee borer spreading
worldwide, in part related to climate
[SPEAKER_07]: change.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also impacting the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla grown on the coast of Madagascar
is moving inland because of more storms,
[SPEAKER_07]: increased transportation costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cocoa probably moved from Western Africa
to Central and South America.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the point is, next time you go to a
restaurant, just look at all that's
[SPEAKER_07]: available to us and changes occurring.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what if you're in a country that's
poor, where agriculture is rain-fed and
[SPEAKER_07]: you really have limited resources?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we face a food security challenge
globally, so national security challenge,
[SPEAKER_07]: a moral challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are arguments that the war in Syria
started because of a long-term drought,
[SPEAKER_07]: started driven by climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, a few years ago,
there was a conference on campus,
[SPEAKER_07]: where Chris Barrett led it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was not the one, that really big one
last year, but about four or five years
[SPEAKER_07]: ago, was actually funded by the CIA.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they publish.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in the background, but I was part
of that sort of background dialogue,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had the honor or privilege of being
in Vietnam in March, and here's a country,
[SPEAKER_07]: the Mekong, 17 million people living five
feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're already affected by saltwater
intrusion and some other complications.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a land and a people on water,
which is just remarkable to watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can also envision what would
happen, what will happen with sea level
[SPEAKER_07]: rise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have also 2,000 miles of
coastline.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful country, if anybody gets
a chance to go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just remarkable and wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just for the record, we're actually
planning to take students there in
[SPEAKER_07]: January, and one of the internationalizing
Cornell curriculum programs, to spend two
[SPEAKER_07]: weeks in the Mekong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Food security's in the news.
[SPEAKER_07]: Press picks us up, sharp swings in
ingredient prices, we're aware of,
[SPEAKER_07]: so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's this concern in the food
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And another example of a potential
conflict with rising waters in Bangladesh,
[SPEAKER_07]: and changing temperatures in India,
movement of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: In multiple countries with nuclear
weapons.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a moral issue, I'm sure you've
heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Pope came out in support of getting
her act together.
[SPEAKER_07]: There've been religious summits,
the Dalai Lama, Hirsch, Desmond Tutu,
[SPEAKER_07]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we take a breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get pretty depressed, overwhelmed
by all of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we could move, we could ignore,
deny, we're all too busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually in part not in our DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not responsive to threats that are
far in the future, or somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're more of the immediate, we respond to
immediate threats.
[SPEAKER_07]: And generally life is good and we're busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, a call to action.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a short book written by Mary
Piper, it's called The Green Boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: She lays out, and it's her personal story
on how she, as one person, made a change
[SPEAKER_07]: related to climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually related to energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Become aware, listen to the science,
accept it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the oh shoot moment, or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then act.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love this quote from Zorba the
Greek, to live is to roll up your sleeves
[SPEAKER_07]: and embrace trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've got something to put our
arms around right here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna talk about some of the things
going on here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both on the sort of the academic side,
but also the operations facility side.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're all aware, this is a land
grant, but in particular we have
[SPEAKER_07]: incredible strength in climate change and
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have much capacity beyond that,
but we have particular strength at the
[SPEAKER_07]: nexus of climate change and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I made a list of some of the things
going on, and there's many more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Strength in plant breeding, soil health,
nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hot cows give less milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sometimes show a picture of some
research out of UC Davis, and it shows a
[SPEAKER_07]: picture of a dairy cow on a platform,
and there's a shower.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cow is getting a shower.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea was a cow comes in, gets a
shower, cools off, and leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: The trouble is the cows didn't leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just stayed there, so they had to put
a little kicking device to get the cows to
[SPEAKER_07]: move on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have exceptional talent in
communications and climate change,
[SPEAKER_07]: water management, IPM, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Northeast Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a collaborative environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the right place to take on this
challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Atkinson Center.
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovative research.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a climate forum making
connections through topical lunches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some new initiatives, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Climate Change Hubs created in 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a sub-hub on campus at
the ARS facility, but their agenda is to
[SPEAKER_07]: bring all parties together, land grants,
extension, stakeholders, non or NGOs,
[SPEAKER_07]: et cetera, and coordinate their efforts.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also the relatively new Cornell
Institute for Climate Smart Solutions,
[SPEAKER_07]: which focuses primarily on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, the Climate Smart Farming
Program.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an example of what happening,
the Climate Smart Farm Extension Team.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first in the country where six
of our educators actually have part of the
[SPEAKER_07]: responsibilities to work on climate
change.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're distributed around the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have different responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most are with regional teams.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing being developed by the
institute are tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a growing degree day tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the faculty and programmers,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: We help facilitate this.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a freeze risk tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And somewhat relevant to this drought for
this last year, there's also an irrigation
[SPEAKER_07]: scheduler that looks out 30 days and gives
probability about plant stress given
[SPEAKER_07]: different scenarios.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can put in soil type, you can put
in crop type, you can put in location,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it'll give it for your particular,
this kind of prediction for your
[SPEAKER_07]: particular farm or location.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Cornell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking the walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure how many follow this,
but we are now committed to carbon
[SPEAKER_07]: neutrality by 2035.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really big challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a climate action plan that's been
around for several years that has
[SPEAKER_07]: something like 60 recommendations to help
us get to a lower carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two years ago, there was an acceleration
working groups.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how do we speed that all up?
[SPEAKER_07]: I co-chaired that.
[SPEAKER_07]: More recently, there's a senior leadership
campus committee that just released their
[SPEAKER_07]: report a couple of weeks ago on how to get
us to carbon neutrality.
[SPEAKER_07]: As mentioned early on, there's also the
President's Sustainable Campus Committee.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have responsibility for
implementation of a lot of these
[SPEAKER_07]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as an institution, we're a living
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: Faculty and staff can work on these issues
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a big place.
[SPEAKER_07]: 21,000 students, 1,600 faculty,
8,000 staff, 600 buildings, 2,000 acres of
[SPEAKER_07]: land, 25,000 light switches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Annual.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's, this summarizes the greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is basically 2008 to 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2010, we went from coal buying in power
plant running for gas.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this shows the combustion emissions
obviously dropped in 2010 when we got off
[SPEAKER_07]: coal.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to buy electricity, but we're
buying less after 2010 because now we
[SPEAKER_07]: produce a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Commuting is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of travel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, sports teams do a lot
of travel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Air travel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some of this is offset a little
bit by forest sequestration and the fact
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're also selling on occasion
electricity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this shows the net emissions,
essentially a 30% decrease over that time
[SPEAKER_07]: span.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the same time, an energy
conservation initiative helped campus
[SPEAKER_07]: actually grew by about 20%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unusually cold winter in 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I'm going to bear with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: What time?
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 minutes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just summarize rather quickly what
has been done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're familiar with lake source
cooling.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has reduced energy used to cool the
campus by 86%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combined heat and power plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody ever had a chance to tour that,
it's essentially two 747 jet engines
[SPEAKER_07]: running on natural gas.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're producing electricity and the
heat, the exhaust creates steam.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all captured instead of wasted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Solar power.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you fly in or out of Ithaca Airport,
I'm sure you've seen the solar array out
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's now one at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Black Oak project,
the wind project has the green light.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not absolutely sure, but Cornell is
one of the few, if not the only
[SPEAKER_07]: universities in the world or the US that
has a hydroelectric plant, produces all of
[SPEAKER_07]: 1% of our electricity.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to produce all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lead buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody know what that is?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with the gates building right
there?
[SPEAKER_07]: You see those fins?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're directly connected by metal to the
inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a transfer of heat out or cold
in and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the things that are
changing with the new codes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let deans and architect put up
buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need an energy person there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they've got to look pretty and et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Energy conservation.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play tennis, they put new lights
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's saving a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like $20,000 per year in energy
costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's about 50 buildings on campus
have this dashboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went this morning and I checked on
Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not the best building to do this
and how much energy was used.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so far this week, starting Monday at
12 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: to roughly a few minutes ago, 40,000
kilowatt hours of electricity for
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_07]: $3,600 in cost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And 36,600 pounds of CO2 operate that
building.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the entire year, it costs about
$300,000 per year.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty easy, pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go in and type in any building.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives kind of immediate feedback on
energy use in a building.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only electricity, but also chilled
water and heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we reflect the energy
conservation.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are new buildings that were built
over the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dark line is square footed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Square, gross square feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the quite an increase from
year 2000 to 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is steam sales, flat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Electrical sales, flat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chilled water, flat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Despite a very large increase in our
number of buildings in square footage.
[SPEAKER_07]: This reflects the effort that the
facilities and sustainability office put
[SPEAKER_07]: into this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the carbon neutrality by 2035.
[SPEAKER_07]: Typically, these are driven by financial
reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a quadruple bottom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the solution help Cornell fulfill its
academic mission and purpose?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it meet the needs of the people on
campus and the communities?
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it enhance overall prosperity for the
campus and the region?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it support a sustainable planet?
[SPEAKER_07]: It also includes natural gas and the
leakage issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Solutions for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big one is earth sort heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Digging down about two miles to tap the
warmth and deep rock and using that to in
[SPEAKER_07]: part heat the campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's heat pumps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nuclear was actually considered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we can just buy our way out of this
through offsets.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's looking in the longer term.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a depiction of also called deep
rock geothermal going down 10 to 30,000
[SPEAKER_07]: feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a trivial investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was initially experimental.
[SPEAKER_07]: More short term.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Build more high performance buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Concern energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Switch over as much as possible to
electrical vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Increase our capacity.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this thing called think big,
live green.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is really all of us participating
and doing what we can in our offices and
[SPEAKER_07]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a campus climate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not campus, campus literacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's climate campus literacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally don't think anybody should
graduate from this institution without
[SPEAKER_07]: being fully aware of what climate change
means to their life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a living laboratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this climate literacy is the why we're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's two working groups that are
going to be formed.
[SPEAKER_07]: One focused on climate literacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we incorporate more of that into
experiences for students and our staff and
[SPEAKER_07]: faculty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a group coming together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how do we really change behavior?
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I say group, these are the
faculty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Working with staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: The faculty have the expertise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a personal issue with windows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Open when it's 100 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's pretty close to home.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: One day I walked up to Kennedy and Roberts
Hall and there were 13 windows open.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the AC's running.
[SPEAKER_07]: Helen Newman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the gym.
[SPEAKER_07]: My hair is getting messed up because the
air conditioner is blowing so hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: The door's wide open.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of this stuff, just simple behavior
changes could really make a difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just love to have a group of
students having the opportunity to wander
[SPEAKER_07]: around campus and just start sort of
grading occupants.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are really simple things,
but in fact they're game changers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it possible for the faculty to work
with staff to make these kinds of changes?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Cal's Green that happened in 2011.
[SPEAKER_07]: Energy conservation in several buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: The winner was Barton Lab in Geneva,
but in one year we saved about $230,000 in
[SPEAKER_07]: energy costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two million pounds of CO2.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the simple things.
[SPEAKER_07]: The experiment station, which I was
director of, we adopted a culture of
[SPEAKER_07]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_07]: People were empowered to find better ways
of doing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was actually a sustainable action
team.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things they did on their own
was to reduce the greenhouse footprint by
[SPEAKER_07]: 25,000 square feet, saving a college
$300,000 to $400,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also designed a better growth chamber
that uses 85% less energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's a grand challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can tackle this if we have the will.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look what we've accomplished as a
species.
[SPEAKER_07]: Art, disease, gone to the moon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have these things called iPhones,
technology, agriculture, engineering.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do remarkable things, but we have
to decide we really want to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I challenge all of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get informed, stay informed, accept the
truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making it personal helps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leading is also a good thing, and raise
your voices.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two alums from Cornell, O6 and Tim.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they look back, what are they gonna
do?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they gonna say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't they take action?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we go back to the slide that was on
solutions for the future?
I just didn't register it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the current thoughts about which
one of these solutions would be best?
[SPEAKER_07]: The big one is for source heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, very expensive to install,
et cetera, but it's essentially the heat
[SPEAKER_07]: from the earth is free.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just circulating the gap and
capturing that heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: The solution, bringing it up, and it's hot
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't be steam, but that hot water
then is, instead of the turbo tap,
[SPEAKER_07]: starting with cold water heating it up,
they've already got hot water going.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would also potentially change the
entire heating system on campus from steam
[SPEAKER_07]: to hot water, which would be another
investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that, if it works, and can be
replicated, is a real game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a longer term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people don't realize how
terrible that building is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst building with the highest
energy cost on campus because of any newer
[SPEAKER_03]: air conditioning that comes in goes
directly out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so finally, it's gonna be handled.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the comment I wanted to make is
related to the buildings in general on
[SPEAKER_03]: campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the problem is that when buildings
get upgraded or new buildings get
[SPEAKER_03]: constructed, there is this apparent need
to have platinum lead and to have these
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the cost of the older buildings
that never get a turn to be upgraded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to have all these buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you spend $120 million on one
building, that means that other buildings
[SPEAKER_03]: like Grassland and Emerson stay the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a pretty awful working
environment as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a problem on campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your stance on nuclear energy and
countries like Germany moving away from
[SPEAKER_04]: it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Given the threat of climate change,
I am an advocate for nuclear energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there's also these new breeder
reactors, which are smaller and produce
[SPEAKER_07]: distributed energy production,
which would be a much better direction
[SPEAKER_07]: than I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where James Hanson wrote his book,
Swarming My Grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's essentially his story if we
need to reinvest in newer technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the breeder reactors use existing
nuclear waste as a source of fuel.
Breeder?
Is that what you said?
Breeder?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the deep rock energy prevention,
you said it was a little experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have other larger institutions done it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Spring, a nice one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't have to go very deep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there are some experimental
wells in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the experiment here is they're not
sure how deep they have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I understood one of the graphics that
you showed for climate protection,
[SPEAKER_02]: it shows that this part of the country is
going to have more precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, the temperature is also
increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will drive rapid evaporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the net effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to have more likelihood of
drought events or less?
[SPEAKER_07]: Globally, we're going to get 30-fold
increase in drought events.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand it's not that much here,
but it's just more extremes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, more precipitation, higher
temperatures, and increasing frequency of
[SPEAKER_07]: droughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there are also these increasing
incidences of heavy downpours.
[SPEAKER_07]: More extremes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very low on both sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we really need to focus on
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think sometimes people can get
distracted by the CO2 effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the new calculations show it
doesn't take much CO2 to raise the
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the new calculations coming
up doing spectroscopy analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think even keeping the carbon
neutrality is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this effect could be seen as low as 50
parts per million carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that makes it really scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not going to take much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just any more increase in solar radiation
and our temperatures are going to keep
[SPEAKER_04]: going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't get too distracted by the CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can focus on adaptation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave a talk yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give one tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give one tomorrow, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's another side to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're also seeing more and more
solar and it's contributing more to our
[SPEAKER_07]: electric production.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's hope here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that comes up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually mentioned in the
presentation today called clean coal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you highlight that and what that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it an oxymoron?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being a little fast.
No, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't leave the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's second?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lower sulfur, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the idea is when it's lower sulfur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's some of the other contaminants.
[SPEAKER_07]: But not necessarily CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if I understood you correctly,
you said that the contribution of
[SPEAKER_05]: agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions in
the US is lower than the worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're about 10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Globally it's 18 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that because of the difference in
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that because of other places like
transportation?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in part it's agriculture because
of rice production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody help me out on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, agriculture is a large part of the
GDP for a lot of those countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have also a lot of energy use in
industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably why we're primarily using
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the role of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There isn't so much of it in the actual
change in the agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more that there's just less and less
resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem with those statistics is
there's a lot of embodied energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: embodied greenhouse gas emissions in what
we import.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually our footprint is much larger
than it appears if you just analyze the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions country by country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is disproportionate though.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10% of our GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture is not 10% of our GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much less.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 3% or 4%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still a disproportionate impact
from agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it felt really nice to know we
can all do these small parts to decrease
[SPEAKER_06]: our own energy usage.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we do our small part, then it is
such an insignificant part still.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that we're all operating in this very
high energy environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we justify it because we are working
in things like better climate change
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all working towards some greater
goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what is Cornell University doing as an
institution to systematically change this
[SPEAKER_06]: high energy output?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm trying to share as much as I
could of what Cornell is doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're referring to, on the operations
side.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as an advocacy of the university as an
institution, you're talking to the person
[SPEAKER_06]: at proud.
[SPEAKER_06]: But who else is Cornell talking to?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some major players.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sleaze around this quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just happened to look at some upper
administration positions across the
[SPEAKER_07]: country, provosts being climate change is
not included in this job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have trustees that don't
believe in climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about the Southwest is
going to get drier and agriculture is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be moved to another centralized
somewhere else, I guess I fear that we
[SPEAKER_01]: will just repeat the same issues with
centralized agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll have new energy sources and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll still have this great demand to
move stuff around, fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels like to me, or I guess I
question, are there as many efforts going
[SPEAKER_01]: towards some kind of, I know that it's
happening at a grassroots level to
[SPEAKER_01]: decentralize some of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have this fear that we'll just
move it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_07]: You still have the distribution question,
transportation costs and all that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And energy needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monocultures.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Harold knows the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're in the process of trying to
put together a USDA proposal right now
[SPEAKER_07]: that looks at the Northeast and preparing
for climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has transportation components.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the whole food chain involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try to get them all in the
room, kind of layout scenarios of what
[SPEAKER_07]: it's going to look like in the future and
how do we work together.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very complicated, enormous amounts of
money, a lot of food grown in the wrong
[SPEAKER_07]: places.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you think of global shocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what if California, agriculture does
collapse there in 2060?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that mean globally?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the city in New York City going to
get its food there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I was contacted a while back by
someone.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in New York City trying to find a
consulting group that would come in and
[SPEAKER_07]: help them understand where the food comes
from because of climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of the driver.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get the anthropologists asking
those questions, then we can make some
[SPEAKER_07]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me like some worthwhile work,
too, would just be on the consumer level
[SPEAKER_01]: about this idea of eating locally and not
eating everything every season.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a greenhouse and a poop house
operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to do it centrally.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a corn brain stove and a pellet
stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're selling out of all of our
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So local production, because you can make
it fresh, you can have it taste good so it
[SPEAKER_04]: still tastes all of its flavor and all its
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's done locally, it is a way to
adapt to the climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And market it at lower carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just selling them all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's thank my doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
