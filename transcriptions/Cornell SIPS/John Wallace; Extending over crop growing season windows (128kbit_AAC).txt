[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super jazzed about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of my favorite researchers and
favorite farmers are here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm really looking forward to the rest
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is John Wallace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started at Cornell, and I'm going
to be working in specialty crop systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to talking about how to use
cover crops to suppress weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like I'm just the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really had the pleasure to work with
a host of researchers in the Northeast for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last several years who have been
thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is I'm going to talk about a lot
longer than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important part of this story are the
farmers who are putting these ideas into
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, and several gentlemen who have
provided engineering solutions that have
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed us to use cover crops in new ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also thought it was important to note
that when this group of scientists over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, when we write papers, we typically
end up citing the work of Chuck Moller and
[SPEAKER_00]: John Teasdale, who did a lot of really the
important early work looking at cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and weed interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working off of the assumption that
since you guys are here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be in general agreement
that cover crops are a potential tool in
[SPEAKER_00]: the integrated weed management toolbox,
or one of the many little hammers that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can employ to achieve certain long-term
weed management objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about long-term integrated
weed management, we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining low weed seed banks and annual
cropping systems, and also preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: population spikes, so buffering against
those years when we have poor weed control
[SPEAKER_00]: and really high weed seed rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what we want to do with an
integrated weed management approach is to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent weeds that become adapted to our
system, so adapted weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a little bit about the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mechanisms by which cover crops
suppress weeds and disrupt weed life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we're talking about a living cover
or surface mulch residue, we know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops can affect what's going on in
the weed seed bank by alternating
[SPEAKER_00]: germination cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light quality, changes in soil
temperature, soil moisture that trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seed germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops can also enhance habitat for
seed predators, so granivores that can
[SPEAKER_00]: also help drive down weed seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some evidence that cover
crops influence microbial diversity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, and that diversity can contribute to
greater weed seed decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then above ground, we know that a living
cover through competition or the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch through physical interference can
preempt resources away from weeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: influence by altering soil moisture
dynamics, nitrogen availability,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing competition for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things can contribute to either
mortality of emerged weeds or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing the amount of seed rain in
annual cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity by which cover crops
influence those weed life cycles is really
[SPEAKER_00]: a function of certain life history traits
of weeds, and as well where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: employing cover crops within a rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're thinking about business as usual,
where we're using cover crops in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder seasons within an annual crop
rotation, we're very likely to have pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic effects on winter annual weeds
like marestail that germinate in the fall
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the spring, but we may kind of have
marginal effects on summer annual weed
[SPEAKER_00]: species, so we might prevent some weed
seed germination for early emerging summer
[SPEAKER_00]: annuals, but for summer annuals that have
peak emergence periods in crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a summer annual crop, cover crops
likely have pretty marginal effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: weed dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the two extremes, when we're in an
annual crop rotation, say in a full
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage organic system or in a continuous
no-till conventional system, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on either these big hammers,
tillage, or multiple passes of herbicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're very likely to be still selecting
for adapted weed species in those systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cover crops may have a marginal
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to talk about today is
opportunities for making cover crops a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger hammer in the integrated weed
management toolbox in conservation tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, both organic and conventional
systems, by moving cover crops closer or
[SPEAKER_00]: into summer annual crop rotations,
and so the two common things going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there are the need to move away from kind
of business as usual and either
[SPEAKER_00]: terminating a cover crop with herbicides
or tillage early and delaying termination
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow cover crops to get big and then
relying on surface mulch residue for
[SPEAKER_00]: increased weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working, we know quite a bit
about using this kind of high residue
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop mulch system in organic
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Northeast, there's been probably
over a decade of research looking at this
[SPEAKER_00]: system in what we would call a cover crop
based organic rotational no-till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to do is just touch on
how that system works, what we've learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if we can take what we've learned
from that system and start to employ that
[SPEAKER_00]: in more of a conventional, continuous
no-till system to really make cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: a bigger tool in the integrated weed
management toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we employ this system both in a no-till
corn or a no-till soybean phase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation, and I'm just going to use for
example a no-till soybean system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular system, many of you
are going to be familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to grow a big cover crop,
and so we really prioritize optimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that cover crop established in
front of soybeans who are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting that cover crop in early
at a high seeding rate with the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a big cover, and we're terminating
cereal rye at flowering, at thesis with a
[SPEAKER_00]: roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're no-till planting soybeans
directly into that mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's critical is this trade-off of
when we're doing minimal kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance at planting in row,
we do a better job of suppressing weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we consistently see a trade-off where
sometimes it's harder to get a good crop
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment when we're planting into
that big residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not always going to get the
biomass that we think we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically in that system, we think we
probably need about three tons of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter biomass to get a really good
bead-suppressive mulch when we terminate
[SPEAKER_00]: the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been thinking about
integrated weed management approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we've been integrating the use of a
high-residue cultivator in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way that works is there's these
high-residue sweeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 20 inches wide, and they
don't invert the soil, so they kill weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: by actually severing the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that allows you to go in later than
what we would typically use inter-row
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have found is two passes about
four or five weeks after planting
[SPEAKER_00]: generally optimizes in-row weed control
when we integrate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high-residue cultivator into the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some data from a long-term
organic cropping systems experiment that's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these rotational no-till
approaches at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some data from Rebecca Champagne,
who's a master's student there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this cropping systems experiment
at Penn State, we're comparing full
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage soybean production with this
rotation rotational no-till approach using
[SPEAKER_00]: the cover crops and the roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this data is late-season weed
biomass for three different crop years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed biomass is broken down by
in-row weeds and then between-row weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the x-axis, you can also see the
number of cultivation passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the full tillage system,
we're using blind cultivation or inter-row
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation somewhere between three or six
times a year, depending on weather
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of adaptively using
high-residue cultivation in the no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here what kind of biomass
we were getting with the cereal rye cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this data, what have we
really learned about the viability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that if you look across the
rotation, we're seeing pretty comparable
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of weed suppression between the
no-till approach and the full tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also are seeing that both of these
types of systems are pretty vulnerable to
[SPEAKER_00]: weed control failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those weed control failures happen are
primarily a function of weed control
[SPEAKER_00]: failures in row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2016, in the full tillage,
right after planting, we stayed wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get it into blind cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it dried up, we couldn't get
those weeds out of the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is a little bit different in the
no-till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that system, we had a pretty high
weed seed bank inputs in 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a challenging year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the in-row weeds are probably due to
too much soil disturbance at planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also finding that,
which I think is important because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the original work was really thinking
about driving up cereal rye biomass to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a better weed suppressive mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that from year to year,
weed control is not really a function of
[SPEAKER_00]: how much cereal rye biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is the ability to have
this integrated approach where we use
[SPEAKER_00]: high-residue cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm not showing is the weed
species breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I did, what you would see is both
of these systems are pretty vulnerable to
[SPEAKER_00]: species becoming adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in each year, the proportion of total
weeds, we saw giant foxtail become more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more dominant in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just another data point that
suggests that we need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated approaches within season and
across rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to really manage weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the opportunities for thinking
about using this high-residue surface
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch approach in continuous conventional
no-till systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that have made this
approach more conceivable is this small
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an integrated roller-cripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a ZRX, Zone Residue Manager
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Biologic sells it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fabricated by a Pennsylvania
no-till farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this allows you to do is to roll
and plant in one pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can mount these on the frame ahead
of your no-till planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would be a slicing residue behind
here followed by a little by the no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: planter units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also allows you to be a little more
aggressive with these double-disc row
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaners in row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we're using herbicides in this
system, we can be a little more aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that we're establishing a
good crop and use herbicides to control
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds in the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been trying to think about
how this approach is going to influence
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide programs or the use of
herbicides in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a couple of things going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, when we're using the roller-cripper
approach in a conventional system,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a lot more flexibility in when we
terminate the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important because it's
not really just how much biomass you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, but we're consistently challenged
by weather conditions when you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the field and terminate a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to use burned down
herbicides allow us a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility in managing the cover crop
residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we like to think is that by
moving to this kind of higher residue
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch approach, we have the opportunities
to reduce the amount of residual
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides or post-herbicides that we're
going to rely on in a continuous no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really critical given that
Northeast is now seeing the introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: of more and more glyphosate resistant
weeds in our no-till cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thinking broadly about this,
we're thinking that adopting this approach
[SPEAKER_00]: of these higher residue mulch systems in
continuous no-till is potentially critical
[SPEAKER_00]: enough where we're thinking about
preserving conservation tillage systems by
[SPEAKER_00]: diversifying our weed management approach,
which allows us to preserve effective
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that by preventing the evolution
of herbicide resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's going to happen,
we really think that what's necessary is
[SPEAKER_00]: for cover crops and herbicide programs to
be complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we're thinking about
complementarity between herbicides and
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops, we're thinking about three
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we're thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cover crops are complementary,
if at the time of a herbicide application,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're spraying fewer weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we're spraying fewer weeds,
we're moving selection pressure away from
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that mortality pressure is coming from
the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also complementary if we're
reducing weed size at the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extension weed scientists everywhere
always talk about the finger rule or the
[SPEAKER_00]: soda can rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that killing weeds with herbicides is
about dose response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if weeds are smaller, one drop of a
herbicide is going to be more effective
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, if we're spraying
smaller weeds and we're spraying through a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop, there's the potential for
interference from the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may potentially reduce herbicide
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show some data that
kind of looks at this complementarity
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a marestail example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marestail is a winter annual weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the poster child for
glyphosate resistant weeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the selection pressure is occurring
at burndown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we would like to see is to
spray fewer marestail plants at burndown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this data shows is across four
different years, this is a marestail
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black lines are no cover crop plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green lines are where we had a cereal
rye cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in three out of four
years, the potential for reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of weeds that we're spraying,
removing selection pressure away from
[SPEAKER_00]: those herbicides, is potentially greater
than 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really positive outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how big were those horseweed plants
when we were using a burndown herbicide to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the top, this is two different
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the top is with a no cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom is with cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that when we don't have
the cover, we're increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: probability of violating the soda can
rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're spraying bigger weeds when we
don't have the cover crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do have the cover crop,
we've really constrained weed size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're spraying smaller weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is some data from Jess
Bunchek, who is working on this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: interference, so the potential for cover
crops to interfere with the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is, here this is herbicide
spray coverage at the time of a burndown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide application, this is the amount
of ground cover that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see the control, cereal rye,
and a rye Harry Betch cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that as you increase
ground cover with a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: the deposition of the herbicide goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is potential negative
trade-off associated with using cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, so I have pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was using spray cards to actually
measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the herbicide deposition in a no
cover crop plot and a Harry Betch cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: rye cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a couple more slides?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's kind of winter
annuals, where we really have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to really drive weed suppression
or increase weed suppression with cover
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about those summer annual weeds
that have peak emergence periods in crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly late emerging weeds like
pigweed species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how much weed suppression can we
get out of that surface mulch residue?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a data set from the same
set of experiments where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: pigweed density at the time of a
post-emergent application, so about three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an x-axis of cereal rye
biomass at burndown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have no cover crop plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cereal rye plots where we
terminated at the boot stage and then
[SPEAKER_00]: where we terminated at the heading stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that increasing the amount
of biomass prior to termination increases
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while compared to horseweed,
it may be a more marginal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still driving down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still increasing weed suppression on
those summer annual weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same idea with what are we doing to weed
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably not as demonstrable as kind of
the horseweed data, but we're still seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we have the surface mulch
residue there, we have fewer weeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting big at the time of a
post-emergent application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're probably slightly more probable
to violate the finger rule or the soda can
[SPEAKER_00]: rule in the no cover crop control.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so just to wrap things up,
I would like to think from this data that
[SPEAKER_00]: the question of can we make cover crops a
bigger tool in the toolbox and an
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated weed management approach by
moving to this high residue surface mulch,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a lot of signs that this could be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also didn't talk about all the
potential agronomic trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the weed suppression
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we want to move forward and make
this something that is really viable,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still some challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the organic system, in the
organic no-till system, I think one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical challenges is just getting these
consistent crop stands while minimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: inroad disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that might be just a technological
fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conventional systems, we still have all
these question marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about this interference question,
trade-offs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we adding additional pest pressure
other than weeds, yield drags due to
[SPEAKER_00]: shortened seasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are important questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked solely about cereal rye alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk about mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start thinking about
integrating cover crop mixtures into the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, we may be able to add wheat,
have greater weed suppression,
[SPEAKER_00]: but probably increase the complexity of
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this approach requires
investments in capital and new equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that investment really worth
long-term conservation benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I hope I have time for a couple
questions or comments.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The no-till approach versus the?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, so totally different cultivation
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the no-till systems, we're using
that high residue sweep, so one sweep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the full tillage system,
we would be using blind cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so either a tiny weed or a road or a
harrow, and then just inter-row
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
Thank you.
