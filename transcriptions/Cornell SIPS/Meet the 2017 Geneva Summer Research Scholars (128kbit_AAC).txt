[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Larry Smart, Professor of
Horticulture and Director of the Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: Geneva Summer Research Scholars Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a sophomore or junior
undergraduate and are passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: plant breeding, horticulture, entomology,
or plant pathology, and want to get more
[SPEAKER_02]: experience in research, listen to the
comments of our previous summer scholars
[SPEAKER_02]: and consider applying to our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to this, I had sort of planned to go
to graduate school to study more medical
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology, and that's what most of my
previous research has been centered
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the course of this program,
I've gotten to really, really enjoy plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology, and a lot of the opportunities
here have opened my eyes to different
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives and this whole new sort of
world of microbiology that I haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to explore previously.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was interested because it had a field
aspect that I really wanted to get more
[SPEAKER_06]: experience in, and I was very lucky enough
to be able to go outside every single day,
[SPEAKER_06]: rain or shine, hanging out in the apple
orchard, and that really pushed me and I
[SPEAKER_06]: really found my passion for outdoor
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm able to just come to work,
learn what I need to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with long-read DNA sequencing,
and this program has really made me think
[SPEAKER_03]: whether I want to do bioinformatics,
whether I want to go into agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: medical, it makes me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited when I found out about
this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my work is pretty self-directed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go out in the field and collect
insects and work on entomology that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this experience, I was much more
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a lot of work with genetics
and PCR, which wasn't something I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really great to learn that
hands-on sort of approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I was thinking of going to
public health school after I graduated,
[SPEAKER_05]: but this program has made me seriously
consider coming to Cornell or pursuing
[SPEAKER_05]: plant science as a career, and I'm really
excited for where that path takes me,
[SPEAKER_05]: and this program has been great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also got to meet and interact with a lot
of researchers and other professors that
[SPEAKER_08]: are top-notch in the field on what they
study, and they've truly showed me a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of how the research can be applied to the
real world in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone I worked with was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it a lot by myself,
but my grad student and PI were just
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal and the coolest people I've
ever met.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a great experience for me because
I was able to study both the entomological
[SPEAKER_04]: side of things as well as the plant
pathological side of things, and this was
[SPEAKER_04]: like an all-new experience for me,
but it was very rewarding to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: work independently but also with a lot of
support and guidance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a summer scholar in 2014,
and before I came here, I actually didn't
[SPEAKER_09]: even know what plant pathology was,
and I was on a pre-med track earlier in
[SPEAKER_09]: undergrad, but decided that wasn't
something that was for me, and so I came
[SPEAKER_09]: here with kind of a blank slate of knowing
that I was interested in science,
[SPEAKER_09]: but didn't know exactly what direction I
wanted to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great support network in all the
other summer scholars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's talking about your research
or trying to figure out better ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: word things or just chilling and relaxing
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really fun to come here with about
30 other people that are around the same
[SPEAKER_06]: age as you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the same interests as you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys can do really funny nerd jokes,
like plant jokes to each other,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geneva is a great place to spend your
summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of fun activities to do on
the weekends.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lake is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: The station is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone is so welcoming, and it's been a
great experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've tried all the restaurants here,
and we've gone to Rochester a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are cities close by, and hanging out
with these guys is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You make a lot of friends in the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our program has a long track record of
propelling students into graduate school
[SPEAKER_02]: or professional careers in the
agricultural sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you've heard that you'll have a
great time here in the Finger Lakes,
[SPEAKER_02]: so please apply and join us at Cornell.

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
