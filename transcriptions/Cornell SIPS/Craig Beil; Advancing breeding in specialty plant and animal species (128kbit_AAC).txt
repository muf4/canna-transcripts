[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm with Breeding Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just up Tower Road next to the Boyce
Thompson Institute in a small building
[SPEAKER_00]: that you probably haven't noticed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're on campus if you're looking for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, super excited to share the work
that the team does at Breeding Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Borrowed a lot of slides from people,
and we'll get to talk through these
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overview, definitely spend a little bit
of time explaining what Breeding Insight
[SPEAKER_00]: is, why we were founded, what we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into some specific examples of genomics
projects and how we're assisting breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about some bioinformatics results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about some of the image
analysis projects that we've worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: with breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about DeltaBread,
which is our database management platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a couple miscellaneous
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Breeding Insight, the mission that we
were given was to help transform breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: by enabling the implementation of genomic
insight and selection as part of routine
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty crop and livestock breeding
across all of USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what people at USDA ARS were
seeing and what we've discovered working
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of specialty species is that a
lot of the challenges in corn and soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the tools and items that have
been deployed aren't readily transferable
[SPEAKER_00]: to specialty species in a one-to-one
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this list kind of shows that
with corn and soybean, you've got very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, full mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking just at two annual species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got functional diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to deal with seed components,
seed planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of commercial breeders are in this
space, primarily focused on high yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get to have dry harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to transfer that list over to
Blueberry and lettuce, it falls apart
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, how do we create tools?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we adapt these tools and service
breeders when this is not the conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: list of things that have been made for
corn and soybean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeders that we work with,
breeders are tasked and asked to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have a successful program to make
good progress, you've got to have good
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program management, a lot of good
field data collection tools, store your
[SPEAKER_00]: traits properly, manage all your samples,
whether that's DNA samples, tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, seed samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, can you work within the USDA
germplasm banks to bring in new and novel
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity, identify new traits
that are plaguing your growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: storing your genetic data, perform genetic
analyses, and then make all those
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions and report out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeding's not a sole enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any single person can do all
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're really looking at doing is
how can you create a good team?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think any breeder today would say,
I would love to have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformaticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have somebody who's
knowledgeable of genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have a good statistician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'd like to have a software
developer to help connect and build new
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to serve my program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to provide this for every species,
for every breeder across USDA ARS would be
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely challenging and extremely cost
prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where breeding insight kind of fits
within this scheme, again, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of basic research that comes out,
super new techniques, new research coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant and animal breeders, as I just
showed on the list before, they're tasked
[SPEAKER_00]: with a whole bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't always have time to go figure
out the newest software, figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: newest genomic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to disrupt their current
workflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we kind of fit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is kind of looking over at the basic
research, hearing directly from plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: animal breeders what are their needs,
what are their challenges, and help ease
[SPEAKER_00]: that technology adoption into their
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they say, I want to start using
genetic markers in my program,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what you want to use them
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many do you want to deploy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's show you a suite of
genomic tools that might be a good fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just kind of narrow down the search
space for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not wasting your time chasing a
bunch of different things that disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: your current workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give you a really high probability
of success for what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so a little bit more about who
we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we are a USDA ARIS funded
initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are Cornell employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really nice at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We connect and build resources for
specialty crop and livestock breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk examples for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I just mentioned, we really picture
ourselves as a service and technology
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just helping provide additional
support to USDA specialty breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'll focus a lot on science
team developments, but want to highlight
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're a team made up of scientists as
well as software developers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so a little bit about what our
growth has been like since 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of starting Breeding Insight
and the inception came in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our first group of species in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the six species, trout,
salmon, alfalfa grape, blueberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sweet potato that represented about 15
breeding programs across the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2022, we got 10 new species pictured
down at the bottom and also the formation
[SPEAKER_00]: of Breeding Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a group doing similar work to
what we're doing, but they're primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: focused down in the Southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a slightly different
research model than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2024, we got 11 new species pictured on
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings us up to supporting around
51 breeders and breeding programs across
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of what it looks like where
all those breeding programs are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we've got some high
capacity over in the Pacific Northwest in
[SPEAKER_00]: Corvallis, Oregon, as well as Prosser,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also quite a bit of capacity in Madison,
Wisconsin, a number of species there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a decent number in Belt,
Asheville, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the idea is build some capacity
at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can serve as kind of surge
support for bioinformatics, genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping, software development to these
breeding programs across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's really fun with
working with all these different species
[SPEAKER_00]: is we'll hear of a solution or a challenge
in something like trout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll hear a similar thing in
cranberry and take a tool from trout and
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to apply it in cranberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two groups would never meet at a
typical conference or discuss these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sit at kind of an interesting spot,
hearing a lot of just breeding technology
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we help funnel and distribute that
information out to other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was a little bit about
breeding insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the other things
that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big challenges that we were
set out to do with looking at our species
[SPEAKER_00]: portfolio is we can't constantly be
building one-off solutions for every
[SPEAKER_00]: species or every program that we work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking with breeders, working with
breeders, a lot of the challenges are the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to figure out what is a common
solution that's going to work across all
[SPEAKER_00]: those species is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're making good progress
identifying a number of tools and services
[SPEAKER_00]: that work in that capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what we refer to this as kind of
creating species agnostic tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we identify something that can help
breeders perform their own bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of the ploidy level of the
species, regardless of the marker platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: If a species says they want to use
genotyping, can we find one good
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping provider that can fit the needs
for all the species that we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we find something that works on
berries and also works on leaves and also
[SPEAKER_00]: works on roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of simpler solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the database management,
that's the same component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we find a way for breeders to store
data for annuals as well as perennials for
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are at the plot level,
things are at the plant level?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just really try to create species
agnostic tools across all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go into some specific genotyping
services, tools, and projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I talked about,
the challenges with genetics, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the species that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going all the way from a haploid
diploid system in honeybee through a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of diploids with some of them having sex
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've also got some in fish
breeding, they will change the sexes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fish periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can look across our
polyploid species, we've got tetraploids
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to 12X species and not
always 12X, sometimes other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as we keep looking at this
stuff, it keeps getting more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets more complicated, and some people
say more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some additional challenges with
polyploids is that you usually don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a high quality reference genome due to the
complexity of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get accurate dosage calling,
and it's hard to face the markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for polyploid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the challenges that
we're facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of that species agnostic tool that
I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've identified DART, Diversity Array
Technology, as a company in Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: that's working really well to fit a lot of
the needs and requests that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our current model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the marker technology from
them on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But breeders that come to us and say they
want to do genotyping will work with them
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a species-specific marker panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the breeders in this equation are
there doing the tissue collection on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with them to provide best
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the plastic where they need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they ship it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much to collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they working with?
[SPEAKER_00]: We help them with the shipping to
Australia, which, again, they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: strict borders for bringing in outside
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA extraction is also done at DART.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about $2 a sample, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual genotyping, depending on
the species, $9 to $11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty low cost, pretty high
throughput.
[SPEAKER_00]: DART's been great to work with,
and that genotyping data can come directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can help the breeders QC the data
and perform any early bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can push that back to them,
and then they can make direct breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions with the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little bit about the DART tag is
the technology that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a targeted genotyping by
sequencing platform based on this padlock
[SPEAKER_00]: technology featured on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can target any SNP or small indel
into the DART tag panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we're making the marker panels
to target 3,000 loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's within a single primer pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's nice about this technology is
that we're allowed to force in any major
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL or markers used in marker-assisted
selection that the breeders are already
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated into their breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can force those in, and then we try
to round out the rest of the panel with
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-wide distribution of the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hitting the same 3,000 loci every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get relatively low missing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that this works plenty well
for any genetic maps that we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: create, any QTL analysis, any GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting good genomic prediction
accuracies for most of our species,
[SPEAKER_00]: for most traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've been busy making a lot of
marker panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the list of species that we
currently have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with DART to make these marker
panels open source and publicly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're an alfalfa breeder,
you can contact DART and use the same
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa marker panel, whether you're an
industry or whether you're USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that data has a one-to-one comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so here's a number of species that
we've worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the ones that are currently in
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll have a new hop marker panel
coming out, watermelon, red clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp's being worked on with the group up
in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got blackberry being worked on
on the position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just to reiterate, what we've
seen with the DART tag marker technology
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we found it to be readily
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get good communication with DART.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders are also able to easily send
their samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data coming back is highly reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting fast turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price point's quite affordable,
high repeatability among the calls that
[SPEAKER_00]: are being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like that it's a targeted marker
platform, that you're hitting the same
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about the data that you
get when it comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that you get targeted
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're targeting a SNP of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at this G to A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's targeted sequencing,
right now at 81 base pairs, we'll also
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up these off-target SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're calling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for any loci, we're getting additional
what we're calling microhaplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just bioallelic SNP calls at
the locus, we're getting much more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more similar to SSR markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some additional information on why we
like DART tag for genotyping for the
[SPEAKER_00]: species that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same set of loci across all
projects and samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just makes sharing information,
particularly when there's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs for a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well on low-quality DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get low-missing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get pretty good read depth at around 50
reads per locus per sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really helps with multi-state
dosage calling, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: autopolyploid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like the multi-allelic reads,
what we call microhaplotypes, across the
[SPEAKER_00]: target loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, linkage maps constructed
using DART SNPs can identify some genome
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen this in cranberry and
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting multiple microhaplotypes per
locus means we've got a whole lot of loci
[SPEAKER_00]: and a whole lot of genetic data that we
need to keep track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some examples in alfalfa on the
upper left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we were just looking at
bioallelic SNPs at 3,000 loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would expect to see 6,000 alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're identifying 32,000 unique
microhaplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming at around 10 microhaplotypes per
locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of additional
information at those loci that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep track of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to work with our breeders,
keep genotyping a number of samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we can get kind of, where do these
stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much can we capture enough diversity
with a single marker panel that these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of asymptote?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can say, yeah, we feel like we've
identified 95% of the genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: for the loci that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across the seven species that we've
currently got marker panels out for,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got 156,000 microhaplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk next about setting up
databases to keep track of this
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, so here's the target SNPs,
the off-target SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're working to establish the
best workflows for filtering and
[SPEAKER_00]: processing this genotype data as it comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to create file formats that work
with other applications for downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want breeders to have flexibility if
they want to use tools that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: developing in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get them the data file formats that
they can go run their regular analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've already set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then we're trying to create and
test internal apps for user-friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on something called
haplotype DB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a picture of a component of that
haplotype DB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called haplosearch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows you to query those
microhaplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look at a particular
locus to see how many microhaplotypes you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, or if you've identified a
microhaplotype associated with a major
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL, you can go in, look further into that
allele, a microhaplotype, and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: other germplasm that might have that same
allele or QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can also look across projects and
say, I'm only seeing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity at this one loci that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing a lot of other projects have a
whole lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should reach out to my
collaborator and ask for some germplasms
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of diversity in this
targeted region.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we'll shift to bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa creeping rootedness QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeder that we were working with
had identified this as kind of classic
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa, kind of staying within its
planted row very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very interested in what's going on
with this spreading alfalfa that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: identified, thinking that maybe this would
lead to increased tolerance for biotic or
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic stresses, or maybe there could be
a niche market for growers who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant this and just let the alfalfa spread
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we genotyped an alfalfa population,
segregating for the trait using the 3K
[SPEAKER_00]: DARTAG marker panel for alfalfa,
performed GWAS poly within this big app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we identified a major QTL on
chromosome 6, explaining this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can share that back to the breeder
and see what he wants to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next project, genomic
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick with alfalfa here for
another minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alfalfa, when we started working with
them a few years ago, they really weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: using a lot of genetic tools in their
analyses or in their breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that they have a marker panel,
they're very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're talking about moving into
genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of in the testing phase right
now, like what accuracies are we getting
[SPEAKER_00]: for our traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we create a training panel to do
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're working with them to show
what's the diversity with what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with with their training group?
[SPEAKER_00]: What percentages do you need from all
these different subgroups to get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions that you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, again, a lot of other species,
plenty of literature on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa is just coming to the table now,
trying to assist them with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that we're getting pretty
good prediction accuracies for things like
[SPEAKER_00]: height in their program.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talked a lot about microhaplotypes,
having these multiple information per
[SPEAKER_00]: loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about, can we squeeze more
information using that data than just
[SPEAKER_00]: biallelic SNPs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of genomic prediction
accuracies can we get if we actually use
[SPEAKER_00]: the microhaplotypes for pedigree
relatedness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus just the biallelic target SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing slight increases in there,
and we're really interested in exploring
[SPEAKER_00]: that more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I just alluded to this big
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that stands for the Breeding Insight
Genomics app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a collaboration with the
genomics and bioinformatics team,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as other key people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to make it our shiny app,
just to make a web-based application to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform genomics and bioinformatics
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody can use it with no coding
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got really good integrated help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on putting out tutorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's help pages online.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also clickable information within
the app to find more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, you can feel confident
running your own analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, if you use the tool,
you've got the citations for what tools
[SPEAKER_00]: and additional applications were
incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, broad support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the ability to pick what ploidy
your species is within the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diploids, polyploids, should be able to
use the tool without any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the basic analyses in there are,
again, we can do dosage calling from the
[SPEAKER_00]: files coming from DART.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at your data using PCAs,
do some basic genetic diversity analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can perform GWAS, and you can do
genomic prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk image phenotyping
tools that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a Sweet Potato NEMA toad
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one was with the Sweet Potato
group down in Charleston, South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were doing root washes of potatoes
to look for which ones are most resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: or most susceptible to nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classic model was to dilute these root
washes, sit at the microscope for three
[SPEAKER_00]: plus weeks, hand counting the nematodes on
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seemed fairly inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reached out to us, could we come up
with a better solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tears in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was our first application of
doing machine learning for image analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see on this slide, there's
still a lot of plant debris, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: picking up the nematode eggs very clearly
from that plant debris in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking down here at the F1 scores,
so the models agree more with humans per
[SPEAKER_00]: counts than one human to another human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scalability of this, again,
going from single slides to now you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pipette 96 samples into a plate and then
run it through the machine and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: images really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next one, this was the
trout image one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we've got Edwin online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got AJ in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this came from the trout breeder in
Hagerman, Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was really interested in taking
images of the trout eggs following
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization to identify which ones had
successful fertilization versus which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: were blank or aborted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the differences with your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial challenge was that the eggs
are quite glossy and shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to come up with an imaging
system to reduce that glare on those to
[SPEAKER_00]: get clear images so we could actually
categorize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the efficiency is that these trays with
the eggs sometimes have up to 7,000 eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this machine learning model will
analyze it within seconds with minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recording over 95% accuracy on dead versus
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the scalability is that they worked
very nicely to create this very simple
[SPEAKER_00]: light box and deploy that in a system that
needs to stay dry, can't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: handling, and just needs to be readily
deployed on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the final one for image
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was potato growth defects with boja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this came out of the Max Feldman's
potato breeding group in Prosser,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he asked, can we segment and measure
negative growth traits on potato tubers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So his system is that he can harvest them,
wash them, put them on a conveyor belt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they get automatically imaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the potatoes are cropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted to identify some negative
growth traits, like this growth crack on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tuber, and then also these sprouts
that are on the tuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the efficiency is hundreds to
thousands of tubers can be individually
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated in an automated run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting 90% to 94% accuracy,
where this is now replacing the classic 1
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5 rating for negative growth defects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about the data
management software called Delta Breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're definitely trying to abide by
fair data practices, so make the data
[SPEAKER_00]: easily findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to adhere to the community
standards set by BRAPPI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the breeding application
programming interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk extensively with Pete Selby on
that type of work and try to stay up to
[SPEAKER_00]: date and help provide information back to
the community when we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the big challenge is creating
things that are general but also can be
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to breeding programs at the same
time, as we're trying to manage a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've recently released the Delta Breed
version 1.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're considering this our MVP,
or minimal viable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we know that we're working
with pretty basic features, kind of data
[SPEAKER_00]: in, data out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's known limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the moment, we're trying to have a
controlled rollout to our breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really just trying to support the
USDA ARS breeders that are most engaged
[SPEAKER_00]: with us and have the most immediate need
for data management support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that, again, just try to really
help get documentation and training
[SPEAKER_00]: resources in place so that they can do
additional learning and know best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, some things that the system
can do at the moment is we can set privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: and administration levels for each user
within the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can upload germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can upload ontology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the traits that you're going to
phenotype with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can upload experiments and observation
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got the BRAPI connection to
push data to field book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, users sign in using their ORC ID
so that your user permission level is
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of germplasm records.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that comes in gets a unique
GID, the name of the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can track the pedigree
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always open and expand to see
more details on that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedigree viewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a BRAPI coming out of the
breed base group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was an example of Zuni.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a pecan release down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to track back and see what
were the parents and how did they get to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ontology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, phenotypes, ontology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the set vocabulary?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the vocabulary that you're using to
go and collect phenotypes out in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a shortened name here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can include the full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the trait that you're measuring?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the scale class?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the units that you're working with?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click Show More Details,
you get a little bit more information for
[SPEAKER_00]: what are each of the values that you've
set, one to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the idea is that you're
providing enough information that if I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave this to somebody to go out to the
field to score, that you would feel
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that they could go score
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to invert the scales or
invent something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something as simple as plant
height is, well, am I measuring it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I measuring it in the end of the
season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I measuring it at the top of the
flower, to the flag leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just being very clear on what's the
defined vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we come in with the trait
method and scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiments and observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think pretty classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your germplasm name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the GID.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's associated with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a test plot or a check plot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What environment are you working in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your row and column positions for
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set lat and long if you're using a
GPS to track where those are in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: A unique observation unit ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is system-wide for that data row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fill in and upload your phenotype
data for the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then downloading data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can decide, am I calling all
environments associated with that
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the file format that I would
like my data to come out in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the connection to Fieldbook via BRAPi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has worked nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a QR code on the screen for your
breeding program, which will push the data
[SPEAKER_00]: into Fieldbook so that you can indicate
which field you want to go collect data
[SPEAKER_00]: for and upload your phenotype traits as
well and select those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can go out in the field and
digitally collect your phenotype data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully minimal downloading of files
and re-uploading the files.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just scan the QR code and push
that using BRAPi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an important component not to be missed
in creating all of these tools is also the
[SPEAKER_00]: training that needs to go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a learning hub online so that
people can go and find this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can create links, provide SOPs,
plenty of Zoom instructions, plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings with breeders to hear what are
the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we better help?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we can, we love to go out and
have in-person site visits with our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders to really hear firsthand what are
they faced with and establish a good
[SPEAKER_00]: connection with our collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional software demo applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got YouTube videos coming in
pretty consistently now to help talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the DeltaBread software, the big app,
and other tools that we're developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I think we've made it almost to the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple fun, miscellaneous things to
finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a long list of species that we
work with at Breeding Insight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also just taking a look at what CALS
already works with and Agritech up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 50% overlap between these
groups and the species that we support.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have our own set of species
that aren't common between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think we hope that there's
tools and services at Breeding Insight and
[SPEAKER_00]: that these can be transferred over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for your time,
and I look forward to the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just also want to take a moment to
highlight that Breeding Insight and BI
[SPEAKER_00]: OnRamp received the 2024 USDA Secretary
Honor Award.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was, I think, category four for
providing all-American safe and nutritious
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was on January 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dong Yan got to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Reinhart is our PI representing the
Office of National Programs at the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Keo is with BI OnRamp, so they got to
go down and enjoy the celebration with Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: as he won this award.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to highlight a number of
Cornell-trained individuals on our team
[SPEAKER_00]: who were trained at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to the people who helped
train these great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have them back in the Cornell
community, providing more tools and
[SPEAKER_00]: services and sticking their whole careers
with plant breeding and genetics or
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's a pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely a lot of people to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ton of support at the BI OnRamp
staff, the O&P, a lot of people on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding Insight team at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to our advisory board for
helping answer questions when we have
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
