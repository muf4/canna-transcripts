[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about photosynthesis
much, but I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic organisms and their
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to talk about is this
business, this yin and the yang that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have known for the longest time,
which is that there are cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: like cyanobacterial cells, that can
perform these two amazing and important
[SPEAKER_00]: energy-related processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One producing energy and the other one
utilizing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's photosynthetic and
photosynthetic nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just start by saying something
that probably everybody in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the basis for this study is
that photosynthesis, especially oxygenic
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, produces oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen fixation depends on an enzyme
that's exquisitely sensitive to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the two things happen in the
same space in the same time or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: this has been a long time question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question that people have been
asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I will tell you now is what we
have learned over the last 15 years or so
[SPEAKER_00]: studying specialized cyanobacterial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite slide always to remind
myself and also when I teach students is
[SPEAKER_00]: that oxygenic photosynthetic
photosynthesis, nature devised this
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing system a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's carbon negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces the byproduct oxygen that we
all depend on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these carbohydrates, that's the basis
for life as we know on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I want to point
out is that the basic machinery for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis evolved in cyanobacteria as
far as oxygenic photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned and remained the same over many
millions of years or billions of years of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that what we see in plants systems,
the basic machinery of photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: remains the same as what evolved into a
cyanobacterial system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are cyanobacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am assuming that majority of the folks
here are plant biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cyanobacteria are microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are prokaryotes, oxygenic
photosynthetic prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the progenitors of chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most abundant fossils in Precambrian rock
have been around for many billion years
[SPEAKER_00]: and found everywhere on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to be important today is
this feature that they are the only known
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria with circadian lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will play an important role in
what I'm going to discuss today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cyanobacteria, I'm just going to quote
Steve Engelgold's book of life from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that the 2.5 to 2 billion years
ago cyanobacteria thrived by using water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most abundant source of hydrogen in
the environment and oxygen was a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is the important sentence,
life began to change the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The planet the way we know it,
the oxic environment, primarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacteria responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the consequence was this business
of all iron 2 plus becoming iron 3 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitated to the ocean bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically for biology, this is a big
conundrum because the basic machinery of
[SPEAKER_00]: life was dependent on iron 2 plus but then
all of a sudden we don't have any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody including human beings,
we have to invent all sorts of ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: capturing iron and using it at the
appropriate level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nearly over a billion years
oxygen level built up, dissolved in water,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kept in the atmosphere 20.6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was even higher and stage was
set for the evolution of eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without this, this probably would not have
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gold says tiny organisms that exploited
the wealth of CO2, water and sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like this, wide variety of
habitats, they're morphologically diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: and some can also fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I show here, those are supposed to be
micron, that's the Mac to PC conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be very large like 10 micron
bacterial cells and unicellular,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas these they can also be in
filamentous phase like in Anabena,
[SPEAKER_00]: a system that has been studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three in the bottom are the one that
can fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinicocyst is 6803, that's a workhorse
that we have been working on for more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not know how to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to compare this one with that
one, cyanotc 51142 and 6803, those two
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers that will come up over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one cannot fix nitrogen, this one
can, but both of those are photosynthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go into cyanotc.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to describe to you is a
project that has been ongoing for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 15 years now with this class of
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me go back and point out
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nitrogen fixation takes place in a
photosynthetic organism, as I pointed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: one has to separate out the two processes,
the process of oxygen production and the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of nitrogen fixation, because the
two are the young and the young,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now organisms have developed two different
strategies to do that, it's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is over space, and that's this kind of
filament.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells that are smaller, those are the
vegetative cells where photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells that are larger are the
heterocyst cells where nitrogen fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: is taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two kinds of cells and elaborate
developmental processes that are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place has been very well studied over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is separating out the two processes
in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, what you will see is that
these kinds of single cell organisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: fix nitrogen, single cell cyanobacteria,
they separate out the processes in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is of interest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the circadian rhythm
business comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so cyanothiceae, again, here are the
different kinds of cyanothiceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been isolated from various parts
of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we work on primarily,
51142, that was isolated by Lou Sherman's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab at Purdue when they went out to Port
Aram says in Texas, so these are from
[SPEAKER_00]: benthic water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are also found in open ocean,
and very interesting stories that are
[SPEAKER_00]: developing in how those cyanothiceae
operate in the open ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now what I want to point out here is
that it's the phylogelating relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: of cyanothiceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's easy to sequence a genome
any given evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sequence a bacterial genome,
and you have tons and tons of data,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you run them through pipelines,
and then you find out all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some years ago in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are majority of the ones that were
known, and what I show here is that
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanothiceae, again, that 51142,
and here is the other one that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should be very clear here is that the
two are very closely related in this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to this notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, there are other
cyanobacterial species like the
[SPEAKER_00]: synecococcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are quite distant from a phylogenetic
point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will play an important role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about 51142, and what is an
approach that is being called nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: systems biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is looking at all the things that
happen in the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call this thing physiology in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we are going to go into,
but in much more detail, and with an
[SPEAKER_00]: approach that takes into account the
entire genome and its associated
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's unicellular and fixes
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diurnal rhythm results in numerous
intracellular changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this electron micrograph,
what I want to show you is what a
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacterial cell looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a typical gram-negative bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an outer envelope layer with the
plasma membrane and outer membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inside is this whole elaborate network
of membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thylakoid membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same kind of membrane system
that's present in chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has all kinds of other things,
intracellular body.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that is being studied at this
institution very much is this one called
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxyzone, where carbon fixation takes
place and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let me first show you the
cellular or ultra-structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle Lieberton, as a graduate student,
did this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a two nanometer tomographic slice
images that show the intracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: details, showing the thylakoid membranes
how they are laid down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And G here is glycogen bodies or glycogen
storage bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: C is carboxyzone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these are shown,
and these are individual slices shown one
[SPEAKER_00]: after another.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put those two together,
this is what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a movie associated with it,
but I will not go into the complication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, again, mapped to PC conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see here is this elaborate
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still the largest or the most
detailed description of a cyanobacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: cell to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what it shows is the entire
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cutout, and it's full with those
green-colored, pseudo-colored membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thylakoid membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at that cell, a typical E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli cell and a typical cyanobacterial
cell, that will be the distinguishing
[SPEAKER_00]: feature, the intracellular membrane
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's thylakoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we counted numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 21 carboxyzomes and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this is what a
cyanobacterial cell looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now let's go into the business of
dynamics or rhythms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to these cells under
alternating light-dark conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stay away from considerations
of circadian rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a set of studies that I'm not going
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some subtle differences between
diurnal rhythms and circadian rhythm
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anybody's interested, I'll be happy
to discuss that later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diurnal rhythms, we set up experiments
that are very, very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the L side, the left side,
and 12 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the blue side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the red side on the right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the first thing to observe
is that when we look at specific time
[SPEAKER_00]: points during the light period and the
dark period, and we measure
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, here is darkness,
here is light, and what you see is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the capacity of photosynthesis goes down
dramatically during the dark period,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it comes back up during the light
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in contrast, nitrogen fixation takes
place exclusively in the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the temporal separation of the two
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we did in those early
days is take samples every two hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that there are a whole bunch
of undergraduate students who lose their
[SPEAKER_00]: circadian rhythms, and they collect all of
these samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting is that this
system is so robust is that looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: data, you can immediately say,
OK, this person at 2 o'clock in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning did not take the right sample
because of the oscillations that take
[SPEAKER_00]: place in various things that we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so collecting those samples,
and those samples were then used in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of the same samples were used in a
variety of omics-level studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let me show you what happens to
the organization of the thylakoid between
[SPEAKER_00]: light and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in darkness, D10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 10 hours into darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is L10.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is light, 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that here,
the thylakoid membranes, their relative
[SPEAKER_00]: orientations change, but two different
kinds of intracellular bodies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is glycogen granule that accumulate
during the light phase, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where active photosynthesis is taking
place, and the carbon is getting stored in
[SPEAKER_00]: the form of glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dark phase, as you will see in a
few minutes, that glycogen is broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually the engine that drives
nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nitrogen that's fixed goes into
these bodies that are called cyanophysin
[SPEAKER_00]: granules, and that's the storage area or
the volume for the fixed nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is subsequently used in biosynthesis
during the following day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going over and over again through
these processes in a periodic diagonal
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a beautiful system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I have mentioned, photosynthesis
and nitrogen fixation are separated
[SPEAKER_00]: temporally in the same cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now comes into now looking at all
different kinds of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spend a lot of time on
transcriptomics, but we have done
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript, protein, metabolite,
post-translational modifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those, but basically with the same
samples so that we can compare the
[SPEAKER_00]: different omics-level data, one with the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing is that nitrogen is
gene cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogenase, this enzyme, it's large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a few proteins that are
components of the nitrogenase enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also requires all sorts of very
unusual cofactors, the details of which we
[SPEAKER_00]: are beginning to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for it to synthesize and insert all of
those cofactors into nitrogenase,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a large set of genes that are
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many bacteria, by the way,
bacteria and archaea are the only
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only prokaryotes can fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no eukaryote that is known that
can fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cyanoticin 51142, there is this
large set of contiguous genes in gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, a whole set that's looking
leftward and a whole set that's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: rightward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altogether, 35 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come back to this business of 35
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different cyanoticins have practically
the same type of organization of the NIF
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's first look at the expression
profiles at the transcript level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is really very tight
coordinate control of the expression at
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcriptional level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me describe this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a log two ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a seven, I'm sorry,
nine log difference between the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and the bottom of that.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is light.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these genes are getting
co-ordinately controlled, coming all from
[SPEAKER_00]: this cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this 28,000 base pair chunk of DNA
that's present in cyanothecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how tightly they are
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have continued these experiments in
subsequent years for many, many days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does not die away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very carefully controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we take all of the transcriptome
data and we do modeling on those by doing
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple Pearson correlation
coefficients and looking at what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between different genes that
have the same kind of expression profile
[SPEAKER_00]: over a diurnal behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you come up, we came up with this
kind of a model that we call is a read
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me describe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark one hour, five hour, nine hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is light one hour, five hour,
nine hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red is up regulation four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this faint blue color is 16
times down regulation.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these actually show all the genes
that are present in a cyanobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the cyanotexy 51142.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every dot represents the transcription
level for every gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's invariant in the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is variant are the levels of
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the darkness, what I say energy
metabolism basically respiration that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up first followed by nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also go down toward the end of
the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes up is this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights, it's lighting up and it's
lighting up really high here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also goes down during the light
period toward the latter part of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not just the presence of light
or darkness, but a careful programming
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That determines the transcriptional
profiles of every gene that's present in
[SPEAKER_00]: this organism.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on those data, this is only
based on the transcriptional profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with this core cellular model
of the processes that are taking place
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the cyanobacterium cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's again very simple in this
diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, I show all the things that
are happening in the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is summing up the metabolic processes
that are taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the right part are all the things that
are happening in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me describe this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this is a photosynthetic
organism, this box actually is very active
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one expects, photosynthesis,
meaning both the photo part, the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer processes, as well as the
synthesis part, the carbon fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, are extraordinarily highly
active in this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon gets fixed and stored in
glycogen, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the darkness, then, the glycogen is
degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glycogen degradation pathway turns on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then respiration comes up at a very
high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes away all the oxygen from inside
the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have direct measurements of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nitrogen fixation takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not just nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many processes, such as hydrogen
production, hydrogen is things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: are also controlled in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this period of time, the inside of
the cell is relatively anoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the unusual and special feature
of this kind of cyanobacterial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then amino acid biosynthesis happens
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extra nitrogen is stored away in
cyanophysin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this continues to happen over and over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diurnal cycle, summarizing that,
photosynthesis results in oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: production during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: High rates of respiration generate low
intracellular oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oxygen tension during early night
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oxygen-sensitive enzymes, such as
nitrogenase, can then function in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Klaus is my host, I thought that I
should at least touch on the next topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is proteomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we have done this interrogation
at different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we all know, after many years of
systems biology, that mapping one
[SPEAKER_00]: omics-level map on to another omics-level
map still remains a challenging thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's simply because from very basic
biology, there is no reason to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that what happens at the transcription
level will be essentially followed at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of all the post-transcriptional,
translational, and post-translational
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in seeing,
what is the level of correlation between
[SPEAKER_00]: the diurnal oscillations, or if there is
any diurnal oscillation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So same kind of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It required a little bit more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did these experiments in collaboration
with Dick Smith and colleagues at PNNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those days, these were really
challenging experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of tells you what we have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two hours, we collected samples,
the same samples that were used for
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the cycling patterns of
the proteins look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same kind of color scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to notice is that the
read is not that dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not that many proteins at the level of
detection that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are oscillating in their absolute protein
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the overall story is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, photosynthesis comes up during
light, and nitrogen fixation comes up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a description of what happens
at an overall protein level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, at that time, a super expensive
experiment to do all these things over all
[SPEAKER_00]: these time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided to do it at least for two
cycles, just to see what is repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by looking at the profile,
you can see that the same kind of profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less, is emerging day after day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 251 proteins exhibited measurable
oscillations in their abundance under
[SPEAKER_00]: alternating light-dark conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: We go in through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, without looking at the
details, basically 25% of them belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: central intermediary metabolic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 19% are involved in photosynthesis and
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are proteins whose absolute amounts
are changing over the light-dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go back to nitrogenous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is, again, something really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the transcript levels of all of
the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show only the structural genes,
NIFHDK, and two other genes, just to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see how they have very tightly
controlled a single peak in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the dark period, it also goes
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm emphasizing this because there is
a story behind that, that we do not have
[SPEAKER_00]: much idea about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But biology does it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a program that determines that
things will come up during a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then things will go down during the
same apparent dark period or light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what happens with the proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the proteins are also
getting degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get synthesized, but they get
degraded during the nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their levels are extraordinarily low
in the light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are binary oscillation
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody is interested, we can talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are interesting stories by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the cyanothicydiunal cycle,
the regulation of nitrogenous,
[SPEAKER_00]: the NIFGENs are expressed during the dark
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: NIF structural proteins are synthesized
during the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done dynamic proteomics,
which shows that the NIF proteins are
[SPEAKER_00]: degraded during late dark hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those studies, what we find is that
post-translational modifications are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be happy to discuss that later on
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nitrogenous assembles and functions
during early and middle dark hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now comes the Yang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the same cell is also
photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question that we asked,
is it just darkness that turns off
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are there extra exquisite control
elements that are present in the organism
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes sure that oxygen is not evolved
when nitrogen is functioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I will tell you is, again,
a snapshot of only one of many things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly in that way, where there is
cellular control in protecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogenous from accidental production of
oxygen from photosystem II, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in photosynthesis, photosystem II is
the enzyme that produces oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Klaas just reminded me of those early days
when we did not even know how to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the years, it has gone
viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone to a stage where we have a 1.9
angstrom resolution structure that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I can say is that PS2 complex is
extremely complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lots of proteins, and it has also
lots of co-factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are important here that I'm
pointing out here are four manganese ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have known from early studies with
cyanobacterial cells with people like
[SPEAKER_00]: George Shinne from the 1960s, where they
have looked at the how manganese gets
[SPEAKER_00]: inserted in photosystem II, how that gets
functional, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason I pointed out manganese is
that at the center, this is a cartoon
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram that simplifies that very complex
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the heart of photosystem II are these
two proteins, D1 and D2.
[SPEAKER_00]: D1 is the protein that plays important
role in coordinating those manganese atoms
[SPEAKER_00]: in photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those manganese atoms are absolutely
necessary for the oxygen evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short, if you cannot bind,
if photosystem II cannot bind manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take away that possibility of oxygen
production by photosystem II if there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of light around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a little bit of oxygen is enough
to kill nitrogenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So D1 protein that's encoded by this gene
called PSBA, it's a well-known gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: provides many critical ligands for the
manganese cluster that is at the heart of
[SPEAKER_00]: water splitting and oxygen evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: PSBA has five copies in cyanotc-51142.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of these five, only one that we
call PSBA-4, that's just a nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the other four are expressed highly
during the light period, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: they function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is light, and those red lines
actually shows the sum total of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: four genes of how they behave at the
transcriptional level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice there is a fifth copy,
this PSBA-4, that's behaving just the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red one is the one that's PSBA-4.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones are, the black ones are the
ones that are the normal PSBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, this is kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is a D1 protein being expressed in the
darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no business of being expressed at
that time, because photosystem II is
[SPEAKER_00]: nonfunctional at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became clear when we sequenced the gene
and the protein part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are specific amino acid residues
that we know from that crystal structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that are involved in ligation of the
manganese cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nature has done that beautiful
site-specific mutagenesis experiment some
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many billion years ago in cyanotc,
where each and every one of those residues
[SPEAKER_00]: are taken out and replaced by things that,
in the 1980s and 90s, many of us were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in doing site-specific
mutagenesis to find out which residue
[SPEAKER_00]: chain gives rise to non-ligation of
manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short, we recapitulated this
in synecocystis by taking this gene from
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanotc PSBA-4, expressing it in a
synecocystis 6803 cell that does not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any PSBA gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that that one,
the one shown with red, PS2 is formed but
[SPEAKER_00]: it cannot produce oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is expected, but we show it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if we take one of those other
genes, the PSBA-1, then introduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: that into synecocystis allows photosystem
II to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm telling you here is that here
is, again, a control system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why do you need it in the darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that I must
mention that when we looked at this
[SPEAKER_00]: specific form of PSBA that has this amino
acid replacement, they are present in many
[SPEAKER_00]: diastrophic cyanobacterial strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the list has grown tremendously since
we published this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call it the sentinel D1 because it
is a way of the cells making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen is not evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was something that was discovered
by Kim Wagner, who was a former graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: student and now works at a local company.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, well, what's the intensity of
moonlight in a full night?
[SPEAKER_00]: And cyanobacteria are growing on the
surface of the pond and did the simulation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, there is enough oxygen
there that kills nitrogenous activity in
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanothusae under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the real natural reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the reasons probably the
cyanobacteria go to this extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some proof, but not definitive
proof of this entire model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, in the darkness, dissociation
of some other proteins and synthesis of
[SPEAKER_00]: insertion of SD1, that's the sentinel D1,
and then removal of SD1, insertion of D1
[SPEAKER_00]: when light comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are challenging experiments,
but we have initial evidence that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way cyanothusae is operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the yin and the yang.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have about five minutes or so?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just go into the next phase of
another challenging set of experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have embarked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it has been now close to three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been three years now that we have
been involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the project has to do with designing
nitrogen fixing ability in oxygenic
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the background that I provided to you
with the cyanothusae and synagocystis
[SPEAKER_00]: systems will make it easier for you to
understand where we want to go with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an evolving story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a collaborative one where Costas
Maranas is a computational scientist at
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two of my synthetic biology
colleagues in the engineering school of
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington University, we have teamed up
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why even get into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because nitrogen is an essential
nutrient for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a long-term goal of this nitrogen
program is to endow plant cells with
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixing ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the big goal that a lot of people
are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, photosynthesis in
plants produce oxygen, a potent inhibitor
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, nitrogenase needs a
lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot put nitrogenase in a tissue
that does not have enough energy source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be able to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you deal with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall goal for our systems and
synthetic biology approaches is to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: the design principles to establish
nitrogen fixing ability in the unicellular
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacterium synagocystis 6803.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the knowledge base that's created in
this project will be directly applicable
[SPEAKER_00]: to engineer nitrogen fixing crop plants,
we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this is kind of a schematic
diagram of what we are talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make a nitrogen fixing crop
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to engineer nitrogen fixing
symbiosis for crop plants, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is putting nitrogen fixing
module directly into the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one way to think about it is that
we just heard all these things about
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanotc-51142.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just transfer all that entire machinery
into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not even approach this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we said, let's just take a
shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's try to figure out the principles
that are involved in putting in
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogenase into an oxygenic environment
in an organism that does not know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to our good old friend,
synagocystis, and we want to transfer the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogenase program, not just the gene and
proteins, but the program itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it, into synagocystis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make synagocystis that's diazotrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the design principles,
presumably in some future years,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be used for making this nitrogen
fixing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we chose these two organisms
simply, again, bringing back that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenetically very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, synagocystis is a nitrogen
fixing cyanobacterium which has lost its
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way people have described it in
papers that describe the phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to establish in
synagocystis the nitrogen fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: circuitry normally present in cyanotice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to tell you in two minutes
is that the first phase of it is over
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have been able to now,
this was the biggest challenge at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the project, is this 35 genes
in NIF cluster, put all of these in,
[SPEAKER_00]: move them from cyanotice into
synagocystis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are new techniques that are used
by the synthetic biologists that allows us
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could take, we could use a method
called DNA assembler that, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the details are not important here,
but if anybody's interested, I will be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to discuss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very quickly, first of all,
put together an E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, first in yeast and then in E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, this large plasmid that's about 40
kilobase pair that has all the genes here
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly in the way cyanotice has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to take this approach rather
than the traditional synthetic biology
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches that Chris Voight and
colleagues are doing, which is first
[SPEAKER_00]: taking apart every gene, putting in
control circuits on them, and putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: back together and make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that we are not clever enough
to do that, so just borrow the whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: from a cyanobacterial cells, move it into
a cyanobacterial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a little bit of time, but we could
transfer all of this into synagocystis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the last two years, this thing is
stably replicating in synagocystis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth is not compromised because of the
production of all of these genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know at the transcriptional level,
all of these gene products are made,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also show you another construct where we
have now started whittling down the 35,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have now down to 24, and we have it
down now to even 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show you those data,
but basically the stage that we are right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is that synagocystis 6803 can fix
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what it shows here is that
here are the three genes that make the
[SPEAKER_00]: three structural proteins of nitrogenase,
NIFHDK.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plants, only one of these, the iron
protein, has been expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts with great difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of, again, this bad thing called
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at every level of the production of the
functional nitrogenase, there is oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: control in a negative manner, and what we
see here is that in this organism where we
[SPEAKER_00]: put in all of this, we can have
transcription of NIFHDK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black one actually shows the whole set
of 35 genes, and I show you this truncated
[SPEAKER_00]: version 24, which has appreciably higher
level of transcription level for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some negative regulators
here, and I will not go into the details
[SPEAKER_00]: of that, but important thing is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time, to our knowledge,
that in an oxygenic photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: organism, one can establish the nitrogen
fixation machinery, and so you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is production that's taking
place, nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me also point out, because usually
this question comes up, this organism is
[SPEAKER_00]: still not diazotrophic, because the
control circuits are not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this bug, the synecocystis that
has these nitrogenase genes, it produces
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogenase at the wrong time,
namely at the beginning of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the normal program inside
the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had recent success in providing
some control elements in this cell to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it go the way cyanothecy goes,
but we are still quite some distance from
[SPEAKER_00]: achieving the stage where a robust
nitrogen fixation cycle, the diurnal
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythm, is expressed in cyanothecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project is, the first part of the
project that I talked about on cyanothecy
[SPEAKER_00]: systems biology is a collaboration with
Lou Sherman at Purdue University,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a whole bunch of people led by Dick
Smith, at PNNL, Pacific Northwest National
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab, and then for the nitrogen fixation
project in synecocystis, these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: four groups and all the people who are
working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my research group, and Eric
Richards may still remember Redstock Hall,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's right in front of our lab,
and I thank you, and I thank you,
[SPEAKER_00]: my close collaborators, the cyanobacterial
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a beautiful seminar, and I would
like to ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the beginning you showed us the
diameters of the different cyanobacteria,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the synecocystis was smaller than the
ones that do all the great stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that volume difference have any
ramifications in getting the diurnal
[SPEAKER_07]: nitrogen fixation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple answer is we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, they have looked pretty hard
for cells that are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cyanothesis that have been
found, principally by John Zier's group at
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz, that have much smaller size,
but those are very special cyanothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: that do not have photosynthesis and carbon
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are cells that live together with an
algal algae, and there the story is more,
[SPEAKER_00]: the algae fixes carbon, and that
specialized cyanothesis produces,
[SPEAKER_00]: fixes nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, the cells are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really correlation, we have no
idea, but we cannot address that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there are a lot of really
interesting examples of regulation of
[SPEAKER_04]: things happening in the darker light that
started before the next phase actually
[SPEAKER_04]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a readout of the nutrient state
in the cell, and somehow nitrogenase is
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to shut off when glycogen is
running out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you measured the glycogen at
different points at night?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glycogen runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not strictly correlated with just
the level of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it all comes down to the
central control element that's found in
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, that's P2 protein in bacteria,
that senses the relative levels of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that story works fine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is not known is how the central
oscillator of cyanobacteria cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very well defined through the
work of Susan Goldin, and colleagues,
[SPEAKER_00]: called CHI proteins, CHI ABC, how is that
controlling this entire program?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have an answer to that,
but some of those specialized regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: elements are involved in figuring out the
entire program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a complex program.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of oscillating systems have negative
feedback loops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just wondering if you could
elaborate on evidence for or against such
[SPEAKER_03]: a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, the synthesis of an
enzyme reaches a certain concentration
[SPEAKER_03]: that then begins to shut down the
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that level, again, we don't have any
understanding for this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the level of transcription,
there is a lot of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are negative feedbacks that are
set up, as well as positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those regulatory elements have been
identified by us and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the places where we know
quite a bit is this business of how the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of the transcript, I'm not talking
about the proteins, of nitrogenase go down
[SPEAKER_00]: during the dark phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with elements present in the
genome that give rise to small antisense
[SPEAKER_00]: elements that get expressed exactly at
that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't proven it completely,
but the idea is that that then gets turned
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole business of being this kind of
rhythm, this whole question of
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipation is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see evidence of that in every step
of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell knows when light comes on,
so they get prepared for that by
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesizing both at the transcript
protein and co-factor level of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells know that oxygen will be coming
out at that time, so nitrogenase goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down, and the other way also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there will be many such
control elements that are present,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we do not have much idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the enzyme levels and the
feedback on that, not much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to follow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you kind of duplicated some of these
experiments where you've extended the
[SPEAKER_03]: nighttime or the daylight period?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we were talking about some of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gotten all of these crazy
experiments, 18.6 and 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you people 20 hours of light
and four hours of darkness, this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely doesn't work,
but it's four hours of light and 20 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a range in which it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I can summarize those studies
by saying the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have sufficient amount of
glycogen that's been stored, then nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation does take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in doing so, we also figured out that
we can separate out the two central
[SPEAKER_00]: processes respiration and nitrogen
fixation during the dark period quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit or much closer, depending on the
length of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the classic time-space
experiments that we're doing and modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: on those, but it's complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has ecological implications,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be related to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is, of course, time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time to make a transcript.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time to create a source of energy
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to synthesize and remove your
machinery, which is very costly,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an energy cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you play instead of this light-dark
play, you play with the amount of light
[SPEAKER_02]: that you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just capture down the amount of
energy and accumulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not in great detail, but we have
measured ATP and NADPH levels in these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those change predictably, as you would
expect, based on the energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as what is the cause and what
is the effect, then it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You showed that there's an ortholog of the
sentinel D1 in other cytobacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that also found in the chloroplasts?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what became of that when it is
supposed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's hard to tell what the exact
meaning of it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we quoted it that way, cyanobacteria
that can fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much conservation of those variant
amino acids is there across the group that
[SPEAKER_01]: has the sentinel D1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are they functional?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, let's say we take a specific
aspartic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through site-specific experiments done in
lab, we know that aspartic D1 is changed
[SPEAKER_00]: to an uncharged recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even when it's changed to a glutamate,
that compromises manganese validation in
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to turn information around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is that those changes are
different in the different cytobacteria as
[SPEAKER_00]: D1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more like nature took the
canonical P is the A that makes the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: D1 and then made those specific changes so
that it no longer can lie with manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are not the same changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think is the center for the
bacteria switching from the Nase protein,
[SPEAKER_05]: fractional Nase protein, to degradation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's the proteins or the
chemicals?
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, my answer is we have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that the proteins are made and
they just stay around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the need for making them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one phrase that I've used many times is
that the first hour of darkness is the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of light for the nitrogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcripts get made, and then the
transcripts get degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Projects get made, assembles, function
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they get degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get degraded at times when there
is no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that is necessary, and whether that is
absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the psychics that we are putting in
synapses, we don't have an answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're trying to answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really don't have any idea of why
that proteolysis is necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you properly announce for me now,
if there's anything about any tagging
[SPEAKER_02]: systems or post-synapsing application,
like arching phosphorylation that was
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arching phosphorylation does play a role.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we don't really extend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So globins play an important role in
providing the noxium environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are globins expressed normally?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So globins that bind oxygen in the beam
system that I described, they are used to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sequester the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the local concentration of oxygen
goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In synapses system, there's only one
globin gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has nothing to do with this
business, similar for science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying maybe it's a bad process.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that absolute levels of those are
very, very low that cannot account for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local concentration of oxygen,
when even 1.62 is working, is super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really have to scrub it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering, is there a specific
machinery in synapses system for
[SPEAKER_06]: harvesting nitrogen that the other
bacteria do not have?
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does it harvest nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about already fixed
nitrogen, like nitrate or ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the standard thing that global past
have, which is transporters that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present that bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are then utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, something that I didn't show here
or pointed out is that the organs that fix
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, they actually sense that very,
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we put in even micromolar
concentration of nitrate into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanophysic cells, nitrogen fixation
ability goes down over a matter of one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if HDK synthesis stops, and again,
the proteins get created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know why that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there is enough fixed nitrogen,
the organisms do not do this in a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is well known from work on other
bacteria systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should end here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
