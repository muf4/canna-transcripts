[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name's Erin McKeon, and it's great
to see so many familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last year and a half, I've had the
pleasure of being a grad student in the
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture department and working very
closely also with Cornell Plantations and
[SPEAKER_00]: their staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really gravitated to public
horticulture because of a love of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, public horticulture really
brings together how plants can be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: serve ecological communities and human
communities alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was preparing for this
presentation, I was kind of asking myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: why marketing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you choose this topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what makes it exciting about public
horticulture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys might be wondering that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, basically, I felt that there
was kind of a gap in knowledge here in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the collaborative aspects of
public horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of public marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt that by gaining expertise in
this and coupling that with my passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, that I would be able to fill a
niche when I go and seek a career after
[SPEAKER_00]: this master's program is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to share with you some
of the results from my research while I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to put it in context,
in an increasingly competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace, public horticulture
institutions have started joining together
[SPEAKER_00]: with other arts and culture organizations
in their area to create what is called a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative marketing group,
which I'm going to shorten and say CMG,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think you guys will all enjoy
hearing better than the mouthful of
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative marketing groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So synonymously, we'll use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this increasingly competitive
marketplace, the collaborative marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: groups have enabled gardens and other
organizations to reduce their marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: costs and also tap into customer
expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, this collaboration is a
strategy for maximizing the potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and better addressing the
concept of destination marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project directly addressed the
knowledge gap in the field of public
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture related to these strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaborative partnerships are socially
contrived mechanisms for collective
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: A CMG is a venture sharing shared between
a group of associated organizations that
[SPEAKER_00]: aims to obtain greater recognition,
resources, and results for those
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations when compared to those
individual organizations working alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CMG efforts specifically aim to
increase the success of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations as they engage in
collaborative problem solving and they
[SPEAKER_00]: also create a platform for information
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the core research question was are
collaborative marketing groups an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way for public gardens to market
their mission to their audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sequentially, I also asked what
were the motivations and conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: that garden to join?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the key activities and
best management practices that were
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes of the CMG?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what were the most valued
outcomes, both monetary and non-monetary?
[SPEAKER_00]: The methods that I used to kind of obtain
this data were in two sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first was interviews with five
case study gardens and key marketing staff
[SPEAKER_00]: at those gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second was an electronic survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so of the 30 gardens that I sent the
survey to, 25 completed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a return rate, it was pretty good
and it was such a small sample size
[SPEAKER_00]: because each of these gardens were
participating in a collaborative marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of like the key factor in
them getting the survey to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the survey asked about the garden
satisfaction with their CMG performance
[SPEAKER_00]: and it also was designed to answer the
core research questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interviews were, the purpose of those
were basically to understand the current
[SPEAKER_00]: practices being employed by these CMGs at
public gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that interview was conducted in two
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first section was using the
business model generation canvas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I recognize that this you may not be
able to see each of the headers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is a visual way of laying out a
business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have basically the experience of
using this is you bring a big like six by
[SPEAKER_00]: five version of this into a room where you
have shareholders or stakeholders in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use post-it notes and kind of
dialogue to then populate each area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a way of visually representing the
business model and outlining, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the, what is the value proposition
of the mission of the garden, who are
[SPEAKER_00]: their customers, their audience,
and then what are the channels that they
[SPEAKER_00]: reach that audience with, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we got to the section of key
partners, we turned to the conversation to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask, how did the CMG basically open up new
channels or provide key activities or key
[SPEAKER_00]: resources for them to achieve their
mission, which in nonprofit horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: is paramount achieving the mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of here for a visual
aid, but if anybody's interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more about the canvas and the
business model generation handbook,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd talk to you about that later and could
provide more resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through each of the
five case study interviews now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically the second part of the
interview, which I failed to comment on
[SPEAKER_00]: was a series of open ended questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the summary of each interview I'm
about to provide is the canvas and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the open ended questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really was obviously qualitative
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a lot of fun while we were
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gardens gained a lot out of that
process of going through the canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I gained quite a bit of
information as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first interview was with Cornell
Plantations right here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are part of a collaborative
effort of local cultural institutions
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Discovery Trail, which many of
you hopefully are aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discovery Trail Partnership is a group of
nonprofit organizations based here that
[SPEAKER_00]: promote the awareness and understanding of
the connections between art, history,
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, science, and the natural
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of the Discovery Trail is to
collectively market the member
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations to tourists that are over 90
miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that tourist audience is a region
that's a little bit less attainable for
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, specifically Cornell Plantations,
to put valuable marketing resources to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Discovery Trail really aids in
compensating for that in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Discovery Trail is supported by annual
membership dues as well as through the
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic tourism, the Tompkins County
Strategic Tourism Board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll mention its main function
is to increase public awareness and
[SPEAKER_00]: positively impact the visitation of each
of the member organizations to Discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: Trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that has evolved out
of this successful partnership over time
[SPEAKER_00]: is an educational program called Kids
Discover the Trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was kind of a learning moment
in even just the first interview where I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that the longevity or the age of
a collaborative marketing group influenced
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Discovery Trail,
once they became more seasoned,
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to create and evolve or basically
formalize this educational program through
[SPEAKER_00]: their shared kind of collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll come back to that point later in
the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other non-mandatory benefits of the
Discovery Trail for plantations include
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthening their branded cultural
identity of Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really creating more of a destination
marketing brand here in Ithaca for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't living here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come visit, they can really
identify with what there is to do when you
[SPEAKER_00]: visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then top-of-mind awareness in
potential customer or audiences' minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes for both regional people that
live here and then people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting, creating that top-of-mind
awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second interview is with Garden in the
Woods, which is the headquarters for New
[SPEAKER_00]: England Wildflower Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Massachusetts Botanic Garden Group
was established in 2012 to better leverage
[SPEAKER_00]: the various public gardens throughout the
state of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was created by the
recommendation of the Massachusetts Office
[SPEAKER_00]: of Travel and Tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was actually an outside,
you know, body saying, you all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gardens need to get together and
create this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also felt that strength in
numbers would really enable them to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase audience awareness of the 11
participating gardens and make kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: viable and robust partnership if they
joined together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CMG is still in the early stages of
its development, but it's already impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: how New England Wildflower Society thinks
about marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funded through member dues and as
well as they're able to gain financial
[SPEAKER_00]: support from Convention and Visitors
Bureaus and the Massachusetts Office of
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel and Tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's funding that they wouldn't have
access to if they weren't collaborating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another kind of key outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this CMG, provides a really key
marketing channel and the vehicle for that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a shared website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a common theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these CMGs create websites to
collectively tell what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether that's through an events
calendar or just simply through creating
[SPEAKER_00]: links to their websites, this is a way to
achieve a more dynamic marketing mix for
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens that a lot of times don't have a
very, very substantial marketing budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So furthermore, this CMG strengthens New
England Wildflower Society's relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with their peer gardens and it really does
reinforce that climate for knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing among professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much in nonprofit horticulture or any
nonprofit field, there are various people
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the same positions trying to
achieve the same goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can share kind of day-to-day
knowledge about day-to-day activities,
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to best achieve the promotion of
these individual organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically is what the CMG is able to
formalize the process of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chicago Botanic Garden was my third
interview and destination marketing is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an ever important strategy for
nonprofit gardens to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing in order to increase their
visitation and attendance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do North is the collaborative that Chicago
is a part of and these organizations have
[SPEAKER_00]: joined forces to kind of like bring
attention to the North Shore region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is 40 minutes north of downtown
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason why this is significant
is because people go to Chicago to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown but they don't necessarily know
what's going on in that neighborhood up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a wealth of cultural
organizations there and they've decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: join together to cross program and cross
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interview with Chicago Botanic
Garden revealed that Do North has not just
[SPEAKER_00]: an economic impact on the garden but also
on the region as a whole by attracting
[SPEAKER_00]: tourists to that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to this destination
marketing strategy, the collaborative also
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts their bottom line by appealing to
a few key donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was also kind of a big
realization from this interview and the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I'll talk about next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that give large contributions to
gardens then want to have some involvement
[SPEAKER_00]: in the decision making and kind of the
future of how that garden is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: portrayed to its audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the staff at the Chicago Botanic
Garden really felt that they were serving
[SPEAKER_00]: these key donors' wishes by demonstrating
that they're using their philanthropic
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions in an effective way by
collaborating with these other
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations and basically creating a
brand to promote the whole area,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the public response also has been very
positive to the Do North collaborative
[SPEAKER_00]: because they like seeing the organizations
in their area work.
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me to Red Butte Garden in
Salt Lake City, which is part of a CMG
[SPEAKER_00]: called Foothill Cultural District,
which is comprised of seven destinations
[SPEAKER_00]: along Salt Lake City's Foothill Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mission of this marketing group is to
provide visitors with the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience Utah's fascinating art,
culture, history, and stunning natural
[SPEAKER_00]: areas in an easily accessible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using public transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Foothills Cultural District also
was really created because of the vision
[SPEAKER_00]: of a local philanthropist, Zeke Dumke,
who also gave significant contributions to
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden and has a building named after
him and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's one of their key donors and really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said to them and the other
organizations, he said, hey, I give to all
[SPEAKER_00]: of you individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want you all to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did some trialing and some
piloting of that program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it basically was formalized in
2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the key resources that comes
out of this collaborative marketing group
[SPEAKER_00]: is they really can leverage the
collaboration when they're applying for
[SPEAKER_00]: grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they end up acquiring funds because
they state that they're in collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with these other organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also part of a cultural tax
district.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks favorably upon their
collaborative efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this culture of collaboration also
creates the perception that Red Butte and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other member gardens are community
players.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this has kind of evolved in
the direction of more shared programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's no longer just a marketing
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my final interview was at the Scott
Arboretum in Media, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody's been to the Philly area,
you know that that area is rich in
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical gardens and arboretum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Scott Arboretum is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're part of two separate collaborative
marketing groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one I'm going to comment on
is called Greater Philadelphia Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the oldest collaborative that
I interviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's comprised of 30 member gardens in
a 30-mile radius of Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a high density of gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that regional proximity was kind of
the basis for why they created the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also then evolved because it
creates this knowledge sharing among
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, as I've mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the key activities of Greater
Philadelphia Gardens is that they work to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote the member gardens across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the members in that CMG are
really well-known gardens, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: Longwood, which probably many of you have
heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's others which are lesser
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the benefit that each of these
members are afforded is that their
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation is extended by way of being
associated with these other bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another really key activity is that the
pooling of those resources enables Greater
[SPEAKER_00]: Philadelphia Gardens to market to an
international audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to give just a moment
to recognize is that, I didn't interview
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but the Bartrams Garden is really
small but has huge historic significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their visitation levels are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like many nonprofit gardens,
has struggled financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they've tracked through Google
Analytics and through their attendance is
[SPEAKER_00]: that because of Greater Philadelphia
Gardens marketing to an international
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, they get tons of international
visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they couldn't pay to market the way
that Greater Philadelphia Gardens is
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing for them, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was just a really key learning for
my interview with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second partnership that I'd like to
just talk about briefly with the Scott
[SPEAKER_00]: Arboretum is one that's more web-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Delaware County Arts
Consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are focused on a web platform and
events calendar called the Philly Fun
[SPEAKER_00]: Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it's a way for the Scott
Arboretum to market to people regionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though you're seated in a
community and you think you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: handle on how to best access people in
your community, there's always new ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this website really enables the
Scott Arboretum to reach a local audience
[SPEAKER_00]: that they previously didn't know how to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conditions for joining are really a
big key focus for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by definition, collaboration requires
that a certain amount of autonomy is
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificed by the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to work together in order to
put their own objectives on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really key before starting to
create a collaborative or deciding if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to join one would be that you want to
understand the institutional factors of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other organizations that you're
joining in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to understand the culture and the
organizational goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondarily, a major theme was
that nonprofit leaders, whether they be
[SPEAKER_00]: executive directors or key donors,
were a huge influential motivation for why
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden would join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Existing network and regional proximity
also greatly influenced the likelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: a collaborative either being created or
someone deciding to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to share some of the results of
the electronic survey, the motivation to
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate must be based on the CMG's
ability to kind of attain outcomes that
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden couldn't achieve on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the survey respondents basically stated
that this was a strategic decision for
[SPEAKER_00]: them and that joining the collaboration
was really like paramount was that they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to join together with the other
arts and culture organizations to create
[SPEAKER_00]: that strength in numbers concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving into audience,
which we've talked about before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really accessing a wider tourist
audience through shared marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: activities was another major priority for
these gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMG's helped to establish kind of
transactional relationships with visitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the research was not showing that
anything beyond a transactional
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship was created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is people found out
about the garden or the organizations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the area and they went and visited,
but they didn't necessarily buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: membership or become donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a way that when you deepen
the programmatic involvement by creating
[SPEAKER_00]: something like Kids Discover the Trail,
you can start to draw in more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: relational relationship with that
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the key activities were shared
visibility and the vehicle for that was
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just creating an economy of scale
for these gardens to promote their garden
[SPEAKER_00]: through a website and lessen the
individual marketing costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a major driving force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, the interviews backed up
that the CMG opened up new channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were actually able to access new
customers or audience that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: previously kind of available to them
through the collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, from the electronic survey,
the respondents answered that the most
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable outcomes was increased publicity
and visibility of their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens indicated that the CMG had
improved relations with regional cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions because it facilitated and
formalized partnerships and collaborations
[SPEAKER_00]: that were already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were now given permission in a
way and given a platform to stand on in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to collaborate with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across all interviews, the larger the
garden and the more established the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative marketing group,
the more concrete the contributors or my
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewees were on why their garden was
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess that kind of goes without
saying, but it was still interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look at collaboratives that were
anywhere from starting founded in 1980s
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each interviewee really highly
valued the triple bottom line theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really takes into account and adds
value to social capital, reputation,
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness building as viable outcomes of
the collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more performance evaluation is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just say, yes, we have these
non-monetary outcomes and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's good to have a solid
understanding of that, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: benchmarking would definitely benefit
leaders in terms of decision-making and
[SPEAKER_00]: validating their involvement in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in conclusion, collaborative
marketing groups proved to be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way for organizations to work in
concert to achieve larger scale
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising while saving money and
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide a solution to align media and
publicity expenditures and help to stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: individual budgets while diversifying the
marketing mix of individual organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a better understanding of the
benefits of a CMG would enable public
[SPEAKER_00]: garden leaders to comprehend the value of
collaboration and justify the resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and staff time that they allocate to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, improved forecasting would
definitely help them to make informed
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, the findings from this study
and the use of the BMG Canvas and future
[SPEAKER_00]: research will help to provide knowledge
that is required to success fully engage
[SPEAKER_00]: in these formal collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to thank the professors,
my advisors, and committee members,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fellow public garden leadership
students, and all of you for listening
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's where social reputation
really comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when community members or members of
these organizations view that large garden
[SPEAKER_00]: as being philanthropic themselves in
sharing their brand and sharing their
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation, that's kind of where they gain
the benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, it's really in the nonprofit
field, you can kind of create things based
[SPEAKER_00]: on non-monetary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know how to answer this
question, but basically, they gain an
[SPEAKER_00]: improved reputation from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens more often in the
nonprofit field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nonprofit scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that help to answer any other
questions?
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
