[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was asked by Neil to continue this
general topic of horticulture and changing
[SPEAKER_02]: climates that they had for the semester
and asked me to talk about fruit crops and
[SPEAKER_02]: especially apples and grapes that I've
worked on for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would be happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to acknowledge Art DiGottano
from the Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also Dave Walton from Comstock,
as we've worked a lot together over the
[SPEAKER_02]: last year or so on a project funded by
NYSERDA, the Energy Research and
[SPEAKER_02]: Development Project, to look at climate
effects on various aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very broad-ranging project on
climate effects on New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been focusing on the apples and
grapes and we'd like to give you a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: overview of what we think are some of the
important factors that are occurring now
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the climate information is
from Art, so I have to definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledge his contributions there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really some of the key questions are,
has our climate been changing recently
[SPEAKER_02]: already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we just looking at potential climate
change or are we really talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: continuation of climate change?
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to some of the effects on
apples and grapes in New York due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what changes are expected for our
climate over the next 15, 20, 30,
[SPEAKER_02]: 40, 70, 80 years or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are likely to be some of those
effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously there's lots and lots of things
we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first let's just point out that the
climate is already changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really not too much doubt about
that, especially in the last 40 or 50
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The annual temperatures across New York
have warmed by almost two degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit, which is a major change on a
climatic scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter temperatures are warmed by
nearly five degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the winters are tending to warm up more
than the summers, which is generally good
[SPEAKER_02]: for most of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're willing to let the winters warm up
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the data of last spring frost has
become quite a bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show some data on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that there are about two more days per
year over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course that varies with your
location in the state, but there's been an
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in numbers of very hot days as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plot from Art just showing the
general trend over about 100 years of the
[SPEAKER_02]: top line of the black regression lines is
the 100 year trend, which is about almost
[SPEAKER_02]: three degrees warming over the last 100
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also made a regression from 1970,
or 1980 I guess it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, 1970, this stops at 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we've had some of the hottest
years since that graph stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the regression since about 1970 has
been quite a bit steeper with about four
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half degree warming over the last 30
years, which is not only a large amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: warming, but it's a large amount of
warming over a very short time period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as mentioned, the winters have been
warming more than the summers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from a project that Art worked
with us on for the grape industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but basically took his high resolution
algorithms to estimate temperatures
[SPEAKER_02]: between weather stations to get more of a
high resolution map of temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had him go backwards for about 30
years and generate these high resolution
[SPEAKER_02]: estimates of daily temperatures backwards
for about 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could summarize them over a 30 year
period, which is really what you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at climatic change rather than just
five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we could see is even in that short
period, these plots are the average number
[SPEAKER_02]: of days per year with temperatures below
minus 10 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a threshold value for grapes,
especially for grape budkill, for vinifera
[SPEAKER_02]: grapes, the premium wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of a key temperature for
the winter hardiness issue for grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on the top left, you can see the
plot in which on the left side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: scale are the warmer temperatures,
the reds and oranges, yellows are warmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the blues and purples and greens
are colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the upper left, you can see
during that 1980 to 1990 period what the
[SPEAKER_02]: general distribution was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see why the grapes,
wine grapes that are growing are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Finger Lakes, near the lakes,
a little bit up Hudson Valley,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then obviously onto Long Island,
because those are the warmer spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we just shifted to the last 10
years of the data set that were generated
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time in the lower right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see by just comparing now
significant changes in the warming of the
[SPEAKER_02]: winters and the numbers of days with these
killing temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and actually if you look at
Pennsylvania, you can see the really
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these have been very, very strong
changes in just quite a short time period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some of the implications of that,
we looked at those, that was sort of an
[SPEAKER_02]: overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just Geneva data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the plot, you can see we plotted
the coldest temperature each winter since
[SPEAKER_02]: 1948 or so on up to this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can see is, obviously you're
interested in the trends at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: because those are the ones that really
cause problems for the grape and wine
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I put a bar on there showing about
minus 10 to minus 15 or 16 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit is this sort of danger zone,
where if you're at minus 10 or so,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's into the bud kill point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Above that, you'll lose some buds,
but it's not a commercial real problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get below minus 10, then you can
really start having some problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since we removed most of the buds from
grape vines anyway, we can tolerate a
[SPEAKER_02]: significant amount of bud kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you start getting down to
minus 15, 16, you're looking at vine
[SPEAKER_02]: kills.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of your danger zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that before 1980 or so,
about every four or five years or so,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a significant kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was rather discouraging to
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since about 1980 until we had a couple
of cold years there in 2004, 2005,
[SPEAKER_02]: but since during that 22 year period or so
or 23 year period, we didn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic, we had a little bit of bud kill,
but not a significant winter injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this really allowed our
vinifera wine industry to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1980, I think we had around 20 or 22
wineries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have, I think it's about 300
now in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of them, most of them really have
been interested in growing premium wine
[SPEAKER_02]: grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think these winter warming trends
that we've had have been really quite
[SPEAKER_02]: positive for the grape and wine industry
in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an example of one of the
positives of climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're on the cold side, you will see
some positives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and then of course, that was the
winter, we can look at the length of the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing season, a similar way of showing
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it is increasing, it's not quite
as dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And easy to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look for the oranges and the
reds, clearly you're seeing more of those
[SPEAKER_02]: in the later years, somewhat less of the
blues and greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the season has been getting somewhat
longer as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the warmth of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really, are the seasons getting
warmer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, comparing the same way,
yes, it appears that they're getting more
[SPEAKER_02]: of the oranges and reds coming into New
York.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the warming going at the
Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the finger lakes are getting warmer
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get quite a bit of evidence that says
we're growing seasons are getting somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: longer, getting somewhat warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winters are getting quite a bit
warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these have had some significant
effects, we believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now one other thing that a lot of times we
don't really talk about is such the CO2 in
[SPEAKER_02]: the atmosphere, obviously is one of the
drivers for climate change and that it
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbs infrared heat being re-radiated
from the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's a greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also has direct effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that's very striking
is how rapidly the carbon dioxide is going
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when I came, if you follow this 320
parts per million line over right about
[SPEAKER_02]: just above the printing, it was,
when I arrived, I bought an infrared gas
[SPEAKER_02]: analyzer as part of my startup money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started measuring the CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 320 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's 380 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a 60 part per million change
in the atmosphere of CO2 just since I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been measuring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the point is that the atmosphere is
changing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm that old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think some might think I
should be measuring in geologic time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just the rapidity of the change
in the CO2 is just astounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just a comparison, I just went back
and I circled that change that occurred
[SPEAKER_02]: over like 35 years versus one of the
changes during way back when and they
[SPEAKER_02]: estimate that it maybe took 50,000 years
to have a similar type of change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point is, it's not only going up
and it's higher than it's ever been,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's going up fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not something that we can
ignore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does have some, there can be some
positive effects of that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, we'll see, it's gonna be a
good news to add to this type of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they know what drove the CO2 down in
that earlier time?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to ask Degatano.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's volcanic activities and a lot of
geological stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, I don't really know all the
reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, they also are, besides temperatures,
the rainfall has been changing somewhat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually hasn't been increasing
slightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, the increases when you have a
warming period and a cold area like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: the increases in precipitation tend to be
in the spring and the fall because in
[SPEAKER_02]: March or in October, November,
when in the past it might freeze and be
[SPEAKER_02]: quite dry conditions and some snow,
if it's warmer, the lakes stay warmer and
[SPEAKER_02]: you tend to get more rainfall that period.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summers tend to not change quite as
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, there's a little bit of a
trend in precipitation being similar or
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing somewhat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tendency has been in a couple
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that it's tended to be more erratic
rainfall, so heavy rainfall, so two inch
[SPEAKER_02]: type of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have the same amount of
total rain, but you're getting it in fewer
[SPEAKER_02]: major heavy downpours, then you may be
expecting to have more drops in between if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting the same amount of rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you have a heavy downpour,
a lot of time to get a lot of runoff,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the rain may not be as effective as
more frequent small amounts of rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing we need to be aware of
for the future is that it's expected to
[SPEAKER_02]: have that trend continue more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, snowfall has declined by,
or it says as much as 20 inches in some
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know around here talking to people that
have lived here all their life,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've seen quite dramatic drop-offs in
the amount of snowfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in some of the lake effect areas,
they tend to get increased rainfall
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the lake surface temperatures
warming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And providing more heat, more humidity for
the lake effect snows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the totals are really not changing
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it seems as though we've been
getting more droughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a long-term, more of a
meteorological estimate of droughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, anything above the line
is a drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything below the line is more of a wet
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, there was a period in the 1930s,
that one highest peak I think was 33,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was an extreme drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dustfall, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those tended to correlate with the warmer
temperatures at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I believe is related to a high solar
activity at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the solar activity is really at
one of the lows now, apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this plot only goes to about 1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the next 13 years, we continue to
have significant droughts off and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more erratically, we hardly have any
average years lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tended to be cold and wet,
or hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do expect that we're going to have
continued erratic weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will have droughts, and we will have
floods, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that hasn't been
occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the anomaly really is the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were hardly any droughts at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a relatively cool and wet period
throughout that whole decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what have been some of the
impacts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned a few, but I did list that the
premium wine industry, which is based on
[SPEAKER_02]: the cold tender varieties like Cabernet
and Chardonnay, have really been able to
[SPEAKER_02]: expand greatly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the expansion has been supported
by better research on learning how to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the vines for better cold tolerance,
and how to prune them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or wait and not prune.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe a lot of it's been allowed
to occur because of the climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloom dates are tending to get earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving somewhat longer growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our fruit crops are crops that are
able to take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants, you plant them, and 80,
90 days or whatever, they're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you have a longer growing
season, you really don't take advantage of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our crops make perennials come out as soon
as they can in the spring, and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: really day length controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the fall, if you have a nice long
fall, they just keep their leaves and they
[SPEAKER_02]: keep functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really the places that have the
highest yields are the ones that have the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest growing seasons because our apples
and grapes are able to adapt to the length
[SPEAKER_02]: of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really advantage of our crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also apple trees have been looked at
dry matter production and potential
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really are able to take advantage
of long growing seasons, such as New
[SPEAKER_02]: Zealand, where they can typically produce
almost twice as much fruit per hectare as
[SPEAKER_02]: we can in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're able to do this primarily
through the extended growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so now of course, some of the warmer
seasons and the droughts, not only
[SPEAKER_02]: drought, but a cool drought doesn't have
nearly the effect as a hot drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get warmer, warmer years,
and then you get droughts on top of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect is even stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had more years with some drought
symptoms occurring, at least in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 or 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the need for irrigation or
growers have been putting irrigation in or
[SPEAKER_02]: wishing they had irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that can be quite good though for red
wine varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cabernet family don't do very well when
it's really moist and humid during the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the drought years are the years that we
get really nice red Cabernet types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just in China, America, talk to you
all about some of the reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a mixture of things that are
happening because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's look at some examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the date of apple bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are from about 1965 or so up until
the present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see as with any biological
responses, it's quite variable because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're responding to the climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, there's been a very
significant trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: The range of change has been about eight
days over that 40 year period or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a quite market increase or earlier
bloom of apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we're expecting that to
continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Fredonia, where the conquered bloom
dates were collected from a one experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: that Nelson Shaw set out will continue and
Terry Bates have continued.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are actually data from the same
exact plants for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you can see the trend is quite
clear, not quite as much five and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: days or so over that time period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's because grapes bloom
about a month later than apples and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: more into the summer, which hasn't been
warming quite as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, still a fairly clear trend for
climate based responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I mentioned the CO2, that is not only
adds to the climate, the heating issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also used by plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have done some studies with our
whole canopy balloon chambers here where
[SPEAKER_02]: we can CO2 enrich them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done some CO2 response curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these are short term responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of different plants will show a
similar type of response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many plants when they're growing at higher
CO2 levels down regularly because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really not able to utilize that extra
carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they tend to down regulate the
photosynthesis so that they don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: see a dramatic effect in the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not really been able to do the
free air CO2 enrichment studies that need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be done with our fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, plants that have a lot of
sinks that can adapt and if you can add
[SPEAKER_02]: sinks to take advantage of the extra
carbon, those plants tend to respond much
[SPEAKER_02]: better to long term carbon dioxide
enrichment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing about, especially
with apples, the number of apples are set
[SPEAKER_02]: early in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during that time of the season when
they're really being set and the final
[SPEAKER_02]: crop numbers are being established,
that's the time when the plant is under
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done some, we've done some
shorter term studies with CO2 enrichment
[SPEAKER_02]: or even injection of sorbitol into the
trees and been able to cause a very
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic increase in the set of those
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're expecting that apples will
respond quite well to the extra carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: because the carbon is limiting at the time
they set the sinks and there's lots and
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of extra sinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually a commercial crop may only be five
to 10% of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a lot of extra sink capacity
that we can add.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that increased yields due to
the increased CO2 may be a very
[SPEAKER_02]: significant factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the increase just, as I mentioned,
from 320 to 380 is enough to really
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the photosynthesis of the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from our models, we'd suggest that
there should have been some increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit set and yields just over the last 30
or 40 years due to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course we don't have a real
experiment to prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think these crops again are ones
that are likely to respond to the climate
[SPEAKER_02]: in some ways and some positive ways too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go through all of the
climate change information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave Wolf covered a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Art is going to talk also.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those that didn't hear,
Dave, just a few slides to sort of set the
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been several studies on the
report of the Northeast Climate Impact
[SPEAKER_02]: Assessments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're available online at
climatechoices.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've done a lot of work and
Dave's been a key contributor to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's climatechoices.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're interested in grapes,
there was a nice article in the Practical
[SPEAKER_02]: Winery magazine by Kay Dillon Fields that
gives a good review and summary of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the climate models run in
different scenarios.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to go into all those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically a lot of the comparisons
that they show here were done with the
[SPEAKER_02]: lower emission scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's basically saying that we
actually wake up as a society and we stop
[SPEAKER_02]: cranking all this extra CO2 into the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we level it out and maybe eventually
bring it down then by the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: century.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, we really behave
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the higher one in red is if sort
of business as usual, keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on this, there's been about,
we mentioned about two degrees warming
[SPEAKER_02]: since 1970, just until today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with a good lower emissions scenario,
because of the inertia of something like
[SPEAKER_02]: this massive as our oceans and climate,
they still expect to see something around
[SPEAKER_02]: a four to six degree type of increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even at least doubling of what we've
already seen recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the higher scenario,
which I think is almost being shown to be
[SPEAKER_02]: not as high as it even should be,
is more in the six, eight, 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which of course is a huge change in our
climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're using these to sort of bracket
what we think would be the best and worst
[SPEAKER_02]: case scenarios.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they use this type of illustration.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from those publications I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are basically saying in yellow,
on the left is upstate New York and on the
[SPEAKER_02]: right is the New York City region.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at upstate from the historical
climate in our position there,
[SPEAKER_02]: that by the end of the century with the
best case scenario, we're probably going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be more like Virginia in climate in
terms of temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course with the business as
usual high emission scenario, we'd be more
[SPEAKER_02]: down into South Carolina, Georgia,
Atlanta kind of conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 60 to 80 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's within some lifetimes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of a scary scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now of course it's greatly simplified
because the climate won't be exactly that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this just gives an idea of the type of
range when you start talking about those
[SPEAKER_02]: changes and what if you look to see
climates that have those types of climates
[SPEAKER_02]: see where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is also some data from Art about
showing in the outline in red is the
[SPEAKER_02]: historic area for snowfall and snow cover
during the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the white shows again late 60,
80 years from now the type of areas that
[SPEAKER_02]: will have snow cover with their
predictions and with the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the exact implications of this a
little bit hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases snowfall and snow cover is
particularly helpful for perennial plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to, especially for some of the
wine grapes to be able to cover base of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can't depend on it, but if it does
cover the plant, it is a very good
[SPEAKER_02]: insulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may help us survive those few really
cold spells that we do get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like we're not going to be
able to depend on that in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty dramatic change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's one of those sort of
tipping point things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take too many degrees of change
to go from snow to rain and change the
[SPEAKER_02]: snow cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also been some, I just saw today
some data on ice on the Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though it still varies a lot,
in the last, in the 2000s there have been
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a few years where there's very,
very little ice formed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can remember on Seneca Lake in the
70s, it actually freezing all the way down
[SPEAKER_02]: to Dresden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now probably the grass students here
have been here several years, probably
[SPEAKER_02]: have not seen any ice at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there have been really dramatic changes
in the lakes also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they're very large bodies
to change very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I mentioned that it'll be warmer,
but there'll also be spikes, not only cold
[SPEAKER_02]: spikes, but hot spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so New York City is the hottest place
basically in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're very concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this plot that are provided shows
the number of days per year of the main
[SPEAKER_02]: plot over 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, on the left, the 1961 to 90
long-term, and then the different lower
[SPEAKER_02]: and higher emission scenarios showing
dramatic increases in the numbers of days
[SPEAKER_02]: over 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the inset just shows that they're
expecting days over 100 to maybe go from a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days per year to maybe late in
the season with the high emission scenario
[SPEAKER_02]: that was 25, almost a month over 100
degree temperatures in New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has some really major implications
for the city and the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just looked back and this summer in
Central Park had 34 days over 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were 17 days in July that
were over 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in Central Park, so it's not
like at an airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of pavement either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're expecting to see extremes and
also obviously extremes out in the country
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, the annual precipitation,
this is a plot showing the types of
[SPEAKER_02]: variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that's a lot more
difficult to predict because predicting
[SPEAKER_02]: clouds and rainfall is a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did some averages and basically
they're showing for this region that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not going to be a dramatic change.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a gradual increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think over that time it looks like it's
maybe getting up in that 10 to 15% at most
[SPEAKER_02]: type of increase in yields of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think primarily spring and
fall as we get into the warmer winters and
[SPEAKER_02]: less snowfall than it turns into rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not going to be seeing a lot of
reduction in rainfall that some other
[SPEAKER_02]: regions have been seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, they're predicting,
as we have been seeing, greater heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: rainfalls and then maybe dry periods in
between.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so let's talk about some of the
impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about some and we'll talk a
little bit more and project more in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, some of the main factors would be
warmer winters.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the implications of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: More droughts, heavy rain, longer growing
seasons, higher CO2 in the air,
[SPEAKER_02]: and likely with warmer winters,
more pests and disease pressures and
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we won't be killing off during the
winter as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look at a few examples and see
what we might be expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them are extensions of what we
have seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it might be two or three fold,
the effect that we've been looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: With warmer winters, obviously,
we may be able to grow warmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: more tender varieties, especially in the
wine grape area.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York is becoming a very well-known
wine producing area now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the expansion, there's a great
future for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to have a wider range of
grapes that can be grown here will be very
[SPEAKER_02]: positive for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in the shorter term, we may
eventually get to the point where we never
[SPEAKER_02]: have any real winter kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in many places, but in the shorter
term, we may have this sort of up and down
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a warmer winter, but because we
may have warmer periods during the winter,
[SPEAKER_02]: the vines may deacclimate some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even if it's warmer, we may still
get winter injury, not because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature so much as because of the fact
that we've had deacclimating periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already seen this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just some plots from Nelson,
excuse me, Martin Gavonet, about the bud
[SPEAKER_02]: acclimation for Cabernet, Riesling,
and Concord over a couple different years,
[SPEAKER_02]: just showing the general pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see in the top part here,
the same general pattern of the grapes,
[SPEAKER_02]: these would be the temperature pretty sure
these are LT50 or the temperatures in
[SPEAKER_02]: which 50% of the buds will kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see on the top graph that as
you go down through the season,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some differences in the varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you notice they compare Concord and
Cabernet, Cabernet on top is quite a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: slower to get to its maximum hardiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you follow down out by January and
February, they're really not as different.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you might expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But during the early part of the season,
Cabernet is more tender.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a little bit hard to follow the
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you follow them, when they come out
of the winter and the spring, the Concord
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out more quickly and the Cabernet is
a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it shows that there's some different
patterns of acclimation, acclimation and
[SPEAKER_02]: deacclimation that could be quite
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we have certain weather
patterns and we can have varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: better suit or are less responsive to
those warm periods, that may be quite
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the bottom plot just shows the
temperatures were going along and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they really dropped dramatically and they
hit a point where the Cabernets were
[SPEAKER_02]: killed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they hadn't really equilibrated yet
and so the other Concords and Rieslings
[SPEAKER_02]: were able to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we saw that in this example in a
couple different years.
[SPEAKER_02]: One that I mentioned was 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2004 was the January part of this plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the dark blue, you can see these
are the daily minimum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were bouncing along in
November, December or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 1994, which was a year that we got
almost, we were in a degree or two of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same cold temperature at the very end down
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could see that in the period
before the coldest temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: the minimum temperatures really never got
above freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were always fairly consistently cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the vines didn't deacclimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they did have the minus 13 or 14,
there was bite kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't a major catastrophe for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in 2004, the blue line, you can see
that the period just before the coldest
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, these are the minimums and a
lot of those days didn't even get to
[SPEAKER_02]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had an abnormally warm period for a
significant amount of time, almost three
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it took about four or five days
and it just went through the floor and hit
[SPEAKER_02]: minus 15, minus 16 depending where you
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was massive fine kill and
tremendous impact on the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the minimum temperatures at the
very bottom weren't dramatically
[SPEAKER_02]: different, but it was the warming of the
period before the cold that really got to
[SPEAKER_02]: us in 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're expecting that until the climate
warms up quite a bit more that there may
[SPEAKER_02]: be some of these years in between where we
might actually see killing at even a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher temperature than we normally see
just because of these deacclimating
[SPEAKER_02]: periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a concern for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really a lot you can do about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically tend to wait until as late as
possible into March and April to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: pruning so that you can remove canes and
cut the buds to look at some and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage of them are still alive and
then you can adjust the pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But typically we do that pretty much as a
normal procedure now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that we think is
likely to happen before we get completely
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the winter kill type of climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, if you have milder
winters, then some of the pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases that are killed back by our
winters in grapes, Pearson's disease for
[SPEAKER_02]: example, and there's a lot of other
diseases and pests that are to the south
[SPEAKER_02]: of us and they don't normally make it
through our winters here are likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will tend to increase our pesticide
loads probably because we're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: to deal with those additional bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that we have now probably are not
going to go away because the winter is
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may actually maybe survive even
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a real concern about the warmer
climate is the increased pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide load.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just an example showing the kudzu,
which we always think of as a real
[SPEAKER_02]: southern type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are basically the main point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't go through all the details,
but it's the they relate to the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: days below minus 20 Celsius that is really
sort of a completely kills kudzu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the point is that kudzu is
going to be able to move north if our
[SPEAKER_02]: climate continues to warm this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of grapevines growing all over
our trees, they might be fighting with the
[SPEAKER_02]: kudzu in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a real concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of the timing of the seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned that the grapes and things or
the apples are blooming earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, this is not only just for our
crops, but for other plants in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, it would be arriving one to two
weeks earlier if it's a lower emission
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario and maybe up to three weeks
earlier by 68 years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be quite positive for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the longer growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growing season is expected to extend
longer because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the issues, though, is if we start
getting earlier budbrain, are we going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have more frost injury because of that
earlier budbrain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you some data there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we expect to have
more summer if we're getting longer on
[SPEAKER_02]: both ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: This issue of spring frost, we went back
and looked over that same period of time
[SPEAKER_02]: that I showed you the apple data from
Geneva, and we looked for the last 28
[SPEAKER_02]: degree Fahrenheit minus two Celsius
temperatures in the spring because plant
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues don't freeze at zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take a couple degrees below zero to
freeze the super cooling and the solutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did plot the line above is the same
regression I showed you from the apple
[SPEAKER_02]: bloom, and then the regression down below
is for the last 28 degree frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that the last frost is getting
earlier and earlier in the year as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the rate of change is somewhat
faster than the rate of change in the
[SPEAKER_02]: apple bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 days over the 40 years versus eight or
eight and a half days, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't necessarily look like we're
going to be expecting more frost than
[SPEAKER_02]: average.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the difficult ones to
predict is many times the frosts occur
[SPEAKER_02]: because of clear skies and radiation
frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But trying to predict radiation and
cloudiness is something that's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that one has a huge error bar,
and climatologists are saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I don't try to get anything too
specific on that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, it doesn't look like
frosts are staying the same in our crops
[SPEAKER_02]: we were getting earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to be going along pretty much
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so then if we have a warmer summers,
here's a study saying, okay, for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: premium wine grapes, and these would be in
the relatively cool to moderate warmth
[SPEAKER_02]: growing season, which is a fairly
simplified way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a study done where they
looked to see what were the likely changes
[SPEAKER_02]: in climates that are suitable for that
type of growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, I'm going into a lot of
detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you move to the right, you can see
that, say on the upper left, the areas
[SPEAKER_02]: that are suitable, they show a lot in
California, Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that area, Central Valley, California
does have a lot of grapes, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: just saying it's not, it's not optimal for
premium quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Chardonnay type of condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but in the future, they're expecting
California to really have very restricted
[SPEAKER_02]: areas that will be more of the Napa Valley
or Mendocino or Sonoma type of conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the upper right hand corner,
you can see that they're really expecting
[SPEAKER_02]: the northeast to be one of the areas that
is benefited by the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, again, it's a very simplified
approach, which I don't want to be too
[SPEAKER_02]: much into it, but it does suggest that we
may be able to benefit where other places
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be excessively hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, besides just looking at the general
trends and doing some qualitative
[SPEAKER_02]: estimates of what might be going on,
we did try to use our carbon balance
[SPEAKER_02]: models that we've been developing,
one for grape and apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a simulation that we did with
our Vitacem grape model, where we looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at the simulated daily CO2 fixation and
daily respiration per vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the heavy black line,
the black lines, you can see is the top
[SPEAKER_02]: lines are the photosynthesis and the lower
ones are the respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the black line is taking an average of
a current year that was a quite average
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put together, we pulled some months
out from different years that had an
[SPEAKER_02]: average average, average mean temperature,
but we wanted to keep that variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just using a flat mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is sort of our current situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we added five degrees Celsius to
see what would happen with a five degree
[SPEAKER_02]: warming of the average, but we kept that
same variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see several things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, obviously, as we got warmer,
we didn't necessarily see any higher
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum photosynthesis of the plants,
because we're in our summer is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: close to optimum as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you did see a difference is that
because we had a warmer growing season,
[SPEAKER_02]: the trees get started earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you end up with a longer growing
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the red line has shifted off to the
right later part of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can pick up extra dry matter
production there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, the warmer conditions lead
to more respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see on the red lines,
there are more days that have really
[SPEAKER_02]: suboptimal photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: These would be the heat spikes that we'd
be expecting to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using the simulation models to
try to look at some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is just sort of a summary then
on the top showing that between those two
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons, we suggested that they're added
up to about a 20% increase in the total
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis, about a 35% increase in
the respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the respiration flow,
so taking the difference, we got about 10
[SPEAKER_02]: to 12% or so increase in accumulated dry
matter by having that extra five degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's some positive effect, but it's not
a dramatic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a summary then would be that with that
warmer year, we'll reach those
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures for bud break about two weeks
earlier than normal and end up with a four
[SPEAKER_02]: to five week longer season.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be some more photosynthesis,
but because of the increased respiration,
[SPEAKER_02]: the net effect is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real concerns though are possibly not
averages, but those heat spikes that may
[SPEAKER_02]: be very detrimental to food quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're seeing a lot of this a lot
more in places like Australia where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting heat spikes and it's
really causing some problems with quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, there's probably a net
positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be some episodes that may be a
concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what about the situation with
more heavy rains and then maybe drops in
[SPEAKER_02]: between?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that suggests that we probably need
sites that will have both excellent
[SPEAKER_02]: drainage and good water supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you go to a really well-drained
site, a lot of times you're short of
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have a site that holds a lot of
water, you get a lot of heavy rains,
[SPEAKER_02]: you may be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely we'll need very good erosion
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll probably have to use cover crops
to be able to stabilize the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those will tend to use water also in
between times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the best sites especially for
grapes will be sites that will be very
[SPEAKER_02]: highly drained, but be sure to have
irrigation system with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many ways that actually is a
simulation of some of the very best
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyards in the world that produce the
best quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely well-drained, but then they
naturally have deep roots, they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: supply of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe we have to artificially use
that approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, some of the other things though is
that with more retic precipitation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you also get more retic rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you have droughts, typically
you've got more sunny conditions because
[SPEAKER_02]: the air is dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's wet, you've got to have
clouds to reduce that precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many crops don't particularly respond
that much to say a three or four day
[SPEAKER_02]: period that might have a heavy rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, grapes and apples really can respond
quite strongly to short periods,
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example of just like a heat
spike, where we can look back in our own
[SPEAKER_02]: current data, and this is just showing in
Geneva, the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is right in that critical period
for apple sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right at the end of May, early June,
and we had, it's a little bit difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: see, but there were actually about five
days above 80 or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very warm nights in the 60s or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that type of four or five day heat
spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can cause significant reduction in that
fruit set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if the grower is applying a
chemical thinner right at that time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have some dramatic loss of fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Uruguay recently, and about a
year ago, they had a very heavy set of
[SPEAKER_02]: apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just before they were going to thin,
they had four cloudy days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't rain all that much, but it was just
before really cloudy days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a massive drop of fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a tremendous drop, and it caused not
only problems for the growers in not
[SPEAKER_02]: having the crop they needed, but also all
that thinning was done by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it threw a tremendous number of
people out of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of sociological issues
that came up because of that one four day
[SPEAKER_02]: cloudy period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the growers didn't even notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you think about
normally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that is, when you get
more erratic weather, more episodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: this could be a real issue for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet the climate modelers say we can't
predict that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too difficult.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, CO2 on the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used for photosynthesis, so there
should be increased possibility for dry
[SPEAKER_02]: matter yield, especially in our crops that
can take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: May help with water use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times the stonemates close
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to the CO2, even though you're getting
more photosynthesis, you may be getting
[SPEAKER_02]: less or not much more increase in water
loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water use efficiency may be improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effects on apple and wine quality
is really not very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one study with grapes,
and they found more yield of a similar
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't really see too much effect,
but they didn't really go into flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big question mark for the
grape side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there has been work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ziska has done a lot of work where he had
CO2 enrichment plots, and he found that
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds seemed to respond much better to CO2
than crops in many cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they found that the weed pressure
dramatically increased with high CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this may lead to higher
herbicide loads and concerns that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some of the things that we can
try to do to adapt to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Adapting to this unavoidable change,
it's going to require a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: flexibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the key issues are we need to
understand how soil variability may
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with the climate variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned about the water crops and
heavy rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand what the CO2 is
likely to mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really needs long-term CO2
enrichment studies, which are very
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they were done with the primary
grain crops, then it became not
[SPEAKER_02]: fashionable anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is one free air CO2 enrichment
project going on in Kaisernheim,
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have grapes and some apples,
I believe, in there also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be good to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to think more about and
study a little more about the winter
[SPEAKER_02]: hardiness responses of these different
wine cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even if we could grow some of them,
they may have a response that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the annotated, we can shift to
better adapted varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that's a fairly obvious one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeders ultimately tell us,
well, we can solve everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we'll breed better varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But especially in the wine grape area,
people want Cabernet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want Geneva Selection 43,
as such.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot harder when you have named
known varieties to change that genotype
[SPEAKER_02]: blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other plants that people don't care about
the variety can change much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be looking also at maybe
sites that are going to limit or reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects of the bad components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we may need to try to adapt crop
management, since we're not changing
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes, but we do a lot of crop
management with these crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, I think probably most of you were
here for Greg Jones' talk, and he gave us
[SPEAKER_02]: a plot showing the average growing season
temperatures and where the different
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties seem to fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The line, the dashed line on the left is
where Geneva is currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finger legs, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that it goes pretty much
right through Riesling, Pinot Noir,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Chardonnay is pretty good,
and we're a little bit cool for Sauvignon
[SPEAKER_02]: Blanc, Simeon, and Cab Franc is right at
the edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you go down, they're really
not very feasible to grow some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: other varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I put the second line to the right
two-degree change, and you can see that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a pretty significant change in the
potential varieties, but a four-degree
[SPEAKER_02]: change is going to push even further.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the level of change that we're talking
about is enough to really make us want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be looking in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something we have to do right
away, which is good because we have little
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but we will have an opportunity to
grow some of the things that we can't now.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we may be out of the region
that's optimum for the things that we do
[SPEAKER_02]: well at Riesling, signature varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burgundy is almost getting too warm for
its own signature variety of Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a concern for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is at any one location,
if you have topography, you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not all sides of a hill have the
same environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is in Germany where they've
planted a very, very steep south-facing
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyard to change the sun angle so that
it would be more equivalent to,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, in, say, Burgundy, France.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is one approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually been finding that it has,
it's been getting too warm, and so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: almost not optimum anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we may do is
here, we're on the cool side, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing things on to, you know,
better, better exposures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in the future, from that red line,
we might be wanting to go from the south
[SPEAKER_02]: side with these varieties, and maybe on
Riesling, bring it around to the north
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ski slopes are on north-facing
slopes for good reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we may be able to
actually just go around the hill and try
[SPEAKER_02]: to get away from some of the warming that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may be one adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of different things,
maybe changing the floor management,
[SPEAKER_02]: as mentioned, the rainfall, but also
drought, you know, putting in irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and gradually do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, if it's cool, we're trying to
remove leaves to get the fruit into the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun to warm it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In warm places, they're happy to leave the
leaves over top of the fruit to shade
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are manipulating the climate within
the plant, and so that gives us some
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility of, again, manipulating it in
a way to counteract the detrimental
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, we're, I'm sure, got a little
bit long here, but just some closing
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts on, you know, future and what
research thinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that, I mean, we certainly need to
get a better understanding of crop
[SPEAKER_02]: responses to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a lot of work over the
years, but in many cases, it hasn't been
[SPEAKER_02]: the interactions between the components of
the environment that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, whenever you're trying to
look into the future, you can't do that
[SPEAKER_02]: with experiments very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to use models more to
understand how the plants work and then
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're likely to respond to those
changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think models that have gotten a bad
reputation over the years, I think we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have to, you know, use them more
and also understand what their limitations
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's, if you look to the future,
there's not a lot of choices without using
[SPEAKER_02]: models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also there's a lot more outside
influences.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be carbon, you know, carbon
credits and things like that that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, may be positive or negative,
depending on the carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to understand how those things
will impact the environment as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: just the plants in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think there's a lot of new
technologies out and new ways of looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at things that the growers are having to
be a lot more aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And issues of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consumer is looking for things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more things about carbon
reduction labeling and those sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these will have big impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a bit late, but I'd be happy to
answer any questions that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question is, do we have a table for apple
varieties similar to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't actually put it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, certainly in our head,
we sort of know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly Macintosh is a very cool season
of apple variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do well even in the lower
Hudson Valley so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly not down south of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we sort of have a concept,
but I haven't seen anyone actually put
[SPEAKER_02]: that into a table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: If a guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: When Greg Jones was here, he talked about,
in grapes at least, the bud grape was
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, but there was also a compression
of the stages so that a more rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: development moving through the different
phenological stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I understood him right,
it wasn't actually extending the season
[SPEAKER_01]: for ripenings in the grapes because the
maturation went more quickly at the high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see anything like that in apples
where instead of getting the longer season
[SPEAKER_01]: that you predict is possible because of
frost-free days, just more rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: maturation brings, you know, the apple
crop needs to be harvested earlier?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, the stages of development
tend to be all pushed somewhat forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's several aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that if you're in the spring,
so bud grape to bloom, something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that tends to be driven by degree
days because they're a fairly cool time of
[SPEAKER_02]: the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will tend to be compressed if you
have a warmer period, except by moving
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier in the season, you're always
starting about the same temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's when the tree senses it's
the right temperature to begin to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless you start earlier and have a
more rapid warm-up, if the warm-up rate is
[SPEAKER_02]: the same, then you wouldn't expect to see
that period shorten very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I haven't seen a lot of evidence
saying that the period from, say,
[SPEAKER_02]: bud grape to bloom is going to get
dramatically shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tends to be more about maritime will
be a longer period because it's a slower
[SPEAKER_02]: warm-up and a continental climate will
tend to be a more rapid one because it
[SPEAKER_02]: heats up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, I don't necessarily expect to
see the difference in that period to be
[SPEAKER_02]: that much different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just everything shifted forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: The period with apple, there tends to be a
model that was developed in Lampede here
[SPEAKER_02]: at Cornell, found that the temperatures
after bloom during the cell division
[SPEAKER_02]: period tend to set the number of days to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the middle of the season,
the degree days don't always control
[SPEAKER_02]: growth very well because a lot of times
you're right at sort of a maximum of
[SPEAKER_02]: response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a few degree days one way or
another doesn't affect things too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think generally we expect to see bud
grape earlier, bloom earlier, not
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically different, harvest somewhat
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from bud grape to harvest,
I don't really think we're seeing very
[SPEAKER_02]: much change in that period except
everything has shifted forward in the case
[SPEAKER_02]: of apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the limitations of our climate
for our fruit crops is the post-harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some years we've actually
harvested fruit with snow on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's almost no time at all for the
vines to recover, for buds or apples to
[SPEAKER_02]: recover, just to develop additional
reserves, additional root growth after
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that post-harvest period is
where you're going to see the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: effect of the climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a period that allows the vines
and the trees to recover from the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to be able to help the crop
set more fruit the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I'm still not sure whether
we're seeing that type of compression with
[SPEAKER_02]: the types of changes that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any evidence for heat stress in
vines or apples that entails growth in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the season or you get these days
above 90 or up, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen some cases where we have seen
actually sort of bleaching of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a very hot spell with our
grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the photosynthesis rate was reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fairly significant, about 20 or
30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that tended to state there wasn't a
recovery to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes, and I know in areas of
Central Valley and California,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get real heat spells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vine basically shuts down and really
doesn't produce very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get delayed ripening because of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think there's a few studies
that have been looking, trying to document
[SPEAKER_02]: that a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been a lot of observations by
growers over the years that those heat
[SPEAKER_02]: spells not only cause a problem right at
that time, but they can cause problems in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of longer term problems of hurting
the leaf function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there can be some clear effects
of those heat spells.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
