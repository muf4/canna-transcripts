[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm Troy Bilding, visiting
associate professor in Matt's laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about,
here are my topics and objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
agriculture in Brazil and also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into a little bit about
cover crops, the actual situation right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and then the need for cover crops in
agricultural systems in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about an analysis of pearl
millet, a meta-analysis, rather,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished the first draft on the use
of pearl millet in the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll get into some present and future
work in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll have the closing comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably, as many of you know,
Brazil is an agricultural leader in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The country was a net importer of food
grains in the 70s, and it was considered
[SPEAKER_00]: to be sort of backward in terms of
agriculture, whereas now today it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agribusiness, I think in 2017,
was responsible for around 40% of exports
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe a third of GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, a large percentage of growth
in GDP comes from agribusiness in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at this figure here,
we can see that for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: commodities, the rank and world production
value increased during the period from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970 to 2017, increased quite a bit,
especially for chicken, for meat from
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle, soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil is one of the world's largest
exporters in all these products,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the larger producer and exporter
of oranges, coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a world leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production and total factor productivity
have more than doubled during this period,
[SPEAKER_00]: and part of that is due to the increase in
area of, especially soybeans, during the
[SPEAKER_00]: period from 1970 to 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area of soybeans increased 70%,
and corn increased by 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil's also a world leader in no-till
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here that, here we go,
the area under no-till in 2007 and 2008
[SPEAKER_00]: was about 25.5 million hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 65 million acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a 20% increase during about the
last 10 years, and today they have about
[SPEAKER_00]: 81 million acres under no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 70% of all cultivated land in Brazil
is under no-till agriculture, so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really something that Brazilian farmers
are sold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really believe that no-till is one of
the foundations to make agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to explain a little bit about
how things have changed in recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the savanna, or sahado,
in Portuguese, biome, or ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where a lot of this increase in
agriculture has occurred in Brazil and
[SPEAKER_00]: still is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge area, larger than California
and Alaska combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the image here, that's in
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sahado.
[SPEAKER_00]: About half of it is deforested,
and there was a large increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural land use between 2000 and
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has happened is that farmers have
basically migrated from the south of
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil up through the sahado, and now
during the last 10, maybe 15 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers have migrated into the Amazon to
where I'm located.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered to be one of the
agricultural frontiers in Brazil today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capitalized farmers are making this
migration today due to, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: factors involved, but basically it has to
do with cheaper land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The geographic area, the focus of my talk,
of a lot of things I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: today, is Western Pará.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look here, this is the legal Amazon,
and then the state of Pará is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm located right about here in this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Tapajós River at the confluence
of the Amazon River, and then these areas
[SPEAKER_00]: in red show basically the region that I'm
referring to as Western Pará, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less this region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the most important, on a large
scale at least, agricultural activity in
[SPEAKER_00]: this region of the Amazon?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soybeans followed by corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that soybeans are planted
sometime usually around the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: December, beginning of January,
it depends on the year, the climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they're harvested sometime around
the end of April, mid-May, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the harvest, corn is planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the second crop corn,
or safrinha in Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows farmers to harvest two crops
on the same piece of land during one
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's planted immediately after the
soybeans are harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soybeans are harvested at the
beginning of May, just a couple days
[SPEAKER_00]: after, the corn is planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's harvested sometime around the
end of August, the beginning of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers can get two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at these dates, these periods of
time, these months, the question is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what about August, September through
December, January?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about that more or less four-month
period?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens then?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to talk about a
little bit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I wanted to put into context the
importance of agriculture to the economy
[SPEAKER_00]: in this region of the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here some statistics on the
production chain of soybeans and corn in
[SPEAKER_00]: this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry is responsible for about
5,000 direct, indirect jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 240,000 acres of soybeans
and corn planted every year in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's responsible for about $60 million
each year in financial transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This puts into context the magnitude of
what's going on in this agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land use change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some figures from a PhD student
with whom I worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here the dynamics of land use
change in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got three of the most important
municipalities in the region, Mojui,
[SPEAKER_00]: Belterra, and Santarém.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land use changed from 2001 to 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you'll see, land use change,
the direction of things is very different
[SPEAKER_00]: in each place.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, 61% during the period,
61% of land use change was forest and
[SPEAKER_00]: pasture to agriculture in Mojui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Belterra, 90% or more was forest
and agriculture going to pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in Santarém, 84% was forest that got
converted to agriculture and pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the reasons for this is it
has to do with prices for commodities on
[SPEAKER_00]: national and international markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers have the flexibility to,
year to year, they can turn a pasture into
[SPEAKER_00]: a soy field or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times what'll happen is if soy
prices go up, a farmer will rent out his
[SPEAKER_00]: land for two or three years to a
neighboring farmer that has the capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment and knowledge and everything
to grow soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting dynamic in the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a little bit about cover
crops here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's been going on in
the last few years there is interseeding
[SPEAKER_00]: of Congo grass as a cover crop mulch for
no-till planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we've got images from December of
this year, 2018, sorry, showing the dried
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo grass just before soybean planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that this grass is
interseeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either interseeded within the rows of
soybean just a few weeks before harvest or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interseeded into the second crop corn
when the corn gets to be maybe about 15
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of the Congo grass are that
it has a rapid establishment, that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: a high sensitivity to desiccation,
which is really good for no-till mulch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cattle can be grazed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After harvesting the second crop corn,
you can bring cattle in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest the second crop corn,
the grass will shoot right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cattle can come in, graze on that,
and also on the corn residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the disadvantages of the use of
Congo grass are that it has a high
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility to pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarinha is the name, I think,
spittle bug here, and has low drought
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I'm going to talk
about just in another slide coming right
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an image of no-till planting in
January this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Congo grass mulch with the
soybean being planted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about a month later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the mulch on the ground here
with soybeans growing quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the background, that's a castaneda.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Brazil nut tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'll see down there are these huge
fields that go out sometimes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon, and they'll be interspersed with
these lone, huge trees sitting all by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, the Brazil nut tree,
because you can't cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neat thing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for an interesting visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are with soybeans about two months
after planting, the end of March of this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, growing quite well, very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this image here, it makes you
think that the Congo grass really serves
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the case, but the thing is
that these guys, these farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are planting this Congo grass
based on what happens in Mato Grosso in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cerrado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's empirical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no experimental basis for this
just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads me, naturally, to conclude that
there are lots of unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, a great need for
diversification of cover crops in the
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, farms with no cattle don't
need to use pasture grass as cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other thing I thought about is,
does this Congo grass, does it make
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient biomass mulch for the no-till
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the effects of it on cash crop
yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it contribute to the yield of the
cash crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest resistance, potential for
intercropping, other uses such as seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use this as a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what about drought tolerance?
[SPEAKER_00]: In our region, that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to explain that here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate and water balance are going to be
really important in terms of decision
[SPEAKER_00]: making about what cover crops we're going
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here we've got an image of the
Brazilian Amazon with the Coppen
[SPEAKER_00]: classification colored in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a publication of colleagues
of mine from Embrapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Para, and the arrow points to where
I'm located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our region is a mix of AM3 and AM4,
so that means we get a pretty strong dry
[SPEAKER_00]: season in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here, looking at the water
balance, this figure that I made here from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990 to 2018, millimeters of rainfall and
average temperature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line is the average temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue is the rainfall, the green is the
excess, and then the red is the deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the figure, you can see the
available water deficit begins sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: around the end of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really strong for a couple of months
and then begins to diminish towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of December.
[SPEAKER_00]: This period is a really important moment
in terms of the agricultural year,
[SPEAKER_00]: the agricultural cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm going to talk about in
terms of cover crops here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another factor here that's really
important to take into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides our natural seasonal variation,
we're having problems with droughts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had droughts 2005, 10, and 15,
pretty severe droughts that appear to get
[SPEAKER_00]: longer in duration and more severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: These figures from a 2018 publication here
show monthly precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me first explain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dashed line is the 16-year average
from 2000 to 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solid line is what happened in 2015
and 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got monthly precipitation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By satellite and by rain gauges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both show a decrease of 16, 17% in
rainfall during the period 2015,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gauges showed a decrease of 16%
compared to the 115-year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, during December, January,
February of 2015-16, pastures caught on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire, roads sides were on fire,
forests caught fire, cattle were breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down barbed wire fences to get into
greener pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing this down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 0.7 degrees Celsius above the
16-year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vapor pressure deficit, same thing,
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the maximum climatological water
deficit shows a very large deficit that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically continued all the way through
this whole period.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, when the rains came
finally, there was still a large deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: because the deficit was so strong in the
previous months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing this and thinking about this made
me think that this shows that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great need for incorporation of
drought-resistant cover crops during the
[SPEAKER_00]: fallow period between cultivation of cash
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an image of the drought so we can
see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This demonstrates clearly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the drought, planting of soybeans
were delayed three months or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here at the end of May 2015,
we were doing a soil sampling on this day
[SPEAKER_00]: and soybeans were harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can see here about a year later,
May 12, 2016, soybeans were basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the drought, everything got
delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ended up happening is that the second
crop corn wasn't planted that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that farmers lost out
economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't plant, they didn't harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just that, there's an opportunity cost
involved, meaning that farmers left fields
[SPEAKER_00]: bare during the dry season when they could
have gone in there and planted some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cover crop that would have enhanced
soil fertility and brought other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't do it because of the drought,
so everything just laid bare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the concrete effects that
you can see right here due to droughts in
[SPEAKER_00]: the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the strong dry season and the
question of droughts requires the use of a
[SPEAKER_00]: drought-resistant cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the figure again,
a water balance figure here, millimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: of rainfall, temperature, we've got
rainfall, excess, and deficit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybeans are planted somewhere around the
end of December in a normal year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest occurs sometime in April,
mid-April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon afterward, the second crop is planted
and then the second crop is harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime generally in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us this period here,
what I call the window of opportunity when
[SPEAKER_00]: a drought-resistant cover crop could be
introduced to improve soil fertility and
[SPEAKER_00]: generate mulch for no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this period here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to also take into account climate
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate models demonstrate generally that
droughts will become more frequent,
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall will become more intense during
the wet season, and there'll be longer
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of dry periods with no rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking all this as a whole, thinking about
it, what might be an adequate species of
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop to put in this period here?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to say that the use
of cover crops in general across the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon is sort of insipid still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't really taken a hold just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this is this map from
Konabi, which is an agency that is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for generating statistics and
data about agricultural production in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from July 18, and it's for
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here in the great majority of
the Amazon region, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing for sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, though, I know for a fact
personally that there is sorghum plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Amazon in our region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it, know the farmers,
and I talked to the president from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rural syndicate in January, and he said he
knows the farmers, he knows the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, yeah, there's sorghum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a thousand hectares,
but there's sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a macro scale, you won't see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a more local scale, you'll find the use
of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the fall, I started thinking about
what it is I wanted to do in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: writing and researching something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I had an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll look at about 50 species of
cover crops and write about them and their
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for use in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became pretty evident very soon that
I couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started to narrow down my focus and
really think about what it is I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, it became obvious that even writing
about maybe three or four species would be
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate, some of the species I found
here are still sansis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it stilo in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be called pencil flower
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crotalaria, that's what they call it
there, about four species that are used in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun hemp is what I've seen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorghum, jack bean, a couple different
pasture grasses, and then pearl millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realizing that I could only use just one
species for this analysis I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: I opted to use pearl millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of the paper, the first draft
here, is the use of pearl millet as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop species in Amazonian
agroecosystems to promote sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, a descriptive meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why P. glaucum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically because it appears to have
characteristics that make it suitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: use in these systems down in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these characteristics are that
it's drought resistant, deep-rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a C4 plant, so it's adapted to
tropical biome systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's capable of a large biomass
production, which is important for
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nutrient recycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used as a grain or forage crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are relatively cheap and easily
available, and also because I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: know that this is being used in the region
in the Amazon, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be 1,000 hectares of it once
again, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the aspects then that I decided
to look at in terms of the use of pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: millet as a cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just focus on these four in
bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential for biomass generation,
residue decomposition, nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the effect on the cash crop yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also looked at some others, soil C
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percentage of soil coverage and weed
control, potential as a forage,
[SPEAKER_00]: cash, or seed crop, and drought
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overarching question here is,
what are the possible contributions to the
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience and the sustainability in
Amazonian agro-ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that I called this a
meta-analysis, a descriptive
[SPEAKER_00]: meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are familiar with
meta-analysis, you probably know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have a series of standard things
like risk of bias assessment, analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation among the studies that you use,
probably some statistical analyses to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gathered all the studies I could
find that fit my criteria, which I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to show, all the studies I could find,
and then just reported averages,
[SPEAKER_00]: made averages and reported variation of
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a few simple statistical tests,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the meta-analysis goes,
study inclusion criteria, that's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my criteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the study had to be
conducted in the Sahara or the Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to be done on an oxasol soil,
and it had to be done in the field with no
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the basic criteria that I used
to include, exclude studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I found very few studies done in the
Amazon, I think I found three,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used studies done on oxasol soils in the
Sahara as a proxy for conditions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really not that big of a stretch,
if you think about it, because both
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons have a really strong, both biomes
have a really strong dry season during
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the same months, and there are a
lot of oxasols there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the agriculture is done on
oxasols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quickly look at some data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry biomass generation, kilograms per
hectare here, on oxasols in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The studies I found were all between 95
and 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of studies here, looking at
Brazil as a whole, without regard to soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type, biome or anything, found 78 studies,
and the end here is larger than the
[SPEAKER_00]: studies because some studies had values
for these parameters, biomass here,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had several values from different
sites or different years, so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: included them as a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Found three studies for the Amazon and 43
for the Sahara.
[SPEAKER_00]: These values, to put it into context,
in the literature, what's established in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature is six megagrams here,
that's just 6,000 kilograms per hectare,
[SPEAKER_00]: as being necessary to establish no-till in
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our values here for the Sahara are well
above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Amazon, it approaches six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we only have three studies,
you have to take that as a grain of salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over half of the studies that I found for
the dry biomass were greater than six for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sahara and the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows that pearl millet has the
potential to create what can be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient dry biomass on these oxasol
soils in seasonally dry ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at nutrients in the
biomass, the dry biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have nutrient content at 0,
60, and 120 days after desiccation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for pearl millet that was grown
for 60 days and also grown for 180 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two different periods for which
it was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see here, kilograms per hectare,
is that basically for pearl millet grown
[SPEAKER_00]: for 60 days, nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium are greater than for pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: millet grown for 180 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more nutrients in these plants
when they're desiccated basically at
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering than if you let them mature and
set to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting result that I'll
explain a little more that has
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for management of pearl
millet in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what about release of the nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about release?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see that the release of NPK by
pearl millet biomass can be equal to the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that are exported in the cashew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at soybeans and corn,
the amounts of nutrients exported in four
[SPEAKER_00]: and six megagrams of these on oxasol soils
in the Serhado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see the nutrient content
that's released after 60 days of
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of these orange bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing these data from the studies I
gathered, we can see that pearl millet has
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential after 60 days of
decomposition to replace nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: are exported in soybeans and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty positive result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the half-life of biomass,
the studies had an average biomass of 36
[SPEAKER_00]: for the CN ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows that it's probably slower as
far as decomposition goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half-life is about 109 days, and then
nutrients at more or less the 60 here,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 days, the red line, nutrients are all
pretty much near 50% or more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty good result.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 60 days of decomposition,
there's still a lot of nutrients left in
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass, and there's also a lot that's
released to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good result for nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about transfer then to the soil,
the enrichment of the soil by the pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: millet biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have studies that had data for up
to 20 centimeters for nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred after 60 days of
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the studies I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pearl millet and the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no statistical difference in
the t-test I did here, but what we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: is that pearl millet is able to transfer
large amounts of nutrients to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about cultivation,
intensive cultivation on oxysols,
[SPEAKER_00]: low fertility oxysols, this is a important
result because sustainability of
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural activities on these soils is
going to partially be related to,
[SPEAKER_00]: be a function of rather, the ability of
plant species to absorb and efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: release nutrients in labile forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then more specifically, looking at the
phosphorus as transferred to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we've got a table now, phosphorus
availability for soils of the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pará.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Embrapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the percent clay and then the
soil texture, clay to sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have low to very high
concentrations of phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remembering that the average pea content
transferred to the soil from pearl millet
[SPEAKER_00]: was about 73 milligrams per decimeter
cubed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the table, we can see that
pearl millet has the potential to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: pea levels to very high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could, in theory, reduce the need for
the use of phosphorus fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember that oxysols on
the soil order, it is the soil order,
[SPEAKER_00]: has the highest capacity for fixation of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Amazon, 34% of the soils are
oxysols.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my region, they're more highly
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit north and then south of the
Amazon River in my region of western Pará,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a huge percentage of oxysols in
that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important result.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one caveat though, and that is
that these data, 73 here for phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: these data don't tell us anything about
the way that pearl millet accesses
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's able to access sources of
phosphorus that are considered moderately
[SPEAKER_00]: label and then leave them in more label
forms, which is really important for
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings up a research question,
which is basically, how can we improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of phosphorus in these
agricultural soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, are there plants such as
pearl millet that can mine phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Access forms that are moderately label
associated with iron and aluminum in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and then release it in label forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mechanism would be the release of
organic acid and ions by the roots into
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere, which would then compete
for P absorption sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting research question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those data that I gathered from the
studies don't tell us anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea would be to cultivate plants in
controlled experiments and then do a
[SPEAKER_00]: sequential fractionation to try to extract
different fractions of soil phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help us to understand the
capacity for pearl millet in this case to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect changes in the sources and reserves
of phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last data slide here, what are the effects
of pearl millet on cash crop yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have kilograms per hectare,
and I found studies on rice, soybeans,
[SPEAKER_00]: and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sample size is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find any statistical differences
with the simple t-tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual studies do show that there are
effects actually, especially for rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl millet does have an effect on yields
specifically associated with the input,
[SPEAKER_00]: recycling rather, of phosphorus and
potassium into the soil through the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a bunch of studies I saw that I
reported on show that this effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: increase of cash crop yield is only
possible with an input of inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways around that that I saw in
these studies that I gathered was the
[SPEAKER_00]: question of intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intercropping of pearl millet was species
of Crotolaria, sun hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the studies I saw on the
noxus halls in the Sahadl, this
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping resulted in higher yields,
higher soil fertility, higher yields of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cash crop too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of the interaction between
the end fixer, the sun hemp, and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits from the pearl millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty interesting result too,
the question of intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: To summarize some of this here,
the objective of the incorporation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop by a farmer is going to
determine, in this case, how pearl millet
[SPEAKER_00]: would be managed in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if the objective is just to
create biomass for mulch, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave it basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: 130 days or so is its cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it grows and matures even more,
it'll have a higher lignin concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be good for the biomass mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remembering our available water
balance figure here with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of planting and harvest of
soybeans in the second crop, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: question here that if the objective is not
just biomass generation but nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling, then the idea would be try to
synchronize the planting of pearl millet
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize not just biomass but nutrient
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the data that I was able to gather,
that looks to be about 60 days of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and 60 for decomposition, which fits
nicely into this period here of the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: season, the four months window during the
dry season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now transitioning to some present and
future work in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, here's a map showing,
once again, the legal Amazon with
[SPEAKER_00]: basically where I'm located right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is we've got a 30-hectare
plot of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a degraded pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a farm called Jaguara.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to do is create a model farm,
a demonstration farm, and an agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment research station on this farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner of this farm is a large animal
veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a university professor with me also.
[SPEAKER_00]: He specializes in bovine reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he wants to do is create an intensive
cattle raging system where you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: rotations between pastures and crops,
and you incorporate trees into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pastures and the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the integration crops, livestock,
and forest, which is a big deal right now
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Brazil, slowly taking on in the
Amazon region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our plot of land here,
degraded pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer is totally sold on the idea of
creating this project, this model farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually financed a good part of the
work we've been doing for the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really great opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea would be to create a system like
this, which exists in Patagonianas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a region far away in the state of
Pará, in the eastern part of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got trees here planted in rows with
crops between the trees and pastures with
[SPEAKER_00]: trees also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over time, you rotate all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of soybeans with
eucalyptus trees planted in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our idea is actually to see if we can't
plant on the topography following the
[SPEAKER_00]: contour lines in that 30 hectare plot of
land that I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image from a master student of
mine generated this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our idea, is to do things a little
bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general idea is this, is to create an
integrated system where you have crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: pastures being rotated, where you use
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can do experiments in these
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another experiment that just started this
year is attempting to say something about
[SPEAKER_00]: the contribution of no-till agriculture
compared to conventional agriculture in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that affect sustainability?
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is we have fields where no-till
agriculture, soybeans, planted right next
[SPEAKER_00]: to conventionally planted soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's replicated on five farms with the
same soil type and site history,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to look at crop
productivity, soil productivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and microclimate parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to say something about no-till and
Amazonian agroecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil fertility sampling, we did an
intensive campaign of two years of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling in different sites, five
different sites here in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated no-till crop pasture rotation,
integrated no-till crop pasture forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: a managed pasture, a degraded pasture,
and then native forest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years of data, three seasons within
each year, wet, dry, and transition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 720 total samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to show some quick photos here,
this is the no-till corn, soybean pasture
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is managed pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the integration of crops,
livestock, and forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That forest is noble species of wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahogany, Brazilian teak, and a bunch of
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't remember now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Degraded pasture, and then primary forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to just include this just
to show some of the things we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years of data here, three different
depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH in the managed sites has gone up
compared to the native forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then potential acidity here has gone
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison to the native forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of availability of nutrients,
nutrient cycling, that's a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing for cation exchange capacity,
base saturation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see our sites in the managed sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, cation exchange has gone up
compared to the forest, and also base
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, in terms of nutrient
cycling, we can consider that a positive.
Result.
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, now looking at
available soil phosphorus, what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the managed sites, no-till crop
pasture, and the crop livestock forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have two years of data showing there's
more available phosphorus in these sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 meters in the soil compared to the
other sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really interesting result when
you think about the problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus availability in the soil,
and also the question of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: a more geopolitical question of phosphorus
reserves in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll only get more difficult for
Brazil as time goes, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concluding here, I have no idea about
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clock right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to talk a little bit about
expansion here, and knowledge flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
what we do here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a group, together with people from
Ember Apple, which are part of our group,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do these sort of workshops where we'll
get out and talk to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I've seen here at
Cornell, in Matt Ryan's lab, that
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently they do really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get together with farmers in the field,
talk about their work, show research
[SPEAKER_00]: results, bring them here even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really important to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little bit I've done of this there
has shown me that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits to knowing what it is that the
people that are on the front line think.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is their perception?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular workshop, we wanted to
know what they thought were their barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: to sustainable agricultural activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the barriers preventing them from
planting trees and building a nursery and
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging in some of these activities on
their lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sent out an invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't appear too well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a really good response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked with about 20 soybean corn
farmers and cattle ranchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some images here from the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it works is that each member of
our group will give a five minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 10 minute presentation on something
that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get together with the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of like a brainstorming
session where they'll write down on small
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of paper what they think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come up to the front of the
room and put them on the board and tally
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we end up creating is like
sort of a mental map of what this group
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks are barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case here, the most important
of these factors here on the spider plot
[SPEAKER_00]: was a lack of land title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably isn't a big problem here,
but in the Brazilian Amazon, it's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers don't have title to their
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have title, you really
can't do a whole lot in terms of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: credit from a bank to incorporate some of
these sustainable activities on your
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know about a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without land title, it really makes
things very difficult for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other was the lack of technical
assistance in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the farmers basically said,
that there's a big lack of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified to guide them through these sort
of processes and techniques and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they end up doing is within their
community, they end up looking to one
[SPEAKER_00]: person who they perceive as being the best
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look up to this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of this group,
there is a farmer that they all mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know personally, this farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, well, that guy, he reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's able to incorporate new
techniques into his system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he does it, they'll look up to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll actually consult with him and
maybe follow his lead even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, as a research group,
that's really important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can maintain the
communication line open with that one
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer who's perceived to be the best,
then that's sort of a conduit to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the rest of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was an interesting result for me,
participating in these workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize here, then, final
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that there was about a
four-month window, dry season,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can incorporate a
drought-resistant cover crop to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: soil fertility, generate biomass for
no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl millet may be able to fit this niche
because it's able to generate sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: dry biomass, and also the question of 60
days of growth and 60 days of
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition to liberate nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's managed that way, it could fit the
niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry biomass values for no-till,
combining those from the Amazon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cerrado, we get a little more than six
megagrams per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The literature says six is sufficient to
establish no-till in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I question that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put right here why this value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The citation that I saw everywhere that
everybody uses is from 2001, but I never
[SPEAKER_00]: saw anything about why six megagrams was
established as the correct value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would need to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the idea would be to get out into
the Amazon in general to different farms
[SPEAKER_00]: and document the use of cover crops in the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would involve a lot of traveling,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also test several types of cover crops and
controlled field experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question of phosphorous cycling,
the ability to access moderate labile
[SPEAKER_00]: reserves in the soil and make them labile,
this transformation of phosphorous is very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be investigated for pearl
millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the model experimental farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be something that's going
to allow us to engage with farmers over
[SPEAKER_00]: time to show them what we're up to,
maybe show some new ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies, and find out what their
perceived difficulties are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to acknowledge CAPES.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a agency that's part of the Ministry
of Education in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They funded my proposal to come here and
stay for a year on a sort of sabbatical,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much, CAPES.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cornell librarians, when I started
this work, my first idea was to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: grand systematic review sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Mann Library and I sat a lot
with the Cornell librarians and talked
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great group of people, really
knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really sat with me, helped me out
quite a bit, showed me all the great
[SPEAKER_00]: resource that the library has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Cornell librarians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Ryan and the SCL, I have to say thank
you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's welcomed me with open arms since I've
been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot with them, even though
we're from different areas, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all here to learn, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank them, Matt especially,
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, finally,
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't forget the family, all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family has been very patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come to a new place, a new
culture, learned a new language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they accepted the challenge,
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have been behind me the whole time
that I've been here, working, been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: library, preparing this talk, the paper
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all can't forget our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, jeez, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is it costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it can be complicated like a
lot of things in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as long as there's no big conflict
between two people who say they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: owner of the land, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a certain amount of
resources and money to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's not even the biggest issue
with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know what the benefits will
be if they get land title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they get it, they'll have to be
registered into the registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a national registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll have an obligation to do
a whole bunch of things with their land,
[SPEAKER_00]: geo-referencing and report to the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be monitored and this sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the landowners just say,
what the heck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that they can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, as long as there's no
conflict between different landowners,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're open to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that sometimes they perceive
that there really aren't that many
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, even though they would be able
to get credit from the bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your crops in the dry season, you've got
your 60 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're anticipating 60 days of growth and
60 days of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also showed that over the last
period, you've had perhaps four major
[SPEAKER_04]: droughts that pushed your crops in,
perhaps even another 60 days down the
road.
[SPEAKER_04]: So were you thinking about what is
happening with that crop decomposition at
[SPEAKER_04]: that time, whether or not you're sort of
decreasing in the amount of nutrients or
[SPEAKER_04]: recycling you'd be able to do,
or whether or not those decomposition
[SPEAKER_04]: products would end up on the soil complex
again, and not necessarily available?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I did show the- If you haven't
extended drought under this scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that's an interesting point to
be able to incorporate into the first
[SPEAKER_00]: draft of the paper, which I didn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did show the figure, I think,
of 240 days of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could actually go back, see those
studies that went that far to see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil enrichment factor would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to remember that,
because that's actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the sort of decomposition nutrient
recycling component, it sounded like you
[SPEAKER_01]: were sort of targeting having nutrient
availability when the next crop was
[SPEAKER_01]: planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two questions about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, would you want that actually to be
more at the time when the major nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake is by that crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be hard to coordinate,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just give you a little longer
time to grow the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just say, oh, maybe we want to
grow it a little longer, looking at that
[SPEAKER_01]: period of availability of the nutrients,
having more of an overlap with the uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: of the subsequent crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other half of my question is,
with the moisture cycle, have you thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about that affecting all the processes,
the growth and the decomposition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were these crops planted during that part
of the year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean planted during the dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would that affect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess the basic question is,
with the studies you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: were the cover crops all planted during
that dry period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's something also that I could
look at to sort of shore up, make stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: my case in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see when these were planted,
see in fact if they're actual during the
[SPEAKER_00]: real dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write these down mentally,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so again, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of alluded to the fact that you
might want to combine the pearl millet
[SPEAKER_03]: with the legume, sun ham.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why did you not, I mean in the end you
didn't kind of come back to that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but would that make sense even if you
follow it with soybean and maybe that
[SPEAKER_03]: might boost the soybean yields a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well that, I mean I probably should
have, not just here, but also in the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper was already probably too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also, time constraints and
everything, but there's no question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently the pearl millet doesn't
release enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases it gets sequestered in the
biomass during heat composition or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combining it with the sun ham would be
an excellent idea because the papers I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen says it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean first of all, that's the first
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is that sun ham is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know personally a couple of different
farmers that use it, but they only use it
[SPEAKER_00]: once in a while and it's just for breaking
nematode cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would definitely, I think you'd
have to because adding, what is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could avoid that maybe putting in the
sun ham.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to expand on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can maybe cut something out of the
paper and include a section on
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping, I think it would make my
case a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

University.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
