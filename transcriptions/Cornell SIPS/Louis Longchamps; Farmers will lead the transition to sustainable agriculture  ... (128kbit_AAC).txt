[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonjour tout le monde.
[SPEAKER_03]: C'est mon plaisir de vous accueillir
aujourd'hui pour le premier séminaire
[SPEAKER_03]: officiel de la session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis Longchamp, assistant professor of
digital agronomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to tell you a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week, it was like a very quick
lightning talk about a few things that we
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing in the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, I would like to go a little bit
more in depth in what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: achieve, bringing the people together,
trying to change things maybe in different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways, how we want to accelerate change in
agriculture so that we can reach
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable ag and agroecology faster than
the pace that we are on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry that I want to share
something early on with you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to click on the thing first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to share this with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I watched a TED Talk from
Rockstrom, Joanne Rockstrom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out like three weeks back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the TED Talk, he's presenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of an update on the planetary
boundaries that came out like in 2009,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a new report in 2023,
and he's talking about the tipping point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here what you see is that, see a human
pushing the earth and potentially crossing
[SPEAKER_03]: that tipping point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the new normal is a hothouse
herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of a scary thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he goes in detail and then he
shows those tipping points across the
[SPEAKER_03]: planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can see that on, we can see that
for a bunch of those like six,
[SPEAKER_03]: the five first ones, we're already in the
line where we can see those tipping point
[SPEAKER_03]: changing how our planet looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this tells us that, I said that we need
to have something happening, not in 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years, not in 20 years, but right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to see change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sustainable development goals
from the UN started in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in 2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is to achieve all that by 2030.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luck is taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we make a lot of innovations and
progress in ag research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have different fields and we are kind
of attacking the problems from all sides
[SPEAKER_03]: and we are finding solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all hope that it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we invent a solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run with that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass it to the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers take that thing and then just run
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then change is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is that it's a little bit
more complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have invented something,
once you have put something together that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've demonstrated with scientifically
that it can have a change, it can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: change, it's not necessarily happening at
the pace that we would like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an illustration here of a
recent paper based on a remote center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since they looked at the cover crop in
the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much do you think, what was the
percentage in 2011 of the land in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Midwest that had cover crops?
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler, 5.4.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really want that thing to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you look at the title of the paper,
rapid increase in cover crop adoption
[SPEAKER_03]: across the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: What rapid increase looks like is like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is real data.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have plenty of scientific
evidence that cover crops are good and
[SPEAKER_03]: they are compatible with farming,
yet adoption is tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other examples, this is in the Deux-Sèvres
region in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to read that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a project involving 400 farms and
around 40 villages in the Deux-Sèvres
[SPEAKER_03]: region in Western France, where scientists
are experimenting with different
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques to cut pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the farmers who participated in the
experiment and saw the results with their
[SPEAKER_03]: own eyes did not noticeably change their
practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that tell us is that you had
scientists there demonstrating and
[SPEAKER_03]: experimenting on farmers' field.
[SPEAKER_03]: But farmers were not the leaders of that
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were observing it going and it did
not stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not adopt it as their own
practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not integrate it in their
practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another long quote from Dan Tauri,
conservation practitioner in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: If no-till corn is done incorrectly,
for example, if a farmer uses the wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: planter setup or does not use starter
fertilizer on the planter, corn yields and
[SPEAKER_03]: profits may be reduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this happens when a producer first
switches to no-till, they may be more
[SPEAKER_03]: likely to go back to previous methods,
this case tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is always a learning curve with
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes some producers risk-averse
because if they do something different,
[SPEAKER_03]: they may miss important details and run
the risk of reduced yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a simple thing that we can
all picture in our head, but this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: very important process going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: When farmers try something to gather
evidence that it works for them,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it doesn't work, then now they have
evidence that it doesn't work for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to get at is that change is a
people's process.
[SPEAKER_03]: A very interesting paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are about to release it, but I was
able to get access to it because I know
[SPEAKER_03]: the authors from Ruiz and Dumont.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2024, what they did is that they
studied 50 farmers over six years that
[SPEAKER_03]: were adopting cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: The process of adopting the practice of
cover crops on their farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are social scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did is that they tried to see
where they are in that chain of process
[SPEAKER_03]: from inaction, where you don't even have
an opinion, you don't really care,
[SPEAKER_03]: to integration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Integration here, it's a little bit
different from adoption in their
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do something on your farm,
it's considered adopted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: They adopted it, but in their definition,
it's more like a tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your tractor breaks, you're not like,
I'm not going to use tractors anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to fix the damn thing and
make it work because it's integrated in
[SPEAKER_03]: your operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of your farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: From inaction to integration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there are three steps here,
from resistance to inflection.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my life, this is where my scientific
work, this is where I have operated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm studying things in the field research
farm, even on farms, gathering evidence,
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzing the data, preparing scientific
publication, extension publications,
[SPEAKER_03]: presentations like that, seminars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I show the evidence that things are
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things will benefit the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things will make a better life,
better everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the idea here is to tip the
perception from, yeah, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: To, oh yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seems good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like to change, to go from
negative to positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've stopped there normally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I have published stuff, then I move
on to the next thing and then continue
[SPEAKER_03]: working on things that are not finished
and then working on other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm just trying to push that
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should try it on your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is similar to a lot of scientists
where we stop here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then at that point, farmers needs to take
that baton that we are giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they need to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they perceive a positive benefit,
at this point, what they will do is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they will experiment with that new
approach, new technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my case, it was precision input
management, but it could really be
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to obtain evidence that it works
for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran a series of interviews in New York
to ask farmers how are they experimenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say we met with 15 farmers,
two hours each and then we just discussed
[SPEAKER_03]: the experimentation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of them, they would do a
side-by-side experiment and then I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: asking them, I'm digital ag, so I'm like,
okay, what data do you get?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you analyze your data?
[SPEAKER_03]: More than one answered something like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it from the tractor cabin when I
harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it worked or it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the data that they use to move on
for next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will influence the decisions for next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: This experimentation process is not
trivial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it there here because I wanted to
show that we went from the TOC to the corn
[SPEAKER_03]: that we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no experimental design.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no science involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all on-farm experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing here for the three sisters,
way to grow crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or for the user fish head to bury under
each crop to get the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: No science, no experimental design,
no statistics or nothing involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: This evolved towards things that work,
things that are very significant like from
[SPEAKER_03]: TOC to corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to point this here that this
is an important process happening in
[SPEAKER_03]: parallel with science.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the scientific research that we
are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When farmers are experimenting on their
farm with that new practice that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: convinced that, whoa, it could do
something for me, help me more
[SPEAKER_03]: environmentally friendly or improve my
profits and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they experiment with it and if they
see something that doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_03]: then the danger is that they are back to
square one because the square one is
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it doesn't work, so now you
have all that work to go back to before
[SPEAKER_03]: they can try again.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this study, they looked at how long it
would take for farmers to go from one box
[SPEAKER_03]: to the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes about two years on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a real setback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking that we need to accelerate
progress, this is not trivial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I perceive this experimentation here as a
crucial process for change and progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what we realized is that everything
that we do, we develop in science will go
[SPEAKER_03]: through the filter of an farm
experimentation before it creates a real
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we know is that conventional research
benefits from all the bells and whistles
[SPEAKER_03]: of technology sensing, data organization,
data analysis and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: While on farm experimentation is a very
low tech process, which means that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: prone to error because if all you have is
to look by the tractor window,
[SPEAKER_03]: you may either make the wrong decision or
you may not understand why you made the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong or the good decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: The premise of my program is that digital
ag can support endogenous experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not just my program that does
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people that have developed
precision agriculture techniques realize
[SPEAKER_03]: that if I'm able to gather all those yield
maps, those as applied maps, and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: good stuff that is going on in precision
ag, maybe we can use it to experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a bunch of different groups
across.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see groups from Canada, NGO,
universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see a group in France here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really a very short partial list,
but it shows that people are trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: make this a new way of collaborating with
farmers through the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see a diversity in the approaches from
groups that are more researcher-centric.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would build a protocol and try to
disseminate it to as many farms as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two groups that are more farmer-centric,
sorry, here, okay, strict experimental
[SPEAKER_03]: design versus more open design.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you have a protocol that everybody
needs to adopt to be part of the network,
[SPEAKER_03]: while here everybody can do their own
protocol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have here more researcher-centric
where you want to have more, the goal is
[SPEAKER_03]: to do scientific publications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you have more farmer-centric.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal here is to have more pragmatic
information to see what works for them on
[SPEAKER_03]: their farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cooked up just through those
points there to illustrate a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: the distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting is that all those
groups have common challenges,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to gather and contextualize the
observations, how to analyze the data,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to help farmers learn from their
experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we are starting to engage with
farmers, those challenge emerge and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to develop the science,
the solutions to make this process more
[SPEAKER_03]: fluid and more easy so that we can scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this process, basically what we are
doing is that we're changing what we used
[SPEAKER_03]: to call an ad-edict.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see you have a farmer, you go visit
with a farmer, hey, I've seen this in that
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: For scientists, we see this as,
okay, this is an interesting observation
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually we use observations like that
to create hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us, this is an anecdote.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't necessarily consider this as
potentially a scientific observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with data science, what we can do is
that we can transform this into something
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody have heard of the G by E by M.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea here is to say, okay,
you saw that observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the G by E by M context of this
observation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this makes that one observation worthy
of a scientific database that we can use
[SPEAKER_03]: to start learning, to see trends and
patterns that can emerge that we may not
[SPEAKER_03]: have seen with traditional small plot
experiment or by just talking with farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: at the coffee shop and learning from their
anecdotes here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Globally, if farmers innovations were
valued at just 0.5% of farming production,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is $4 trillion, that would match
formal R&D investment from the private
[SPEAKER_03]: sector, which is about $20 billion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it there just to show the scale of
if we're able to transform those
[SPEAKER_03]: observations into something, into
scientific data, all of a sudden we have
[SPEAKER_03]: access to a wealth of new data to learn
about agronomy and about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just about data.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to describe a little bit what is
the on-farm experimentation cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here first, we need to engage with
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers need to understand what we're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to understand why also they want
to experiment and to be on the same page
[SPEAKER_03]: with them so that when we engage,
we help them reach their goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then comes the part where we acquire the
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We clean and assemble the data,
organize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do some first analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we continue the analysis with some
things that are more in-depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we discuss with the farmers and
partners to learn together from the
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have a process to review and
repeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea here is that if we are able to
close that loop of experimentation within
[SPEAKER_03]: one year, we are more in line with what
farmers typically do that they iterate
[SPEAKER_03]: until they have a working solution as
opposed to how scientists experiment where
[SPEAKER_03]: we want to replicate two, three years,
the same experimental design, the same
[SPEAKER_03]: protocol so that we can publish from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at this thing here,
you have really different groups going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you will have more agronomists and
social scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you will have agronomists,
but also data scientists involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, here to interpret the results and
to understand the farmers and to help
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers learn from that result,
again, we have agronomy and social
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: This really makes it a co-creation process
where we recognize local actors' capacity
[SPEAKER_03]: to explore and we build on the scientists'
capacity to quantify and detect patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least in digital agronomy, this is what
we are good at, to quantify things and
[SPEAKER_03]: detect trends and patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really a good example of
decentralized research and the idea is to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to be iterative and flexible.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I wanted to show you here is this is
a retransdisciplinary approach because you
[SPEAKER_03]: have all three agronomy, data science and
social science working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agronomy is there for consistent
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use the science, soil and crop science,
chemistry, physics, biology to have
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent interpretation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use that science to interpret what we
are seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we use data science to get greater
certainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever we conclude, whatever we analyze
is based on actual data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have social science to make this a
more effective process to help people work
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the middle of this, this is the on-farm
experimentation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my intro on farm experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: For you to understand a little bit what is
the principle.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to do next is to show you a
quick example of how it could look like in
[SPEAKER_03]: practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never done a program like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was at Agriculture and Food Canada,
I started to work on a living lab with
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The objective was to reduce the pollution
in the Saint Pierre Lake, which is a part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Saint Lawrence River.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the only thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we just start sitting together and
trying to understand who is doing what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scientists like explaining better what is
the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers trying to understand the problem
and maybe link to some practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I left and I came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been my first experience
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first experience here was with
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did is that I thought, I want to
try this idea, the idea of really helping
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers experiment, but on their turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: To support farmer-led experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did is that I consulted with
extension specialists and industry service
[SPEAKER_03]: providers to learn what are farmers
interested in this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they experimenting with?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this came back on biologicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea was that, biological is like it's
a cocktail of bacteria that you apply with
[SPEAKER_03]: the corn at seeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is able to fix nitrogen and
supply part of the nitrogen to the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the beginning of the project,
everybody wanted to experiment with it
[SPEAKER_03]: first because it was a big promotion
campaign from the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the numbers were aligning.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying that would provide 40
units of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would look like a $5 saving per acre
for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, okay, let me try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they went on the tipping point.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were convinced to try it on their
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we consulted with specialists.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a soil microbiology project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a soil microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: The process of farm experimentation relies
on working with experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we consulted with Dan and Alicia to
understand how is this thing working?
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the bacteria, what happens is
that you have the bacteria, clebsiella
[SPEAKER_03]: varicola, in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it fixes nitrogen by being in
symbiosis with the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when it has enough nitrogen for its
organism, boom, it stops fixing the
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the company did is that that's a
bacteria that is very good to colonize the
[SPEAKER_03]: corn roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's modify it to make it better at
fixing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they found a part where it says,
okay, I had enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just removed that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I learned from working with
soil microbiologists.
[SPEAKER_03]: With this, the process would restart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indefinitely, and then just continue
fixing nitrogen nonstop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the nitrogen that becomes available
for the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I talked with the cooperative
extension people and service providers to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn what people are experimenting,
then I consulted with specialists to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more about the topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that, we met with farmers to
understand and with specialists in
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen and corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And soil to just generate some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the questions that will be
relevant to understand with this process?
[SPEAKER_03]: The questions that came out are,
okay, what is the effect on crop nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: status?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not just looking at yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we will look at yield,
but not just the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to see, does that increase the
nitrogen status of the crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the organism be present in the soil
during the season?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not there, that means it's not
doing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And farmers wanted to know, is there a
link with some management that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_03]: with the type of soil, with the weather,
if it's a drought, dry year or a wet year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so with all that and learning from
the soil microbiologists on how to
[SPEAKER_03]: collect, transport and store and process
the samples, then we just went and
[SPEAKER_03]: collected a bunch of samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we identified, we met the farmers via
the CCE and the Cornell Cooperative
[SPEAKER_03]: Extension and the service providers to
have some address, some names,
[SPEAKER_03]: some phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we contacted them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those farmers explained to us,
okay, what is my experimental design?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is the field?
[SPEAKER_03]: They met with us in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a flag there from here to there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a little bit of a cumbersome
process, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we were able to see where their
experimentations were taking place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at this, here,
it's a little bit all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see normal strip trial,
alternative strips, side by side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is very common, how farmers
experiment just side by side like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adjusting fields, so they kind of assume
that those fields are very comparable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would test this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We even said that one, edge rows,
we know very well about the edge effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: but still some farmers, I mean,
he said like, yeah, I don't care much
[SPEAKER_03]: about the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna put the control there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't say like, okay, then we don't
engage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We said, okay, let's collect all the data
still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it's time to analyze it,
it will become a confounding factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the farmer will learn from this
experience, rather than if I would just
[SPEAKER_03]: tell them like, no, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so then we went there and with
interns, students, we collected a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: samples at every location, trying to make
it like very efficient trips every time we
[SPEAKER_03]: went out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Phil worked on a process to simplify
gathering, retrieving all sorts of public
[SPEAKER_03]: domain information, such as like the
weather data, remote sensing imagery,
[SPEAKER_03]: drought index, topography, and then soil
series.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just by delineating the boundaries of
the field, then all the data is
[SPEAKER_03]: aggregated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have this to contextualize those
observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this part was tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went and consulted with the farmers to
know like, what did you do in this field?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the step from planting to harvest and
cover crops, and we had all sorts of
[SPEAKER_03]: things there, and we had to do a lot of
back and forth to get that information as
[SPEAKER_03]: accurate as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was all on paper and it was a
little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we processed those samples,
the soil roots samples, to detect the
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of the bacteria using QPCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now we have like a mountain of
data, okay, from all the context data,
[SPEAKER_03]: all those agronomic sample data,
all the data that came from filling out
[SPEAKER_03]: those fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is digital agronomy right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a pile of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to say, okay, how do we present
this to the farmers so that they learn
[SPEAKER_03]: something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at that point, it felt more like,
man, we're going to confuse them more than
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we thought is like, okay,
let's transform every data into something
[SPEAKER_03]: that looks more like an infographic and
that is more like a graphic that can be
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzed briefly and simply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each data, we generated infographics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go too much in depth
on this, but for each piece of data,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, I mean, it's not so easy,
but you have the treatment versus the
[SPEAKER_03]: control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we would be able to do like
distribution curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: The yield coming from the treatment,
the yield coming from the control,
[SPEAKER_03]: are they perfectly overlapping?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a shift?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a difference?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then here, that data here is a little bit
trickier to understand, but this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen versus the yield potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it shows is that here you are in
the response part of the curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more nitrogen equals more yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here you are in the flat part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more nitrogen doesn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we wanted to farmers to see like,
hey, if you're here and you put 40 units
[SPEAKER_03]: less, more or less, it's not going to
change your yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was an important piece of
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that, trying to see like,
okay, how can we illustrate the QPCR
[SPEAKER_03]: results?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we draw like really how did we wear and
how we collected the sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did an infographic with this
so that they can quickly see, is there a
[SPEAKER_03]: bar or there's nothing there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any data from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that, remote sensing helps us
like see like, is there a spatial
[SPEAKER_03]: variability in the field?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the weather data showing like,
it's maybe a little bit easier to see
[SPEAKER_03]: here, but then versus the rest of the
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can start seeing,
okay, was there drought during that year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a dry year or it was a normal year?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can start seeing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then another piece of information that we
wanted to add was benchmarking.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did your field, so you will find
something in terms of your yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of the bacteria and your nitrogen
status.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how is this, when you get this
information, how did your management
[SPEAKER_03]: compare to the other people in the
network?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we had 23 farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to draw bucks plus like
that, that kind of illustrate the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this, we can put, okay,
this is your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see, okay, here I had quite low
growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wheat pressure was a little bit high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one of the highest yield in the
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, so now you quickly see by
benchmarking with others, like how things
[SPEAKER_03]: are panning for you, where you stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now that we had like,
okay, those infographic, we did not just
[SPEAKER_03]: throw those at them, by themselves,
we provided a key to help them interpret
[SPEAKER_03]: the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that they would go through that
key, flip through the pages and then see,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, this is how I interpret this result.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this, they would be able to get
to a conclusion for each of their site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, remember that it's a side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have replications.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you have really one thing to look
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from this, you want to conclude
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's not going to be a
scientific conclusion, but what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do is to stack layers of
evidence that kind of all point in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have 10 things pointing in the same
directions, conclusions are stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: If everything is all over the place,
conclusions are weaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the data allows you to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, so we went through the yield
first, that was the most important
[SPEAKER_03]: question for them, then nutrition index,
and then was the bacteria in the field or
[SPEAKER_03]: not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And for each of those, they would mark if
it was very clear or it was fuzzy in their
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation, just to allow them to,
yeah, this is something, decide something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you have to be perfectly clear,
it's better to have a conclusion with a
[SPEAKER_03]: level of certainty than nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then with this, we would
generate a conclusion and a level of
[SPEAKER_03]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we looked a little bit, the results
were a little bit all over the place,
[SPEAKER_03]: but here, what I wanted to show is that in
general, there's a good agreement between
[SPEAKER_03]: very simple, just looking at yield and
adding more data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it does here is that when you see
something like, hey, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have more data, what it allows you
to do is that you can learn why,
[SPEAKER_03]: or allows you to ask question,
why it maybe didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you just have, it didn't work
for me, then you may just ditch it and
[SPEAKER_03]: never return again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're trying something new,
if you understand why it didn't work,
[SPEAKER_03]: now you're kind of willing to give it
another go, maybe the following year,
[SPEAKER_03]: or to kind of pursue the learning process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then that allows us to kind of
see at the network level to understand a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit more what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna go briefly over this here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Phil used AI to try to understand a
little bit what's going on in the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we looked at the presence of the
bacteria KV, and then we just threw like
[SPEAKER_03]: all the variables, try to see what could
explain the presence and absence,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the level basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we saw like, okay, it's inversely
related with the other bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are two bacteria in that
cocktail.
[SPEAKER_03]: If one bacteria picks up, then the other
one is kind of recessed and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of interesting,
and that would explain why they put two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there was a bunch of things that
some make sense, organic matter,
[SPEAKER_03]: some are maybe a little bit harder to
interpret.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then what this does is that it could
be, so some of those, it's easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: dismiss, yeah, it doesn't, like giving an
agronomic diagnosis of that kind of data,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see, yeah, no, that doesn't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And working with farmers also,
they can quickly see things that make or
[SPEAKER_03]: don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it does is that things that we
don't have a clear answer, why is this so
[SPEAKER_03]: impactful, then it could generate new
hypothesis for research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something about the slope,
something about the calcium that could
[SPEAKER_03]: change something in the the abundance of
the bacteria in the soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, if we had a conversation with
specialists, we could dismiss some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those, but some of those things coming up,
we could investigate further.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to touch on this because this
process here is kind of powerful for
[SPEAKER_03]: problem finding, for generating new
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of generating your research
hypothesis based on a farmer that points
[SPEAKER_03]: at something that they found in their
field, that's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have a new process that says
like, hey, this is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see that consistently over the years,
over the fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't understand why there's such a
strong relation here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now that's a new kind of interesting
research project to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we wanted to learn from that first
iteration of on-farm experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we learned that farmers
appreciate this way of collaborating and
[SPEAKER_03]: were engaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they were doing it either if we
were there or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: The engagement was really to exchange the
data and then work together to interpret
[SPEAKER_03]: the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Data exchange was a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flow, this is a very slow flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the conclusions with data are what we
see that they are more nuanced and they
[SPEAKER_03]: raise questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, it would be very clear for
farmers what they learned from their
[SPEAKER_03]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is that when you do it
side by side, you cannot have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: level of certainty that when you do a
scientific experimentation, but yet you
[SPEAKER_03]: can learn something.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so this kind of fueled the second wave
of development.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we are going to do another cycle of
on-farm experimentation, let's be more
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared to make it a little bit more easy
because by the time we started,
[SPEAKER_03]: the first project and the time that we had
all the results ready, it took two years
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was such a mess to go through
and it was like a learning process.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea here is that we need to be able
to kind of make it happen quick so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can do a full cycle in one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's try to develop tools that will
help us do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those tools to quickly learn and to
maybe allow for a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity on what and how farmers want to
learn is the experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experimentation card, the experiment
card, we're basically asking, OK,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is your hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you going to test your hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to measure?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you going to interpret those
measurements?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be very simple, but at least it
kind of puts on paper a little bit of more
[SPEAKER_03]: motivated or more practical way to
experiment for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps them crystallize this on paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we are working on the development of
an OFE dashboard, and this will allow us
[SPEAKER_03]: to better capture the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to build a web tool that will
allow farmers to say, OK, I'm dedicated to
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment in that one plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would not do this for their entire
farm, but I'm experimenting in that one
[SPEAKER_03]: plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have scientists from Cornell,
from different groups coming and helping
[SPEAKER_03]: me to extract the information and learn
more from that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our hope is that they will be willing
to spend a little bit of time at night to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of populate and explain what they did
in the form of a timeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would just add every operation
that they did during the season for that
[SPEAKER_03]: one field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with this, we will have access
directly to all the detailed information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we are starting a survey on farm
experimentation and digitalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to learn a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one survey that exists and it said
that 90 percent of farmers were
[SPEAKER_03]: experimenting, but now we want to see,
OK, is this does that hold for New York?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then learn a little bit more about
that process, like what kind of data they
[SPEAKER_03]: collect and how they interpret it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, Katie, Alison and Mircey will be
collaborating in this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a new website coming up,
Farmers Data Lab, where we want to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: centralize both the information about what
is this process, but also a way to get
[SPEAKER_03]: engaged for farmers to work with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to touch here that the next
round of farm experimentation next summer
[SPEAKER_03]: will be on adjusting nitrogen rates in
corn after cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this project was funded by the New York
Corn and Soybean Grower Associations in
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboration with the American Farmland
Trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice because when we presented the
project, I presented it this way,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we want to help farmers de-risk their
experimentation and learn more from it and
[SPEAKER_03]: grow as association.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they like the idea and they funded
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of a good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a positive thing for the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so now I just want to to finish or to
conclude on how I see that this could
[SPEAKER_03]: become like a little bit of a vision for
the future if we are able to scale this
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we have farmers here that are after
pragmatic knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to find things that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't necessarily understand why this
same thing as when they developed the
[SPEAKER_03]: three sisters, they may not have
understood exactly how the beans were
[SPEAKER_03]: fixing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is what farmers are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have academic research where we
are looking for semantic knowledge,
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is general knowledge that
can be universal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this part here, we have observational
research, so it's all anecdotes that are
[SPEAKER_03]: transformed into scientific piece of
observation that can be used in a database
[SPEAKER_03]: for analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this way we can find trends and
patterns in the data generated here.
[SPEAKER_03]: While here we are developing the
experimental design so that we can run
[SPEAKER_03]: statistics and quantify and quantify the
processes and explain like causality and
[SPEAKER_03]: better understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea here would be that those two
would work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both are very important for the
acceleration and the transition to a
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how it could work is that with this
here, we could generate hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_03]: as I was saying, OK, maybe something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we see something that is very
strong, but we don't understand why.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that becomes an hypothesis for
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say here also is that if we just
spin that wheel without the connection
[SPEAKER_03]: here, maybe we will find something that
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we don't understand it,
maybe we over time, like in 20 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years, boom, the thing will break.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we don't understand why,
because we did not have a clear
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of the processes behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the connection is super
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then here, academic research provides
an understanding so that we can roll with
[SPEAKER_03]: that pragmatic knowledge and really
continue to progress and accelerate the
[SPEAKER_03]: progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this way, back to my title,
that's why I think farmers will lead the
[SPEAKER_03]: transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in this process, farmers are
leading the experimentation, the
[SPEAKER_03]: exploration process.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so people that are making this
possible, I mean, I did not realize before
[SPEAKER_03]: putting that slide together that so many
people were involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So grad students, Alex, Phil, Katie,
and then all the interns that were with us
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, during the season, I mean,
when we are going to all those fields,
[SPEAKER_03]: having a big team allows us to just hop
from one field to the other and be very
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then collaborators to the program and
funding here with Cornell AES,
[SPEAKER_03]: USDA, Atkinson, Cedar, New York Growers,
and Soybean Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so if you want to learn more,
and I'm going to stop on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is an important paper that was kind
of explaining all the principles of unfar
[SPEAKER_03]: experimentation and how it can transform
global agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are putting out every month a
newsletter on the topic of unfarm
[SPEAKER_03]: experimentation via the International
Society of Presidents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are also putting together a new
network called the GoFund, the Global
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfarm Experimentation Network,
so that we can all share tools,
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge, develop the science,
and organize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit like a society.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mircey and I are kind of leading this
initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have five minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: David?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said David first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering a bit about the balance in
the drivers behind unfarm experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an example, PivotBio is advertising
on country radio stations every five
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
But maybe Harold can't afford an
advertisement every five minutes for a
slow development, or internationally,
like JICA was always pushing effective
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganism as part of their development
mandate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe conventional extensionists
didn't have that option, that budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the driver for unfarm
experimentation is driven by a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: entity to the disfavor of research
generated, how do you address that?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we went with the PivotBio
experiment, I must say foolishly now,
[SPEAKER_03]: after the fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kind of thinking was that, OK,
I like the idea that nitrogen comes from a
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria rather than coming from natural
gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this could be a sustainable thing,
because I mean, we can pick and choose the
[SPEAKER_03]: experiments that we want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of OK with the principles
behind the farmer data lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so then I felt like, OK, this could be
fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, you apply it, treatment
versus control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will make for kind of a simple
learning experience, as compared to maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: working more with cover crops or no-till,
where you can have some a lot of diversity
[SPEAKER_03]: between the control and the treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to go with something simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are right that we cannot just
respond to everything that is going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing, the solution or maybe the
way to work with this is to rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: taking everything that is coming our way,
however it is, is to kind of be more
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose oriented for what we choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that I'm thinking to do is
when we do those experiment cards,
[SPEAKER_03]: we may have topics, start with topics,
and topics that are related to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: the science that we know work and that we
want to kind of push.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harold and then David.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two quick questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that experiment that involved the
end probes was thrown out because I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get your point that that's how the
farmer wants to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to throw out the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because Ted goes all the ways on
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other question that I have is when
you say given bio work, like in 24% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cases, what does that mean that it worked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it economically work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're talking quite a bit for a
product that's actually given an economic
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you detonate sort of an aggregate
analysis if it only works in one out of
[SPEAKER_02]: four cases and you pay, what was it,
$20 or something like that per acre?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how does it pencil out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how we determine that it worked is
that with increased yield, you were in the
[SPEAKER_03]: response curve of nitrogen and the
organism was present.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we could deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're right that we don't know if it
was economically viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have yet to kind of dig into
the data to extract all the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right that some fields we could
not work with some experimental sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I showed at the end was just 16
fields out of the 23 because some that are
[SPEAKER_03]: just not good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually 16 is not much to try to look
for trends and patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better than zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, better than zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like the idea is to find
tools so that we can kind of scale because
[SPEAKER_03]: the power really comes when you have
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is how you get the confidence
that you had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your interpretation tree and each
one you had a little confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think statistics are a really difficult
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you calculate that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we start from the premise that
farmers, they are used to look at their
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And decide something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case, you have the data in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did not do any stats because we
cannot really do stats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did is that you just look at
the data and you decide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the farmers themselves deciding
if they find that this is convincing or
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in the end, the conclusion will
serve them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because you see what the idea is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we were looking at yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not I want to work with you on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I think we can solve this when you
cannot conduct statistics is that with the
[SPEAKER_03]: data, you can have multiple signals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of touched a little bit on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will never be able to have like a
95% certainty about your conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you will be able is to have something
that will hint you for the subsequent
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to make a decision to move on to
learn something from your experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I think is that if you have maybe
two, three, four, five signals and the
[SPEAKER_03]: more individual dependent those signals
are, if they all point in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: direction, then that strengthens the
conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are in different direction,
then it weakens the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit of a paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have to work with the data that
exists.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
Thank you.
