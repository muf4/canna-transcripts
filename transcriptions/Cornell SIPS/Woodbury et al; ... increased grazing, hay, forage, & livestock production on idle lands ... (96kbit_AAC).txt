[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a little bit
different from the more usual 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: research seminar, as you can hear from our
affiliations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a combination of research,
especially the first section that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting, and then extending into a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to invite you all to join a
conversation that the three of us have
[SPEAKER_00]: been having for a couple of years about
exactly this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along those lines, I'd like to invite
you to jump in, get your hand up,
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupt with a question or a correction
or an observation, or if we're using some
[SPEAKER_00]: jargon that you're not sure about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please chime in at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for part one, I'm going to cover all
these topics, but fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to talk about what do we mean by
idle lands, and it's a little trickier
[SPEAKER_00]: than you might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another term is marginal lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same applies to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research portion that we did was
looking at what land might be available
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not currently in any type of
commercial production, and how much hay
[SPEAKER_00]: and forage could be produced on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the research part that I'm talking
about is assuming a high-intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: management on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the technical high-end potential
for production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say that's not typical for a
lot of land in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not managed at that high intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some very broad estimates of what
could we produce on these lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much beef could we produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much bioenergy feedstock and bioenergy
could we produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much hay and forage could we
produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mike and Aaron are going to jump
in with some reality checks on this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of technical potential and say,
what are some of the challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers that are in the way of achieving
this technical potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a nice photo courtesy of Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we talking about with idle
lands, marginal lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, if you're driving around New
York State, you often see the bottom land,
[SPEAKER_00]: which often it can be an annual crop
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see the hay bales here,
there's hay production on some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sloping land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the further up you get,
all this shrub land could be pasture,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be who knows what, could be
transitioning slowly back into forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we mean by idle lands for
especially my portion of the talk is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned, it's not currently in
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really a wide variety of land
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be more or less kind of look
like hay or pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might look more like shrub,
scrub land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not annual crop land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of territory in between
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to quantify this because
it's something that's not really counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agricultural survey gives us the land
that's in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an older separate survey of horses
in New York estimating they use about a
[SPEAKER_00]: million acres of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that's on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much of it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, we have very little
survey data about how these lands are
[SPEAKER_00]: being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an important thing here is when we say
idle, that really should have quotation
[SPEAKER_00]: marks around it because it could be used
for hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be used for some noncommercial
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't say that the land isn't being
used for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just know it's not in commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, marginal lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a chance to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sums it up very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gist of it is we use this loosely
for land that has biophysical problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice, this quote's from 1932.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of sloppy thinking and talk
about marginality is still happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the real definition is
economic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's marginal for some type of economic
production, meaning there's little or no
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility of a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on good soils, as you increase inputs
like fertilizer and labor, you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big jump in your return in
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: On marginal soils, you could put in the
same amount of effort and inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you get a much lower plateau of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if these are the production costs,
on the prime soils, you've got lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: room for profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the marginal soils, little or none.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, to me, what marginal really
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it marginal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we get back to the
biophysical part, often wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stony, perched water tables, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all may have your favorite issues
of what kind of limitations occur on some
[SPEAKER_00]: lands in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an important thing I said is some
marginal croplands are now wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be marginal for beef
production or for hay production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be great for wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marginality is an economic term,
and it's related to what the heck you're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did we go about, with all those
challenges, trying to estimate how much
[SPEAKER_00]: idle land there is?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with spatial data to look at
land cover through the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps us narrow down and get rid
of the forests and get rid of the annual
[SPEAKER_00]: cropland and the developed land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we use ag survey data to tell us,
at the county scale, how much land is in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our result, I'm not going to go into a
lot of detail about methods here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is just under a million hectares or
689,000 hectares of potentially idle,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially available land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a picture of land cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture for all of New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of forest, fair amount of wetlands
and developed land, about 9% in annual
[SPEAKER_00]: cropland, about 9% in grasslands that are
in production of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is what we came up with,
that about 5% of New York State is idle
[SPEAKER_00]: grasslands, about 3% is idle shrub and
scrub land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meaning what's there now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the, I mentioned the total,
but it's not all, all this land may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as I mentioned before, it's not
necessarily all really available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people want to do with their
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we then estimate production
potential on these marginal lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a combination of soil
properties and climate, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated into something called the
National Commodity Crop Productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: Index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a map showing this index
with the low values in red, the high
[SPEAKER_00]: values in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see much green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better ag lands in New York are
showing up in the mid-range of yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some patches of green there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we see a lot of these low
productivity or low soil quality lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Adirondacks, Catskills, and then some of
the southern tier as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is then this available,
potentially available idle land shown
[SPEAKER_00]: across this soil quality index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the index goes from zero to one,
so the high values are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for current hay land, we see most of
it's kind of in this mid-range,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning it's not all that different really
from a lot of our annual crop land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land that's currently in herbaceous
cover of some kind, again, most of it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of this middle range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shrub and scrub land,
[SPEAKER_00]: more of it is in this lower productivity
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important thing is it's really,
all of these are pretty well spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within any of these categories,
there are some soils that have some high
[SPEAKER_00]: biophysical soil quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's encouraging if we can find
those and use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to model potential hay and forage
production on these lands, we have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple generic model of productivity
potential for essentially perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created separate ones for warm season
grasses, meaning C4, and cool season
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses, meaning C3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this result is a technical
potential assuming a high intensity of
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's not typical,
but it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we evaluated these models by looking
at how do these models do with some data
[SPEAKER_00]: that we did not use to develop the models
from forage yield trials throughout New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is a photo of a yield trial
courtesy of Julie Hanson, who works very
[SPEAKER_00]: hard with a team on conducting these
trials for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three lines are models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about corn silage
today, but just to point out that the
[SPEAKER_00]: model and the data are higher for corn
silage than for any of these perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the cool season grasses,
there's a range among sites and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the data from these yield trials seem
to suggest that our simple models aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: too far wrong, meaning that the data are
falling reasonably close to our
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions that we're, again,
independent of these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick note on why are the warm
season grasses lower productivity than the
[SPEAKER_00]: cool season grasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just really a function of the
effort that's gone into breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: managing cool season grasses in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a great deal of effort and over
many years or decades, there's no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why the warm season grasses couldn't move
up further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we think is feasible
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of a warm season grass is
switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to read the whole
slide, but this was kind of our model
[SPEAKER_00]: grass for thinking about bioenergy
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the forage, we were looking more at
the cool season grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also translated essentially our
effort was on what's the forage production
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just used a simple,
very crude calculation to say a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: number of pounds of forage in a beef
stocker operation, meaning beef foraging
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many pounds of forage would translate
into a pound or a kilogram of beef?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a lot of work historically
on bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also looked at, again, the warming
season grasses, turning those into
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial quality pellets and using them
for heat and also for ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a summary for the entire
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very small bars are beef because
we're looking at total millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms per year on all of this idle
land base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beef production is very low in terms of
kilograms or in terms of millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the highest production potential
is the hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially with the pellets,
we're losing some through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also being made from the C4
grass, which according to our modeling is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be a little less productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at these in terms of the value
of that product, not profit, but just the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of that production at the wholesale
level, not too surprisingly, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: bars switch direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that small amount of beef production
has the highest dollar value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, all these other options had a
similar, roughly similar dollar value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a few challenges and barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the landowner's goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a location where it's feasible
to actually use this land?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need fencing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need drainage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need barns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is capital available, even if it's a
viable business model, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike and Aaron are going to talk about
a little more about some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you'll all think and chime in
if you think of other challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers, and of course, opportunities as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summarizing for point one, there's
quite a bit of land out there that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: in commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some fraction of that could be
available for increased production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some fraction of those lands actually
have decent biophysical soil properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a technical potential with high
intensity management to produce quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on these lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there are a lot of
challenges and barriers that mean it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be feasible to achieve all of
that technical potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few citations that will come up
at the end of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't really answered all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we could take a few
questions right now before we move into
[SPEAKER_00]: the second part, if anyone has anything
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Anne.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, I was curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of marginal lands may not be
continuous.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to have cows to produce,
there is a certain minimum amount of
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does your model account for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We removed pieces of land that were less
than five hectares, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were trying to kind of get rid of
those small pieces of land that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to bring into production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, did you look at all into why these
lands are not being used now?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we'll see the constraints later
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, did anyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or has anyone looked at, well,
why is it idle?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we're doing everything by
difference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're identifying the idle land because
it's not something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know almost nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it could be because there's not
enough labor or there's other aspects.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what are the reasons that no one
is using it now would be an interesting
[SPEAKER_07]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all we can say about that is the
slide I showed of sort of the histogram of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing that, in fact, quite a large
portion of these lands are of reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: production potential, according to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what struck me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I asked the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, so another clue you can look
at is landowner surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many landowners are not interested in
commercial production of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another quick answer,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as lands change hands, they tend to be
moving out of farmer hands and into other
[SPEAKER_00]: landowner hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another trend that there's some
data about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter, a good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you come across what is the intrinsic
value of these lands?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're marginal, but they could
have other conservation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those externalities, do they come into
play?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I realize for production,
but this might be an argument that
[SPEAKER_11]: somebody might say, what's wrong with
having them grow this crop for bird life,
[SPEAKER_11]: more of that kind of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, these lands have lots of value for
lots of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunting, there's some endangered,
there's some at least threatened bird
[SPEAKER_00]: species that nest in grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some operate like switchgrass
production is compatible with spring
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you just harvest in the fall
typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, there are competing current uses
that are non-commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other values to these lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why sort of the idle is in
quotation marks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to riff on something that David was
saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in a sense, you're sort of
selling yourself short on the idle land
[SPEAKER_06]: question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would perceive that the idle
land of today is going to become forested
[SPEAKER_06]: land of tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm wondering if maybe you should
sort of think that some of the forested
[SPEAKER_06]: land of today was in fact idle land of
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm wondering if the acreage that
you're looking at may be actually an
[SPEAKER_06]: underestimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been agricultural land that has
transitioned back to forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the location and what's going
on and seed sources for the forest and
[SPEAKER_00]: deer pressure, et cetera, it can take a
surprisingly long time, decades or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: or never to get back to sort of an intact,
valuable forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be kind of indefinite that it
can be in this shrub scrub hawthorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we've all walked through this
kind of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that answers at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I am just thinking from a land
potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you'd have to then,
in a sense, clear to put it back to idle
[SPEAKER_06]: land.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a potential wise, I would think
that there'd be a lot more land available
[SPEAKER_06]: that would fit into this model other than
the fact that definition is land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intentionally, we did not look at
forest land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did not look at wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those potentially could be brought
into production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our thinking is there's a lot more
conflicts with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a lot more effort and
challenge to actually achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we focus on the lands that
are not forests, not wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's move on to Mike and part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just add a few comments to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we think about what this idle land was
used for 50 years ago, it was in dairies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what has changed as these dairies have
moved, as the dairy structure has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though that land may be productive,
it's, as one person mentioned here,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in smaller acreages, harder to use
with larger equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these dairies have gone to land
more suitable to row crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big part, especially in
Southern Tier, why there's so much idle
[SPEAKER_01]: land in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I would argue is that
we want open land for aesthetic reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to look like New Hampshire,
at least I don't, where it's all trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think a very strong argument is
to keep open land.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at, I like this slide,
because when we look at whether a business
[SPEAKER_01]: can be profitable or not, it's based on
what their local resources are and making
[SPEAKER_01]: the best use of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this logger in Maine was smart enough
to know that he's well endowed with moose
[SPEAKER_01]: in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he used him to move his logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been able to confirm or deny
whether this is Photoshopped or real.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we all know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the pasture region, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forage region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow forages extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in the corn belt region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing corn really doesn't fit our
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so consequently, we need to,
again, if we're going to have profitable
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural businesses, we need to focus
on what we have lots of, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: forage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just some data from the Southern
Tier of vacant land that Dr. Iff put
[SPEAKER_01]: together for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Staben County.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a glitch in the data collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staben isn't that would fit in very well
with all the other counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you can see very visually,
there's a lot of vacant land in this
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Tier area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if she had done the Northern New York
area, and actually even some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: Central New York is the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the resources that we have in
New York to make beef cattle work?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a whole variety of markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of grass finished, organic,
GMO free, free range.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also do have some grain finished
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural is growing quite often,
which is often grain finished,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no use of growth promoting hormones or
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of the consumer demand,
those are resources that we can take
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Montana has an advantage where
they have lots of cows, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that gives us lots of opportunity
to diversify our portfolio, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: and meet that demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the advantages, and I'm going to
talk specifically about this stalker that
[SPEAKER_01]: was mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a youngish animal that's put on
grass grazes for the summer, and then goes
[SPEAKER_01]: into a finishing program, which can be
historically grain finished, but also can
[SPEAKER_01]: go into a grass finished system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that short period of time from May
to October time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of the few enterprises that
you can get into with very little capital
[SPEAKER_01]: up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to try to start a dairy,
it's nearly impossible unless you marry
[SPEAKER_01]: into it or inherit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that provides a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our cost of production is low here in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our calves are cheap, much to the
disgruntlement of our cow-calf producers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's reasons for that, which we'll
talk about another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got relatively good production per
acre in terms of forage, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely important for ruminants,
those that can take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have inexpensive land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people don't believe that,
but I came from West Virginia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and believe it or not, land in West
Virginia is more expensive than here in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go out into the corn states,
forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, for full-time farmers,
we have a relatively favorable tax
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, because if you get more than
50% of your gross income from agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: your taxes are greatly reduced in terms of
school and property taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the disgruntlement with taxes is really
not entirely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this stocker operation, we don't need
much equipment, which is why you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: into it without a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need much facilities,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing custom operations,
that is, owners of cattle will pay you to
[SPEAKER_01]: graze them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of capital up front
for the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's real good opportunities for
getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor flexibility is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beauty of all beef cattle
operations is if you're a dairy operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're tied to that dairy twice a day
plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a beef operation, you've got a lot
more opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to a meeting last night,
and he was going to be away for three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just filled the hay feeders over full,
and they'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had someone check on the cows,
obviously, but he didn't have to feed them
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with a grazing operation, you can do
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of giving them two acres like
you do every day, you know you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule that's going to conflict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you give them four or five acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Production goes down a little bit,
but it's not going to really impact
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability for that short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be started as a part-time
enterprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you're working off the farm,
a way to get into the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be incorporated with other
interests such as agroforestry,
[SPEAKER_01]: maple sort production in the winter,
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can and should probably utilize
purchase feeds for anything you do on most
[SPEAKER_01]: beef operations, and I can argue pretty
strongly on that one, even though you see
[SPEAKER_01]: way too much equipment on beef operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for our current skill force,
which is dairy, a lot of the skills that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have in producing high-quality forage
and having facilities and equipment can
[SPEAKER_01]: fit in very nicely with this, especially
in the wintertime when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow these calves until they're ready to
go to grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a lot of good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it with dairy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it with beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it with heifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it with cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are times of the year where
you can buy cows cheap enough that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: put weight on them inexpensively on grass
and then resell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a lot of flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's real advantageous
to us is the price cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at, so the top line,
which is the blue line, is over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years, this is the index of 550-pound
feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in the spring of the year,
they're very expensive, or that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest price.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lowest in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look what happens with the
750-pounder, which is basically the result
[SPEAKER_01]: of backgrounding or stockering that calf,
it's highest in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy the calves cheap and put
the weight on by using this cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a pretty strong cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not true every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is true every year, but it's a
pretty consistent historically system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the grazing potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I've not been able to
find any enterprise data past 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ignore 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a very odd year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those in the stocker business made a
lot of money, but it's not normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see over the last 10 years or
so, it's been about a $70 per head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at beef enterprises,
the stocker operation has more bars above
[SPEAKER_01]: the profit line than below as compared to
cow calf or finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stocker has a lot of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest challenge is that there's not
a good market infrastructure for moving
[SPEAKER_01]: those calves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that the larger the number to
sell, the better price we can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that producers need to work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of you that have worked with
farmers know getting them to work together
[SPEAKER_01]: is a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron and I spent 30 years trying to do
it, and we'll retire not getting it done,
[SPEAKER_01]: so for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cooperation is something that really
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a very antiquated,
if you will, auction market system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states have a very good marketing
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that market infrastructure probably
is our biggest drawback to getting this
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything else has fallen in place
pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I use any terminology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken's smiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for his... Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to do with slaughterhouses and they
perceived a limited number.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just finishing up another project
looking at the barriers to room and at
[SPEAKER_01]: production in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with that is a survey of packing
plants, mostly in New York and New
[SPEAKER_01]: England.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while there is areas of the state that
are... I'm talking about specifically New
[SPEAKER_01]: York, while there are areas of the state
that are short on packers, it has more to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with seasonality than it does with
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at a small processor,
they're really busy from about September
[SPEAKER_01]: to January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're really slow from then on
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so packers and producers need to work
together, that terrible word again,
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to even that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packers need to charge a little less in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Producers need to match their production
with availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some issues.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked mostly about beef stalkers.
[SPEAKER_10]: What about sheep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sheep could work too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sheep, certainly, there's some
predator challenges and some internal
[SPEAKER_01]: parasite challenges that you don't have
with beef cattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a comment.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the mid-70s, when I took a look at this
with some of my other colleagues,
[SPEAKER_10]: sheep looked very favorable when the
market was large in terms of essentially
[SPEAKER_10]: home consumption and filling the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beef was too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to have a large economic
impact with beef cattle or sheep for that
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, I think the system is going to be
both direct sales using smaller plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as some more commodity type
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because farmers do not like the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to say the only way you can do this
is to sell direct to the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to expand the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Ken is a great marketer and has built
up a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can point to a lot of farmers that
do that very, very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there something like crop insurance for
beef production?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I see a lot of variability year to
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had its average.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there were some years I would be
suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for the animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is crop insurance for pasture
and hay land.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the actual production of the feed
stock, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not on the animals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only subsidy, if you will,
again, is based on the feed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, as far as the grass finish
market, that we have some organizations
[SPEAKER_01]: now that are putting into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I said farmers don't like the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to produce, but they don't like
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we had a good steady
year-round market where I could say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I've got 20 grass finish steers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know they're going to be ready in
April.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about selling them
direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a little less money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll get a premium over the commodity
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are starting to get in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as they grow, we'll see more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're near the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no co-ops that are forming,
such as the grains in central New York?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a few around, but they've
struggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, is there kind of an opportunity for
somebody as a business proposition to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to, rather than getting everyone to
cooperate, to come in and maybe be grass
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing animals over the winter and sell
them out of time when the market's there?
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, to look at these gaps as a
business opportunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some coordination would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal opinion, but finishing cattle,
whether it be on grain or on grass,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a pretty skillful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the way this will work
eventually to be most efficient is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: will have professional grass finishers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will be much easier to fill
in these gaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the farm with 25 cows and finishing 10
calves a year, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He or she's never going to gain the skills
to be really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if somebody could have an
operation just to finish him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to be here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say one reason to keep land open
is because it's an awful lot of work to
[SPEAKER_04]: clear overgrown land because I've done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to talk about hay production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, in my experience, we're talking
about hilly rocky clay soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were dictator of the world,
I would force everyone to have a garden on
[SPEAKER_04]: hilly rocky clay soil so they could
appreciate good soil and have a little
[SPEAKER_04]: sympathy for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were to go to the farm newspaper
and buy some hay and look at the class
[SPEAKER_04]: fight ads, what kind of hay would you be
looking at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how would it be described?
[SPEAKER_04]: First cutting, second cutting,
alfalfa and grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to get my farmers to expand
their imagination of hay and think more
[SPEAKER_04]: about its end use so they can market it
for a target.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're when we're selling hay,
we have local markets and within the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have markets outside of the
country, which we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: About a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of late, addressing the the horses that
are metabolically challenged, they need a
[SPEAKER_04]: low sugar hay or grass finishing beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes too much protein is not the
way to finish beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need some high energy hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some dairy farmers actually buy straw and
stick it in their totally mixed rations to
[SPEAKER_04]: add a little fiber to the diet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of sheep, we have birds with tree
foil that can suppress parasites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have other animals in different
stages of growth and production that needs
[SPEAKER_04]: specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also we have our young livestock
that needs something that's palatable to
[SPEAKER_04]: eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a particular affinity for
Kentucky bluegrass ladino hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think farmers actually call
Kentucky bluegrass dog hair because it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: fine grass and they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes the bales don't hold
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nutritionally, it's actually a pretty,
pretty decent pretty decent forage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So has anyone ever heard of Western hay?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so when farmers think of Western hay,
even in the East here, they've got an
[SPEAKER_04]: image in their head of what Western hay
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice and green.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no weeds and it's usually pure
grass or pure alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess what I want to propose is why
don't we produce something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we brand New York hay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we think outside the box a
little bit and be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: creative?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my affinity for Kentucky bluegrass
ladino hay, I have a little one acre field
[SPEAKER_04]: outside my house that I've been playing
around with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at some of the nutrient
values of this, it's really quite good.
[SPEAKER_04]: In particular, we're looking at low
lignin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this column, if I went to Dairy One
and went to their library, this is mixed
[SPEAKER_04]: mostly grass hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the range of values.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we look at lignin, it's fairly low
in lignin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This hay here was sitting outside for five
days before I finally baled it because of
[SPEAKER_04]: weather and machinery.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the worst of the lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our water soluble carbohydrates are quite
high, at the high end of the range.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is simple sugars, again, at the high
end of the range of grass haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Total digestible nutrients, we're at the
high end again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our in vitro total digestibility looks
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we just need to get out of our
box a little bit and think about forage a
[SPEAKER_04]: little differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is we have a pretty
difficult environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of humidity out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes it's hard to make hay and dry
hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might need to add a little
technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is from a machine called a
macerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if I got a picture of it
in the next slide or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically a roller mill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your forage goes through two steel rollers
spinning at different speeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see how it scratched the wax
off this grass leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that helps the hay dry in good
condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you have some old reed canary
grass, the farmer that sells these is
[SPEAKER_04]: telling me he can take old reed canary
grass and run it through his macerator and
[SPEAKER_04]: it softens it up quite a bit to make it
more palatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the domestic market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can expand and be competitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers don't like the market,
but if we can get them to market and think
[SPEAKER_04]: about the end-use of their hay,
maybe they can have more loyal customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hay for export, alfalfa, timothy,
oat hay, ryegrass straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they produce a seed out in Oregon and
Washington, they take that straw and send
[SPEAKER_04]: it to Japan for their wagyu beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: We export grass hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We export straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of this is going out from the western
part of the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the National Hay Growers
Association meeting here in Canandaigua
[SPEAKER_04]: about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I attended and met a farmer from
Pennsylvania that actually exports hay out
[SPEAKER_04]: of Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hay exports, of course, of late markets
have changed quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hay exports have been increasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them go to Asia, but the Middle
East also buys a lot of our hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, Saudi Arabia is buying up
land in Arizona so they can produce
[SPEAKER_04]: alfalfa because they have a policy where
they don't want to be using their water in
[SPEAKER_04]: Saudi Arabia for growing alfalfa because
there's better and higher uses for it
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're coming to our country to
produce their hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just some of, this is,
you know, 2017 information here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are some of our hay exports.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just figure, why can't we get in,
here in New York, we have the Port of
[SPEAKER_04]: Albany, we have Oswego, and we have
Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we export some things out of our
ports?
[SPEAKER_04]: So China was going to build an alfalfa
protein extraction plant in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is some information I read in
2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went back and I don't think they ever
came through with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I read it back in 2014,
I was thinking, you know, alfalfa is 50%
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves and 50% stems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, why are we shipping ligaments
across the ocean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I love Ladino hay so much
is because the way it grows, you're really
[SPEAKER_04]: just harvesting the leaves and the stems
or Stallones that run along the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you get a rainy day, a couple rainy
days or rainy week, and you can't get to
[SPEAKER_04]: it when you want to, you're not getting
the increase in neutral detergent fiber
[SPEAKER_04]: that lignin like you do in alfalfa or
grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it holds its quality pretty well even
in bad weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can we produce, can New York produce
hay for export?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_04]: The West certainly has the edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can produce Timothy and mixed grass
hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can produce oat hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe there's some other options.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryegrass is also has excellent forage
quality to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something else we can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could think about and do we need to think
about some more technology, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some conditioning machinery, or maybe some
inoculants to help us beat the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, the transportation part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the climate for hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western companies might want to spread
their risk because out there they have
[SPEAKER_04]: water issues and I did talk to a couple of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't spread their risk by coming
out East, but they have considered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we do have a rail system here in
New York that goes throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different companies own the different rail
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I live here in Washington County and up
in Salem, there's a feed plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think they would get their corn by
rail from Albany, but actually they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to get it from East Springfield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a rail system, but it's a
little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the port of Albany, we take in calcium
chloride from Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, just in the back of my mind,
I'm thinking, why don't we do a back haul
[SPEAKER_04]: of hay, maybe some hay cubes and some
totes, something they can manage with
[SPEAKER_04]: their ships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus we have two other ports in New
York.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I don't think many New York
farmers take hay very seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the New York State Fair, there was only
18 contestants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably 2017 when I looked it
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a chapter of the American
Forage and Grassland Council here in New
[SPEAKER_04]: York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's just indicative of our
attitude towards forage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this here is probably our biggest
challenge is that many of our acres are
[SPEAKER_04]: managed by part-time farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're doing it on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it after work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for them to step up their game,
make their business a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: intensive, I don't think they've got the
energy or the interest to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just kind of want to cruise along.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have small field sizes, and that
does reduce a lot of our efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what, even out west and in the
east, profit margins are quite tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weather will always be a challenge to have
consistent quality, but that's something
[SPEAKER_04]: we can work with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we just need, for export,
we either need an entrepreneur that really
[SPEAKER_04]: knows how to make things happen or we need
to maybe subcontract with someone that's
[SPEAKER_04]: already in the export business to move
eastern hay across the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are just some of my thoughts on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think there's long-term,
I think exporting hay, the markets are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not a lot of data, but a lot of
thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I drive around my counties,
I see this idle land and the hardest part,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Mike said, was getting people to get
the entrepreneurial spirit and thought in
[SPEAKER_04]: their head to really make things happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for any of us?
[SPEAKER_09]: The third question, when you're thinking
about especially marginal land,
[SPEAKER_09]: and as you said, a lot of land in New York
is heavily rocked.
[SPEAKER_09]: When modeling the profitability of the
parent on investment, do you consider it a
[SPEAKER_09]: moral model when you're looking at putting
land into production?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because is there any risk of driving the
soil to a really low productivity starting
[SPEAKER_09]: off with land that is already in the
market?
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there a risk of degrading the soils
basically?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when we want to build our soils,
we usually put them into forage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think forage is a great way to build
soils and maintain and build soil quality
[SPEAKER_04]: and prevent erosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess if you have shrubs,
like in my little eight acre field,
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to pull up four inch pine trees and
honeysuckle bushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a little bit of disturbance
there, but it's a short term disturbance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that would be the only risk
there, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would just chime in and say,
again, kind of marginal depends what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most of these lands,
many of these lands are not at all
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for annual production on an
ongoing basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of them are biophysically
suitable for annual production.
[SPEAKER_07]: What strikes me the biggest problem,
you mentioned the variable weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're going to harvest the hay and
the quality, it's so variable in New York
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the West, they can guarantee a
quality for better.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you irrigate, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in the Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guarantee a quality to your body.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to be able to get a
higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, that's quite difficult for an export
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that West has an advantage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think if we really wanted to,
we could do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we added maybe a little bit more
machinery, maybe some inoculants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is why I was thinking more back
to what Peter said, back to something like
[SPEAKER_07]: the pellets or something that maybe is not
as economic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's much less dependent on having good
quality forage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more biomass and pellets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm in favor, but I'm just trying
to point out this seems like a really
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult thing for someone to invest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if the Westerners come here,
they want to diversify.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they say, yeah, but it's really
hard to make projections because the
[SPEAKER_07]: weather is so variable here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't be doing alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have Kentucky bluegrass and
Ladino clover and it rains all week,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to leave it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that changes is some leaves
die and some new leaves grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the quality doesn't, it's not like if
it was alfalfa for a whole week,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd be gaining like a percentage point
of NDF a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if we think outside the box a
little bit, we're not going to maybe be as
[SPEAKER_04]: competitive as the West.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we can play with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to formulate this into a
question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just looking at the three conversations
here, we have about somewhere north of $3
[SPEAKER_08]: billion worth of assets sitting out there
not being used.
[SPEAKER_08]: A million plus, a million and a half
acres.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have this industry which is
potentially profitable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just kind of not happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has to meet your critical mass or
industrial cluster or whatever it has to
[SPEAKER_08]: be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we have all this hay production
and we're thinking about exporting it when
[SPEAKER_08]: we have this enormous market that's eating
bees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably New York City is eating like a
million beet animals a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems like hard to quite put this
together and explain it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe it's just an economic
development question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe this land really isn't profitable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just like Bitcoin, which is
something you put money in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not virtual.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a store of values.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's not my sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: My sense is you can run profitable grazing
operations and get the land more
[SPEAKER_08]: productive by moving it in perennial
pasture.
But I guess the question then is why is
this the situation?
I mean, what is the solution?
Is this an economic development job for
our government?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or who does this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give you my non-cooperative
extension, Aaron Gabriel, point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we keep talking about feeding the
population in 2050.
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, we have way too much food
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real source of this issue is markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a profitable beef market,
consistently profitable beef market or a
[SPEAKER_04]: consistently profitable hay market,
there wouldn't be any idle land in New
[SPEAKER_04]: York or anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So honestly, we have an overproduction in
our system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's plenty of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know in some parts of the world,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not a matter of supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a matter of civil war and all the
other sociological things that are going
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I don't want to be depressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my neighbor has sold their dairy
animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just visited a farmer yesterday who's
going to be selling his animals in a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our whole production system is a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it costs a lot less to raise an animal
for one day in New York than it does in
[SPEAKER_08]: the places that we think of as beef
country.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot less.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the market is a lot closer.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the components of the system
are not here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The low cost processing, the finishing,
and the human capital around the beef
[SPEAKER_08]: world, even though we have a lot of dairy
people, it's really two different species,
[SPEAKER_08]: actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dairy versus beef.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I just bought grass-fed beef.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those places are getting drier.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're staying wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought grass-fed hamburger in the
store from Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there actually is a group,
a guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He spoke at our winter green-up meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm forgetting his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the name of his business.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's trying to get farmers,
he's trying to get two types of farmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: cow-calf operations and finishers to do
grass-fed beef here in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's getting farmers to work together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting that entrepreneur like this
person and yourself that's got the vision
[SPEAKER_04]: to actually make it work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a totally different financial
structure, though, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going from high value to milk is
pretty high value compared to beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 70 bucks a head profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to make a living,
you'd need 1,000 cattle.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my neighbor, I think he had a herd of
about 150 dairy cows.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got 300 acres to go to 1,000 head of
beef animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if every dairy farmer did that,
you know what happens to the markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to be depressing,
but it's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been with Extension for 23 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went into it to help farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 23 years later, it's the very same
issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what have I been doing all
this time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're about out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't we thank Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
