[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Tom Whitwell.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a faculty member in the horticulture
section of SIPs and today we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be doing some trash talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: As many of you may know the board
sustainability committee started about the
[SPEAKER_07]: first year beginning of classes this past
spring and it was catalyzed by our own
[SPEAKER_07]: faculty colleague Jane Mount Pleasant when
she realized how much junk there was and I
[SPEAKER_07]: say junk or trash but how much reusable or
recyclable or compostable things we
[SPEAKER_07]: produced at all of our meetings and it was
basically just going into our landfill.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jane convened a sustainability
committee and over the past nine months or
[SPEAKER_07]: so we've been trying to encourage everyone
to do things like bring their own utensils
[SPEAKER_07]: to events like this and bring your own
cups to put coffee in and so forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: The really big challenge that's facing the
committee and I would suggest maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: Cornell as well right now is upscaling our
composting operation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Composting happens but it's very difficult
to make it really efficient and we've got
[SPEAKER_07]: multiple sources, multiple kinds of stuff
and many of our local composting or
[SPEAKER_07]: smaller scale local composting operations
don't accept all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our composting or our sustainability
committee decided that we'd catch
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody close to the beginning of the
semester and talk about waste management.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how it works and how we can make it
work better.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be a tag team
presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our first presenter is going to be Jane
Mount Pleasant and I don't have any cool
[SPEAKER_07]: pictures in fourth grade or anything like
that or any of these people but rest
[SPEAKER_07]: assured I think that they will all have
their own entertaining and elucidating
[SPEAKER_07]: things to show us today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be treated to talks by
Jane, by three graduate students,
[SPEAKER_07]: Annika Huber, Isabelle Branstrom and Juana
Munoz and they're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about different aspects of waste
management.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jane, turn it forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much Tom for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice introduction but I do want to
say that it's mostly the graduate students
[SPEAKER_10]: that have been doing the lion's share of
this work and I'm really grateful to be
[SPEAKER_10]: working with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to talk about waste
management at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the first things is how much waste
do we generate and it is a pretty mind
[SPEAKER_10]: boggling term.
[SPEAKER_10]: Over 21,000 tons in 2014 and you can see
that compost is about 40% of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next big thing is our kind of commonly
understood research recycling we use and
[SPEAKER_10]: over 20% is up in landfill.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when we look at these big numbers,
how much is a ton, a lot of us have a hard
[SPEAKER_10]: time visualizing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well this is what a ton of landfill waste
looks like, at least the volume and the
[SPEAKER_10]: weight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you kind of get an idea of what 21,000
elephants, that's an awful lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're throwing into the land waste.
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's go back and look a little bit
more at our overall waste.
[SPEAKER_10]: A large portion of it is actually compost
and about almost 90% it is plant and
[SPEAKER_10]: animal waste.
[SPEAKER_10]: Animal waste being animal waste from our
farm operations and plant waste can come
[SPEAKER_10]: from all over campus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Food scraps make up only about 12% of
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of recycling and reusing we have
close to 3,000 tons.
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest chunk is what we commonly call
single stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the stuff that we put in.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the recycled paper and recycled
plastic and that's about 50%.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yard waste also makes up another big
component.
[SPEAKER_10]: This ends up being turned into mulch
that's used by grounds on pathways and on
[SPEAKER_10]: garden beds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprisingly scrap metal is 9%,
electronic scrap 5%, and used furniture
[SPEAKER_10]: about 2%.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an other category which is over
100 tons.
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprisingly here used oil, whether it's
cooking oil or motor and pump oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Used cooking oil 54%, used motor oil 22%,
batteries 12%, and tires 12%.
[SPEAKER_10]: So who's in charge of all this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cornell University's R5 Operations and
Waste Management and we are just delighted
[SPEAKER_10]: this morning to have two representatives
of that group here with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Spring Fond and George Wood.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you ever wanted to be a groupie,
these are folks you want to tail around
[SPEAKER_10]: because they really do great stuff and we
should all know who they are and be very
[SPEAKER_10]: admiring of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is their website.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything you want to know about waste at
Cornell you can probably find it on this
[SPEAKER_10]: website.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here they are, Spring and George,
and they're always thinking about how to
[SPEAKER_10]: do a better job of managing waste at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_10]: So where does all of our waste go?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well the landfill waste, which is a huge
amount, over 3,000 tons, Casella,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is a local company, takes it to
Seneca Metal Landfill up in Waterloo,
[SPEAKER_10]: New York.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a 400 acre operation that is
at the north end of Cuyahoga and Seneca
[SPEAKER_10]: Lakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also, our compost is done on site,
on campus.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Farm Services does this and it's a
commercial size operation.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have an institute, the Cornell
Waste Management Institute at Cornell does
[SPEAKER_10]: research on all aspects of composting,
both looking at commercial stuff,
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at how to compost dairy cows and
dead deer that they find on the road.
[SPEAKER_10]: They offer all sorts of services to
citizens and families across the country,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe, I don't know, Miss New York State,
about how to do a better job of
[SPEAKER_10]: composting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our single stream recycle goes to the
Tompkins County Salad Waste, scrap metal,
[SPEAKER_10]: a bunch of different vendors, electronic
scrap, Sun King and Fort New York,
[SPEAKER_10]: reused furniture, who would have ever
thought, 57 tons.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of it goes into a public auction.
[SPEAKER_10]: At Cornell we have a used furniture
inventory and a Cornell asset transfer
[SPEAKER_10]: program where if departments or units,
colleges have access to furniture,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's ways to find out if other units or
colleges can use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we don't end up taking it to the
landfill.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also give stuff to community reuse
programs and then finally, dump and run.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the program that in the spring,
when students are moving out in the spring
[SPEAKER_10]: term, they can collect all of their excess
furniture and clothing and appliances and
[SPEAKER_10]: just unbelievable things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stored, sorted and stored over summer
and then in August, the first weekend when
[SPEAKER_10]: Cornell students come back, particularly
first year students, they can then buy
[SPEAKER_10]: these items and it avoids putting them
into the landfill.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're wondering what happens to the
cooking oil, it goes to National Oil
[SPEAKER_10]: Recycling in North Rose, New York.
[SPEAKER_10]: They use motor and pump oil to York,
Pennsylvania, mattresses.
[SPEAKER_10]: They get reused at university sleep
products.
[SPEAKER_10]: Eight tons of wood pellets go to a company
in Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_10]: Batteries, seven tons to a national outfit
called NLR.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tires, Casella distributes them to
companies to make into athletic turf and
[SPEAKER_10]: bedding mulch.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not much but mulch.
[SPEAKER_10]: There were new compost rules that started
August 15th and the new rules on the
[SPEAKER_10]: Cornell campus say food scraps only.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing you can put in our yellow
compost bins are food scraps and you might
[SPEAKER_10]: say, all right, so many other things will
compost, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the problem is contamination and our
dining halls and everybody who tries to
[SPEAKER_10]: compost on the large scale has a problem
with people who throw things in there that
[SPEAKER_10]: shouldn't be composted.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, what we're now saying is
things like the compostable cups and even
[SPEAKER_10]: things like paper cups that say container
and paper plates that you might think
[SPEAKER_10]: would be compostable and all that
wonderful compostable plasticware,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it cannot go into compost.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it doesn't really compost.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is from Seneca Compost and what
you see is just tons of stuff that's in
[SPEAKER_10]: their compost that doesn't break down,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's the solution to this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if we keep doing it, Seneca Compost
and other companies that do compost,
[SPEAKER_10]: they just refuse to take it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Cornell dining is stuck with the
compostable materials.
[SPEAKER_10]: What to do with it, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So the solution is Cornell is no longer
accepting things like the silverware.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody takes it because it doesn't
compost, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you do food scraps at home and it
goes through conference county food
[SPEAKER_10]: scraps, which goes to Kayuga Compost,
they won't take it either.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know how Cornell does it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now the question is, well,
why should we really care about this?
[SPEAKER_10]: And how do we compare with other countries
and other parts of the US?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm turning it over to my colleague,
Annika.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the next few minutes, I would like
to talk about the waste management or the
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers we just heard about compared to
the rest of the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to start with this table.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this table summarizes the proportion
of waste which is properly disposed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it shows the numbers from all of
America in 2012.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to point out two numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first number,
[SPEAKER_08]: are the plastics we produce on an everyday
basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can see here that only 8.8% are
actually properly disposed.
[SPEAKER_08]: This means the other 92% end on landfills.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same is here with the food scraps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only 4.8% of all food scrap ends up in
composting facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: This means 95% of all organics end up
either in a landfill or get burdened with
[SPEAKER_08]: an incinerator.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was very surprised and shocked by
the slow numbers because it would be very
[SPEAKER_08]: easy for us just to compost properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how does this, just a reminder,
relate to Cornell?
[SPEAKER_08]: So 79% of all our waste goes either in
recycling or composting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in comparison to Cornell, the United
States, only 35% of our waste gets
[SPEAKER_08]: properly disposed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But why does it matter if organics end up
in a landfill or in a composting facility?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the issue is when we, or you know the
process in a composting facility is if you
[SPEAKER_08]: pour organics, displace organics in
composting facilities, then they get
[SPEAKER_08]: decomposed under aerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And CO2 is released.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this CO2 is part of the natural
short-term carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you put it in a landfill,
the conditions there are anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this means next to CO2, also methane
and nitrous oxide are produced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are very bad greenhouse gas
gases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how bad they actually are,
you can see here in this table.
[SPEAKER_08]: It shows a global warming potential of
greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And under global warming potential,
we understand potential of a given
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouse gas in comparison to carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_08]: And methane is 25% verse and 25 times
verse, and nitrous oxide actually around
[SPEAKER_08]: 300 times.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this actually results then in this
chart.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are US greenhouse gas emissions from
waste management streams in the US from
[SPEAKER_08]: 1990 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Y-axis shows emissions in million
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see that the majority of
greenhouse gases comes from landfill.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because it's anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's followed by wastewater treatment by
around 50% to 20%.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's so much because it's also
happening under anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that composting actually has a tiny
fraction of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to now just look at the
methane production emissions from
[SPEAKER_08]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 20.2%.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the third largest source of
methane emitted in the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I give you all the numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we actually look at the
percentage of the greenhouse gases which
[SPEAKER_08]: are emitted from the waste streams in
comparison to all the emitted greenhouse
[SPEAKER_08]: gases, it only makes 2.5%.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this number is tiny.
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably you think, why should we
care?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a special tiny percentage.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, however, every penny counts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, these 2.5% are very easy to
be reduced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone of us can contribute by
deciding on composting to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on that, I hand over to Lana.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: So talking specifically about Cornell,
we know that 75% of the waste is not taken
[SPEAKER_09]: to the landfill.
[SPEAKER_09]: But keep in mind, this includes manure and
pruning waste.
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously, nobody sends that to the
landfill.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can do a lot better than that still.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that we want you to
take with you today is that recycling is
[SPEAKER_09]: great for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is not going to solve our problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: So granted, recycling can reduce waste
sent to landfills and incinerators.
[SPEAKER_09]: For many products, it results in a lot
less energy needed to produce new things
[SPEAKER_09]: in comparison to using raw or virgin
materials.
[SPEAKER_09]: It creates jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all love to create jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the recycled products can also be sold
to other end users for cheaper than the
[SPEAKER_09]: raw materials.
[SPEAKER_09]: And depending on the material that we're
talking about, recycling can save energy
[SPEAKER_09]: when processed into new things from
recycled materials.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can see here, materials like glass,
not a huge energy save.
[SPEAKER_09]: But aluminum cans and copper wire are way
more significant.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're talking about reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions, we can see
[SPEAKER_09]: things like copper wire steel cans and
certain plastics can really help in
[SPEAKER_09]: reducing the greenhouse gas emissions
associated with making things from new
[SPEAKER_09]: plastics.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, things like office paper,
which we do consume a lot of and normally
[SPEAKER_09]: think, oh, we'll just recycle it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually takes, produces greenhouse
gases to recycle paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something that we need to start
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was the biggest finding for me,
which should not have been surprising.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was really shocking for me to read
that recycling is actually really
[SPEAKER_09]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we talk about only money,
it costs the city a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_09]: recycle things, usually because it implies
transportation, storage, sorting,
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, things like cheap oil
prices and really expensive labor
[SPEAKER_09]: contribute to it not being very
sustainable to recycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this comes from a paper which is
actually the only paper that I found that
[SPEAKER_09]: actually analyzes recycling from an
economic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they found was that if society
recycles 10% of its waste and if that 10%
[SPEAKER_09]: of its waste is majority metal,
it's actually a good thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the higher the proportion of the
recycling that happens, the more expensive
[SPEAKER_09]: it is for the city and for society in
general to do this recycling.
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind that if we are in certain
places like the United States of America,
[SPEAKER_09]: all this recycled product also gets
transported to places like China to be
[SPEAKER_09]: processed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a huge cost to recycling that
we don't really see and that we need to
[SPEAKER_09]: start thinking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we found this cartoon which we thought
was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Reference to the Titanic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't get that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though we don't see the trash,
it is always there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to share with you a story that
I thought about this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of years ago in my hometown,
a tiny little city called Bogotá,
[SPEAKER_09]: Colombia, around seven million people were
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a political crisis that led to
trash not being picked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so all of a sudden, these spoiled
people that got their trash picked up
[SPEAKER_09]: three times a week were not getting their
trash picked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would still put it down on the
street, but nobody was picking it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And within two weeks, people started
writing about how they never saw their
[SPEAKER_09]: trash and seeing their trash for the first
time and smelling it and seeing what comes
[SPEAKER_09]: with it was a really huge lesson to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe we should start cutting down our
trash too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the big takeaway from the seminar we
want is for you guys, all of us,
[SPEAKER_09]: to reduce.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the big first R, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And we should start thinking about it
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And reduce usually means buying less.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then we know it's hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you just can't afford to not buy
the six pack of peppers of wet men that
[SPEAKER_09]: comes in that awful non-recyclable bag.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we should try to reuse.
[SPEAKER_09]: And instead of coming up with new plastic
baggies, we should try to reuse the ones
[SPEAKER_09]: we already have.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, we can still optimize
recycling.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Anika pointed out, only 8% of the
plastic ends up being recycled.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can definitely do better.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then of course, if you want to bring
reusable plates to your picnics,
[SPEAKER_09]: we totally support that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of stuff happening on
campus that we may not see just because it
[SPEAKER_09]: is not in every room with the normal blue
recycling bins.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have plastic bag and film
recycling, which you have to go up to the
[SPEAKER_09]: client science loading dock or to the mail
room to find.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have composting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have battery recycling and electronics
recycling, which sometimes you don't see.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, you have to go search for
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only two places I know of are Helen
Newman and Rice Hall, where you can
[SPEAKER_09]: actually leave your old mouse that doesn't
work and your battery charger that broke
[SPEAKER_09]: down.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's also really cool
initiatives going on, mostly led by
[SPEAKER_09]: students.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Cornell Environmental Collaborative,
they go by EECO, is actually this huge
[SPEAKER_09]: group that gathers all the organizations
on campus that do environmentally focused
[SPEAKER_09]: activities.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's also the Cornell Food
Recovery Network, which I did not know
[SPEAKER_09]: about and are absolutely brilliant.
[SPEAKER_09]: They go to the dining halls and they
repackage the food that's already been
[SPEAKER_09]: prepared and then distribute it to the
food vendors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to go beyond Cornell,
there's other stuff that we can all do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like we've already probably told you a
million times, bring your own cup,
[SPEAKER_09]: cutlery, and plates to seminar and coffee
break.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you start doing it for lunch every
day, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a great opportunity to teach
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have the experience during Apple
Fest, where I taught somebody that his
[SPEAKER_09]: cider cup was not compostable and he was
totally heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I taught him.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all see it happening around campus all
the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: People just don't pay attention and they
just toss their bottles or their can in
[SPEAKER_09]: the first day they come across.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just a matter of saying to that
person, hey, maybe you should pay
[SPEAKER_09]: attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a recycling bin next door.
[SPEAKER_09]: I found this recently and I thought it was
really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can opt out of receiving junk mail and
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to ask for junk mail and
catalogs, but apparently you can tell them
[SPEAKER_09]: that you don't want it, because that makes
more sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you go to this website, they take
care of all the actual contacting for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just enter your address and tell them
you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I figured I would throw this in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can all drive less and walk a little
bit more, maybe even quite more.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've also set up this email account.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're hoping to become a resource for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody on waste-related things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have any questions, feel free to
email us and we'll do our best to respond.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there's two more things I want to say
before we wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: One is we are always looking for new
members and volunteers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are interested in getting
involved in any way in any capacity,
[SPEAKER_09]: please let us know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can either email us, talk to us at the
end.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have a sign.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have a sign.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're also going to do a little
activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: So underneath most chairs, but not all of
them, we left a little present.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the idea is you reach under your chair
and find your little present.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to walk across the room and
try to find it.
There are more presents than people.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to find where to put it,
where to put that toe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to look around the room and
place it in its appropriate place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you can talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have two experts here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to keep saying food scraps only,
even though your heart knows and your mind
[SPEAKER_10]: knows it's composting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at Pornhub.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the other item?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Custodian.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two custodians.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy and Larry.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a used light bulb,
find the custodian and they have special
[SPEAKER_10]: places to put them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter if it's fluorescent,
if it's an LED, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: All light bulbs go to the custodians.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not put them in the landfill.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you try to put it in one of the trash
things, you get electrocuted.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually on our hands, but it's
actually flat out against the wall because
[SPEAKER_06]: we're such a large institution.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to recycle them in a special way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can talk about light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably the main reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did other people have real, I mean,
I saw people struggling over little pieces
[SPEAKER_10]: of wood like you stir your coffee.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Spring said landfill,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It is hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be compostable, but we've got to
hold the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Janet, a question for Minnie and for
the waste management booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed this and learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great to do a better job.
[SPEAKER_03]: A better job of what to do with our waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are also initiatives on campus
to reduce the amount of purchasing that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing, the amount of packaging we
get with all of our, I mean, W.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mason sends me, you put in an order one
day, you get four boxes, each with a
[SPEAKER_03]: little item in it the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just seems like there's ways of
reducing, not just doing a better job of
[SPEAKER_03]: recycling, but how do we actually reduce
the amount of waste we're getting on
[SPEAKER_03]: campus?
[SPEAKER_10]: And Spring's probably spent 10 hours a day
thinking exactly about those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a few things going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few things happening around
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one is the present sustainable campus
committee has a procurement team that is
[SPEAKER_06]: working on sustainable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can everybody hear the Geneva microphone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you all hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Geneva.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's the present sustainable campus
committee.
[SPEAKER_06]: The present sustainable campus committee
has 10 focus teams around sustainable
[SPEAKER_06]: issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those teams is waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also one of those teams is
procurement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they are focusing very hard on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things they have done before
W.B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mason went with Staples is, for example,
you couldn't place an order for less than
[SPEAKER_06]: $50 to try to force departments to group
their orders so that they only send the
[SPEAKER_06]: one box.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will admit that I started getting my
feet into the procurement world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be getting deeper over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the conversations are happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we rebid the furniture bid last year
for the first time in like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was great because we had all these
people there talking about making sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that our vendors can supply us furniture
with lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: So George and I will both tell you that
one of our big gripes is all the modular
[SPEAKER_06]: furniture.
[SPEAKER_06]: People think it's Legos, but it's all wall
hung and panel hung.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you start taking it apart,
you end up losing a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So trying to ensure that we have things
that are easily movable and can be used in
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple different ways and not just like
the one way.
[SPEAKER_06]: No question, if you go to a recycling
seminar, the number one habit conversation
[SPEAKER_06]: is procurement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what you buy is in turn what you
are getting rid of.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of that is getting people to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jane knows about our mini bin,
George's mini bin program.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been working on reducing the size of
trash containers and having people
[SPEAKER_06]: self-carry them to several points so that
people think about what they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done building audits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we find is most of that waste is
actually people bringing stuff in for
[SPEAKER_06]: lunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're outside of laboratory
spaces and things like that, you see a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of food-related waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me point out, a lot of that material
is we've done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see much food.
[SPEAKER_06]: People do eat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when these guys are on you about
Tupperware, I swear Tupperware is the
[SPEAKER_06]: answer.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that we know the least
about is the plastic that you call films,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Plastic films.
[SPEAKER_10]: Technical word.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we do have plastic films that you can
dispose of.
[SPEAKER_10]: And import on first and second floors.
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is, what qualifies as a film?
[SPEAKER_10]: So give us the technical.
[SPEAKER_10]: Film?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Films.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recycling of film or plastics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be crinkly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was looking for something that was
crinkly in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a crinkly right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is crinkly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to be landfill, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it crinkles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like cellophane, so crinkly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, this is the best way we've
found.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've looked nationally at how people
describe the difference between recyclable
[SPEAKER_06]: film and non-recyclable film.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not labeled.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the folks over at County Recycling told
me that
[SPEAKER_06]: segment's pasta thingies.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even electronics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They told me that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's single stream.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it'll hold form, you can put it in
single stream recycling.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it holds form.
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes in a plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's soft like this, it goes in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So bubble wrap can go in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that plastic that kids' toys come in
that cuts you when you try to open it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's single stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only plastic that we frequently get
that doesn't go in single stream that is
[SPEAKER_10]: hard is styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next landfill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is landfill in the Northeast United
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have anywhere to send it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a place in Portland and
then somewhere in England.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not shipping it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's too fluffy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the shipping of it does not
counterbalance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll hear about Walmart, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe you want to say this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Walmart does a really good job with
their styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because since they're driving their own
truck, they back haul it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they condense it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they ship it overseas to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're just shipping for shipping's
sake, there's no value in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does Cornell recycle patented
styrofoam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you know you're using it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd calculate styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the truth is, there's actually a very
limited amount of styrofoam on campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: The computer equipment is what people most
associate with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dell is working on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working very hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's our main contractor for
computer supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dell is working on cardboard packaging
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of the styrofoam that we see on
campus is due to laboratory, where I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: sorry to gross anybody out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're shipping part of a dead
thing, you have to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in such cases, we don't want to
recycle that anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't have a better option right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a question back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Cornell dining halls, we're doing
the disposable trays and utensils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're still doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because of the drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Droughts trumps waste right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how has that affected the loads of
waste?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to not make us look so good
this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: What Cornell dining told me was it is
taking a giant bite out of their budget.
[SPEAKER_10]: The landfill waste from the dining halls
is threatened.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am on the drought committee.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am on two of the drought committees.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was the first one to say,
sometimes you have to make a choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of those times.
[SPEAKER_06]: The drought is quite serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they still doing that?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hoping things are going to get
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have a three o'clock on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if things don't improve, what it is
doing is it is helping us keep the drought
[SPEAKER_06]: water consumption on campus by 20%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, we're having to balance
better to meals there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Lori also wanted to remind
everybody that Tompkins County recycle and
[SPEAKER_10]: waste will help you dispose of most
everything and put it in the appropriate
[SPEAKER_10]: place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And most of it is free, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, unless you have huge amounts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you have freezers or things like
that, they charge you a fee.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you have questions about home
waste, Tompkins County recycles them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we buy them?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can answer that.
[SPEAKER_06]: For campus, the costs are about the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our procurement group over the years has
been able to contract a very good price
[SPEAKER_06]: for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're just seeing them, a lot of what
you're seeing are ones that people still
[SPEAKER_06]: have.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new compost change went into effect
last month.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's still a lot of material out
there that simply hasn't been used up yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go back to plastic instead of
compostable.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing you'll notice, though,
is it's really hard to tell the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is a part of the problem is that
it's hard to tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Cornell Dining started last December
in certain dining halls, seeing what the
[SPEAKER_06]: difference is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in post-consumer, where customers
are sorting stuff after they use,
[SPEAKER_06]: almost 50% of the compost had to be
rejected.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the hope is that by having the stream
be consistent, we'll hopefully be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually catch more compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's also easier for departments
if they're having events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the idea with the food only to
mainly negate all of that stuff that is
[SPEAKER_00]: claims biodegradable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a labeling issue due to policy
making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can they label it as biodegradable?
[SPEAKER_06]: So why they can label it as biodegradable
is because it breaks down over x many
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, I don't think, great answers
on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So compostable is a little different
because it's different chemically for the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big challenge, as far as why we go to
food scraps and napkins only, are two
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is those compostable plastics don't
break down very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other piece is total
contamination.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you go out to Cornell Compost
facility, they've always cut the dining
[SPEAKER_06]: compost separate because they can't use it
except on their own fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's little forks and knives
and Pepsi bottles sticking out of it all
[SPEAKER_06]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't put it under the tool up in
the day hall and then just put it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other thing is, and you guys let
me know if this isn't right because this
[SPEAKER_06]: is something I've heard but I've never
actually seen documentation on,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is that the compostable plastics off
yields more methane than regular plastics
[SPEAKER_06]: when they break down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happens is, also with campus using
all sorts of compostable plastics all
[SPEAKER_06]: over, you're only capturing what people
properly use in the dining hall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means as soon as they walk out and
they go all over campus, they're putting
[SPEAKER_06]: in recycling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're contaminating the recycling
bins because compostable plastics aren't
[SPEAKER_06]: recyclable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're all, so that material's
ending up in the landfill and it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: doing more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't help the recycling industry
at all if we're just contaminating and
[SPEAKER_05]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got another question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lean into my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So recycling, I know compost you can
contaminate it and if you contaminate it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you send it to the landfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the same with recycling?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recycling gets hand sorted down in
Tompkins County, which is why,
[SPEAKER_06]: and anyone here work in labs very often?
[SPEAKER_06]: Labs or clinical spaces?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had to work really hard in labs
where people want to do the right thing
[SPEAKER_06]: and then say, oh, this feels metal and
it'll recycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, A, that's against the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: But B, people are hand sorting this
material.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't want people being exposed to
whatever goes on in the labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So compost, however, there's no sorting
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us on campus, it gets hand sorted at
Tompkins County.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that, and they capture the high
value materials, the high value plastics,
[SPEAKER_06]: the high value paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of how the county funds the
recycling program.
[SPEAKER_06]: What they don't, gets mixed in with our
residential recycling, which goes to
[SPEAKER_06]: Ontario County.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ontario County.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't use Seneca Meadows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of my questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a gripe against Seneca Meadows.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not so great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they get sorted again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where there's people, but then there's
also magnets and lasers and all this cool
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that does better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a national?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that everywhere?
[SPEAKER_05]: Recycling gets hand sorted?
[SPEAKER_06]: In general, it's always hand sorted,
one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are actually really, really lucky that
we have both a wonderful county and we
[SPEAKER_06]: have a really, really good vendor.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to Tioga County, which is 20
miles south, they don't, their programs
[SPEAKER_06]: are different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have a great amount of
inconsistency, not just state by state,
[SPEAKER_06]: but county by county.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you're aware of that,
but Vendable actually sortings through the
[SPEAKER_08]: compost every day to get all the compost
and compost nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Vendable's owner, I'm forgetting her
name, she's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she pays her employees to hand sort
the compost, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: The compost because people, to hand sort
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: To make sure that what she sends out of
there is properly sorted.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's paying a lot to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think the question managing such as
the center, the community better than
[SPEAKER_06]: other places, what's the advantages and
the disadvantages in community?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do we do a better job?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm wondering if we do a better job
if we compare.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you compare, so we have some,
there's some other colleges out there that
[SPEAKER_06]: do better than we do, straight up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're out there, Rutgers, Espanola,
and different ones do better for different
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: It very much relies on the community,
we very much rely on our community and our
[SPEAKER_06]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first off, Tonkins County is amazing
and their director is Barbara Rackstrom
[SPEAKER_06]: who is- Cornell graduate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Cornell graduate and it has been her
passion in life.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been working on this since the 80s
and has programs where as a resident,
[SPEAKER_06]: I pay for trash but my recycling's free.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also have laws in place to
acquire companies to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're really lucky that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also have, for a land-grade
institution, we have a lot of commitment
[SPEAKER_06]: as an institution to do the right thing
and use the campus as a living lab and
[SPEAKER_06]: that is fantastic as someone who's a part
of this place because we have buy-in and
[SPEAKER_06]: support team members from departments all
over campus and that helps us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, at Cornell, only about a
third of staff drive to campus alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, about 90% of students
contribute by bike or walk-in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that way, I think we may be the
best.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much to presenters and
to visiting guests.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was really fascinating and I
encourage you to recycle and repurpose
[SPEAKER_07]: these discussions outside so we can get
ready for the next occupant that we wrote.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
