[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Mike Scanlon, say hi Mike.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I are really, really happy to be here
today for the undergraduate symposium for
[SPEAKER_18]: the plant sciences majors and friends.
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a fantastic class this year,
our plant science 4950 course.
[SPEAKER_18]: All of these students were involved in the
class.
[SPEAKER_18]: They worked really hard putting their
presentations together.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're happy to have everyone here
today to see the results of not only the
[SPEAKER_18]: hard work during class to put this
presentation together, but the results of
[SPEAKER_18]: the research and extension experiences
that our students have had that both Mike
[SPEAKER_18]: and I find to be amazing and inspiring.
[SPEAKER_18]: The first talk today is actually not from
one of our undergraduates, but from the
[SPEAKER_18]: recipient of the SELU fellowship.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, SELU fellowship.
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost said Denison, sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Grant Thompson.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that fellowship Grant will talk about
a little bit, but it's about undergraduate
[SPEAKER_18]: mentoring.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Grant is a graduate student in Jenny
Cow-Niffin's lab.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he will be actually starting an
assistant professor position at Iowa State
[SPEAKER_18]: University fairly soon, about which he is
not in any way nervous.
[SPEAKER_18]: Grant's undergraduate student that he
worked with is Michelle Chen.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the two of them today will give us a
brief overview of the work that they did.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll begin the students that
were involved in our class.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Grant and Michelle, please come on up.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the clicker should work.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I failed miserably, Mike.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: The title is Reflections on Mentoring a
Learning Laboratory for Grads and
[SPEAKER_18]: Undergrads.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm Grant Thompson.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as was mentioned, the title for this
is Reflecting on Mentoring a Learning
[SPEAKER_14]: Laboratory for Grads and Undergrads.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'll give a little bit of
background overall, talk a little about
[SPEAKER_14]: the SELU fellowship and mentoring.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really more than just the research
that we've done together.
[SPEAKER_14]: Give some of my perspectives and Michelle
will give hers on it and kind of the
[SPEAKER_14]: important experiences we've walked away
from this.
[SPEAKER_14]: The research, which you actually won't be
hearing a whole lot about, is part of the
[SPEAKER_14]: Baltimore Ecosystem Study.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is an experiment or part of a
longer running experiment looking at land
[SPEAKER_14]: use change in urban grasslands and how
that is affecting soil microbiomes and
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of the various controls on that that
we see.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this work that we've done together has
been supported by the generous donation of
[SPEAKER_14]: the SELU family for the Excellence in
Mentoring Fellowship.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was endowed by Mark and Lisa SELU of
Pride's Corner Farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's $50,000 annually to one recipient,
a graduate student, in each of the five
[SPEAKER_14]: sections of SIPs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's for students who have
demonstrated previous and ongoing
[SPEAKER_14]: commitment to mentoring of undergraduate
researchers.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been really critical for me this past
year for the support that I've had,
[SPEAKER_14]: both in finishing my dissertation and
working with Michelle.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just been a fantastic experience.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so as I've mentioned, it's more than
just the research.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, there's all of the training
that goes along into it, showing Michelle
[SPEAKER_14]: how to do PCR, take lab notes,
amplify DNA, quantify what we've had.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's also a process of building
relationships and inspiring the next
[SPEAKER_14]: generation students who are going out into
research careers, into academia,
[SPEAKER_14]: into wherever life takes them after
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what this has been able to do is have
allowed me kind of a more focused and
[SPEAKER_14]: intentional approach to what I've been
doing in the lab for years, working with
[SPEAKER_14]: undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we've had a series of regular
weekly meetings, checking in, kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: seeing about progress, talking about
pitfalls, troubleshooting hurdles,
[SPEAKER_14]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a graduate student, most of the
time, I'm focused on the research end of
[SPEAKER_14]: things, communicating my science to my
peers, to my advisors at conferences,
[SPEAKER_14]: talking to extension audiences.
[SPEAKER_14]: So really, working with an undergraduate
researcher has forced me to kind of slow
[SPEAKER_14]: down, reflect, and think about my own
science, about how I approach things that
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe now it's kind of not automatic,
but certainly ingrained in me that I don't
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of think about those things as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also given me a lot of really
valuable lessons in terms of what is
[SPEAKER_14]: appropriate goal setting?
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you motivate a student who's
experiencing challenges in the lab?
[SPEAKER_14]: How do they move forward with their own
time management?
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really a lot about leadership and
people skills, and frankly admitting when
[SPEAKER_14]: things aren't always going well.
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're having trouble in the lab,
OK, what's not working?
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I do to change that?
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I think that's a really important
thing that I've walked away from this
[SPEAKER_14]: experience with.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really helped me form and kind of
solidify my teaching and mentoring
[SPEAKER_14]: philosophies, which I've had to articulate
quite a few times over the past year as
[SPEAKER_14]: I've applied for different professor
positions at various institutions.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've had a lot of really fantastic
mentors in my career.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really been an opportunity for me
to pay it forward and give back,
[SPEAKER_14]: working very closely with Michelle,
as well as undergrads that I haven't
[SPEAKER_14]: passed.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here to talk about my experience with
us.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is my second year in Dr.
Gannigan's lab.
[SPEAKER_21]: So prior to this, I worked with all of the
students in the lab.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a bunch of different PhD students.
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I really got to enjoy from this
mentorship was the ability to go beyond
[SPEAKER_21]: just working with, like, dancing off with
different students to really focusing and
[SPEAKER_21]: working primarily with Grant on his
projects, the Baltimore Law and Study.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so last semester, I worked for his
research.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then this semester, I got to sort of
have my own project with us.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really got to be in charge and
experience all the challenges and joys of
[SPEAKER_21]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was an opportunity for me to really see
the bigger part in research.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, I don't have as much of a background
in plant science.
[SPEAKER_21]: So asking Grant questions, how does my
work fit directly into his project and
[SPEAKER_21]: into the bigger Baltimore Law and Study?
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing all of that sort of pieced together
and like tell the bigger story was really
[SPEAKER_21]: interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, part of the mentorship was just
asking him about, like, about research,
[SPEAKER_21]: about graduate student life.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, like, he's graduating this
spring.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really got to see all of the work
that he put into his dissertation,
[SPEAKER_21]: his final, final, like, exams and his exit
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_21]: So really getting to see potentially if I
really want to go into research,
[SPEAKER_21]: how might my life be?
[SPEAKER_21]: And also just like developing,
like, relationship with the mentor,
[SPEAKER_21]: not only in research, but in my career and
life advice.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I got to, when I was applying for
internships earlier this winter,
[SPEAKER_21]: I talked to him about how to phrase
certain applications, how to really
[SPEAKER_21]: articulate my interests and my career
desires.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that actually worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so just to wrap it up, I think,
you know, we all maybe take for granted or
[SPEAKER_14]: just kind of intuitively understand the
value of mentoring and the support that it
[SPEAKER_14]: takes to be able to provide good
mentorship.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's a fantastic opportunity
for undergraduates and graduates.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we both have learned a ton from
each other and just kind of going through
[SPEAKER_14]: the process of working together.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think one of the important
things when it comes to mentorship is not
[SPEAKER_14]: only the informal process, but having
people to check in with, having kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe a formalized way to get feedback
about how mentoring can be improved.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've had, I've checked in with a
number of people and just kind of done so
[SPEAKER_14]: informally, but I think any way that we
can formalize that moving forward would be
[SPEAKER_14]: good.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just really wanted to say thank you
very much to the Seller family for their
[SPEAKER_14]: support.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been fantastic this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Michelle will be going to Rutgers this
summer for a research experience.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as was already stated, I'll be joining
Iowa State.
[SPEAKER_14]: So certainly this experience has been
really formative and other people think so
[SPEAKER_14]: too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: The title of Rico SOC is Plant and
Pathogen Wars Outside the Cell,
[SPEAKER_18]: the xDNA's system.
[SPEAKER_19]: So hi everyone, I'm Rico Lin and I'm a
plant pathology and plant microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a plant pathology concentration.
[SPEAKER_19]: Today I'm going to present some of my work
at Professor Gillian Turgisla studying
[SPEAKER_19]: fungal genetics and genomics.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the topic of my today's talk is plant
and pathogen wars outside the cell,
[SPEAKER_19]: the actual cellular DNA, actual cellular
DNA system.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when we talk about DNA, we usually
think of it as a molecule that carries
[SPEAKER_19]: genetic information and usually resides in
the nucleus or other organelles.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this idea of intracellular DNA,
it's radically overturned with the
[SPEAKER_19]: discovery of the neutrophil actual
cellular trap.
[SPEAKER_19]: So neutrophil is a type of human immune
cell that normally looks like this.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when they encounter a microbial
pathogen, they can flatten themselves and
[SPEAKER_19]: secrete DNA outside the cell to form this
web-like material to trap microbial
[SPEAKER_19]: pathogen to immobilize them and prevent
them from further infection.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this mechanism is also actually
discovered in plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was discovered that extracellular
DNA can be secreted by plant root tips.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's shown here is that showing reds
and also pointed by the black arrow is the
[SPEAKER_19]: P root tip.
[SPEAKER_19]: And showing green is fungal hyphae of a
plant fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And pointed by the white arrows is the
slime layer that's composed of DNA and
[SPEAKER_19]: other proteins.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this slime layer is separating the
fungal hyphae from approaching the plant
[SPEAKER_19]: root tips to continue infection.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we treat this system with pure
DNAs one, this will happen.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this slime layer will be loosened.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fungal hyphae can now penetrate
through the DNA complex and reach the
[SPEAKER_19]: plant root tip to cause 100% root rot.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as it happens a lot between host and
pathogen interactions, when a plant or
[SPEAKER_19]: mammalian host come up with a defense
mechanism, the pathogens always comes up
[SPEAKER_19]: with a counter defense.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in this case, it's the extracellular
DNA secreted by microbial pathogens.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was discovered that mammalian
bacterial pathogens can secrete DNA
[SPEAKER_19]: outside the cell to chew up these
neutrophils secreted DNA and release
[SPEAKER_19]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they can continue the infection.
[SPEAKER_19]: And a similar mechanism is also discovered
in plant bacterial pathogens.
[SPEAKER_19]: But they can secrete DNAs outside the cell
to chew up the plant secreted
[SPEAKER_19]: extracellular DNA.
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there hasn't been any reports on
whether or not fungal pathogens can
[SPEAKER_19]: secrete extracellular DNA as a counter
defense against plant secreted
[SPEAKER_19]: extracellular DNA.
[SPEAKER_19]: So our lab is asking the question,
whether this counter defense mechanism is
[SPEAKER_19]: also present in the plant fungal system.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the model fungus that we're using is
Cocleobus heterostrophis, which is a
[SPEAKER_19]: necrotrophic corn pathogen that causes
southern corn leaf blight.
[SPEAKER_19]: And to study the extracellular DNA system
in Cocleobus heterostrophis, we use
[SPEAKER_19]: bioinformatics tools to generate 30
candidate genes that are encoding DNAs in
[SPEAKER_19]: the fungal genome.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then if it's encoding actually in our
DNAs, whether it is secreted or not will
[SPEAKER_19]: be important.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we analyze them for secretion and
picked the ones with the predicted
[SPEAKER_19]: secretion signals.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so far, we've analyzed eight of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they are all marked in pink here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And among the eight candidates,
one was identified as important for
[SPEAKER_19]: virulence.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, it had secreted DNAs activity,
which is marked in green here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the protein ID of this gene is
1-4-4-2-0-6.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in my project, I am screening another
candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the protein ID is 1-9-7-6-3-2 to see
if it also encodes the extracellular DNA's
[SPEAKER_19]: gene.
[SPEAKER_19]: To study this gene, I generated mutants
with this gene deleted in my fungus.
[SPEAKER_19]: And firstly, I performed a virulence
assay.
[SPEAKER_19]: I inoculated corns with four different
strains.
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one is the wild type.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also the second one is a positive
control, which is a mutant with the
[SPEAKER_19]: identified secreted DNA's gene deleted,
delta 1-4-4-2-0-6.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other two are my mutants that are
lacking my gene of interest, 1-9-7-6-3-2.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I collected the leaves of my
infected corns and measured the legion
[SPEAKER_19]: lengths of every legion on the third leaf
of my corns.
[SPEAKER_19]: And used average legion lengths as a
criterion for virulence.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you can see that this is a symptom,
of course, infected by wild type.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is a zoom picture of one of the
legions.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the symptoms caused by the
positive control.
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you can see, and based on
statistical tests, the virulence of the
[SPEAKER_19]: mutants is significantly decreased
compared to wild type.
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the difference of virulence
between the wild type and two of my
[SPEAKER_19]: mutants wasn't significant, which
indicates that this 1-9-7-6-3-2 is likely
[SPEAKER_19]: not a virulence factor.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we're still interested in why,
whether this 1-9-7-6-3-2 is encoding an
[SPEAKER_19]: Axis or a DNA8.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I also performed a DNA8 activity test.
[SPEAKER_19]: I cultivated these trees and collected
media from the cultures and made spore
[SPEAKER_19]: suspension and put equal amounts of spore
suspension in two individual eppendorf
[SPEAKER_19]: tubes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And added six surface sterilized core leaf
pieces into one of the tube and incubated
[SPEAKER_19]: both of the tubes at room temperature with
gentle shaking for three days.
[SPEAKER_19]: And after three days, I centrifuged both
of these cultures and used a field trace
[SPEAKER_19]: to treat lambda DNA to see if there's a
difference between lambda DNA digestion.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if the gene is encoding for an Axis or
a DNA8, this is the result that we're
[SPEAKER_19]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_19]: So all the trials contain lambda DNA here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is what lambda DNA originally
looked like without any treatment.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when it's treated with DNAase 1,
there's nothing left when it's treated
[SPEAKER_19]: with DNAase 1.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when they are treated with the wild
type field trace, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_19]: that the lambda DNA is no longer intact or
less intact, indicating that the lambda
[SPEAKER_19]: DNA is digested.
[SPEAKER_19]: And these two lines are treated with field
trace of wild type culture cultivated with
[SPEAKER_19]: core leaves.
[SPEAKER_19]: And these two are treated with cultures of
wild type cultures without core leaves.
[SPEAKER_19]: As you can see, there's an increased
amount of DNAase activity in these two
[SPEAKER_19]: lines, which indicates that there's an
association between the presence of core
[SPEAKER_19]: leaves and also the DNAase activity.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we treat lambda DNA with the
positive control, which are mutants
[SPEAKER_19]: lacking 1, 4, 4, 2, 0, 6, we can see that
compared to wild type, there's a decreased
[SPEAKER_19]: amount of lambda DNA digestion,
indicating that this gene is encoding for
[SPEAKER_19]: an Axis or DNAase, because lacking this
gene will make a decreased amount of DNA
[SPEAKER_19]: digestion.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I apply the same assay to my mutants,
and this is the result that I got.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is lambda DNA by itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when it's treated with pure DNAase 1,
and this is wild type.
[SPEAKER_19]: And these last four lines are my mutants.
[SPEAKER_19]: I treat it with my mutants, and as you can
see, there's no obvious decrease of DNAase
[SPEAKER_19]: activity.
[SPEAKER_19]: However, you might also notice that in the
positive control here, that there's also
[SPEAKER_19]: not an obvious decrease in DNAase
activity, which I have to be honest that
[SPEAKER_19]: these tests are quite crude.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's variation between each trial,
indicating that there's many unknown
[SPEAKER_19]: factors in our experimental design.
[SPEAKER_19]: Which we are still trying to improve.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is definitely not an easy task,
because there's little literature
[SPEAKER_19]: associated with filamentous fungi encoding
DNAase, not to mention about functional
[SPEAKER_19]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we're definitely still trying.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, this is not the end of story,
because I also performed a phylogenetics
[SPEAKER_19]: analysis of DNAase encoding genes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Using bioinformatics tool, we identified
the orthologs of the identified secreted
[SPEAKER_19]: DNAase in cochlear oblast 1, 4,
4, 2, 0, 6, and found its orthologs in
[SPEAKER_19]: other plant fungal pathogens, such as
cochlear oblast Victoria, which is an old
[SPEAKER_19]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're asking the question,
do orthologs of 1, 4, 4, 2, 0,
[SPEAKER_19]: 6 has similar function in other pathogens?
[SPEAKER_19]: We're asking whether it has similar
functions in another pathogen that infects
[SPEAKER_19]: another host, and also infects another
plant part, because C.
[SPEAKER_19]: Victoria is actually a Crohn pathogen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have generated mutants of C.
[SPEAKER_19]: Victoria lacking this ortholog,
and I am performing the virulence assays
[SPEAKER_19]: recently.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in conclusion, according to our
virulence test, 1, 9, 7, 6, 3,
[SPEAKER_19]: 2 is likely not a virulence factor.
[SPEAKER_19]: And according to our DNAase test,
1, 9, 7, 6, 3, 2 might not be a secreted
[SPEAKER_19]: DNAase.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have a lot of future research going
on.
[SPEAKER_19]: One is that we are, as I mentioned before,
we're improving the DNAase assay in order
[SPEAKER_19]: to get a more consistent result.
[SPEAKER_19]: And secondly, as I mentioned, there's an
association between the presence of corn
[SPEAKER_19]: leaves and the increased DNAase activity.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're asking whether the presence of
corn leaf is inducing the DNAase activity,
[SPEAKER_19]: or is it simply that because of the
presence of corn leaf, there's better
[SPEAKER_19]: fungal growth?
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, we have a lot more candidates to
analyze, and many of them are still under
[SPEAKER_19]: current research.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I am studying the ortholog of 1,
4, 4, 2, 0, 6 in Cochlearops week 3,
[SPEAKER_19]: and I am assaying the virulence of my
mutants in recent days.
[SPEAKER_19]: And last but not least, I also want to
mention that in the meantime of this
[SPEAKER_19]: project, I also adapted CRISPR-Cas9 system
to Cochlearopolis hydrostrophos,
[SPEAKER_19]: and I'm improving this so that in future
research, hopefully, we can use it to
[SPEAKER_19]: study, to do more site-specific research
on functional analysis on the identified
[SPEAKER_19]: DNAase gene.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to thank everyone in the Turgen
lab, especially my PI, Gillen,
[SPEAKER_19]: and also our postdoc, Heejin Park,
who have helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also I want to thank all my funding
sources, the RCPRS program, the Gene Brody
[SPEAKER_19]: Undergraduate Research Award, and
Frederick Geppler Memorial Research
[SPEAKER_19]: Endowment.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now I would like to take questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: Questions for Rico.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.
[SPEAKER_23]: So one would expect that this phenomenon
of being able to degrade DNA as DNA is
[SPEAKER_23]: produced by root caps, that would be
something more maybe expressed in the root
[SPEAKER_23]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_23]: Why did you choose to study a foliar
pathogen?
[SPEAKER_19]: So when we first studied our identified
acrosol DNAase gene, which is 1,4406,
[SPEAKER_19]: we actually performed a root assay to
evaluate the virulence.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also performed a foliar assay by
evaluating the virulence on the plant
[SPEAKER_19]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_19]: And both of them show decreased amount of
virulence.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're suspecting it could also be
acrosol DNAase or DNA could also be
[SPEAKER_19]: secreted by leaf.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also cocculalbus has a trophus,
although it's mostly a foliar pathogen,
[SPEAKER_19]: but sometimes it can also de facto root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_18]: So next, we have Jay Winans, who will be
talking on phenotypic variants and disease
[SPEAKER_18]: severity caused by Fusarium graminiarum
sampled from wheat and wild grasses.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the work I'm going to be
presenting today, is the work I did for my
[SPEAKER_13]: honors thesis on Fusarium graminiarum
collected from Northeastern New York.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit of background, Fusarium
graminiarum is an Ascomycete plant
[SPEAKER_13]: pathogen that infects both wheat,
barley, and corn.
[SPEAKER_13]: When it's infecting wheat and barley,
it causes Fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a picture of wheat that's infected
the white and bleached stem is the
[SPEAKER_13]: infected part.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the sooty, moldish area is the
infected gibberella ear rot that causes
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Consumption of this fungus can lead to
vomiting, malnutrition, a lot of health
[SPEAKER_13]: concerns for humans and livestock both.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason for that is because of the
mycotoxins this fungus produces.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it produces a bunch of different
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_13]: On the right here, I have the lecture
structure of six of them, but that isn't
[SPEAKER_13]: an inclusive list.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are all incredibly potent
mycotoxins, so one part per million,
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's dangerous for people to consume
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're also pretty economically
important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fusarium graminiarum is one of the most
economically important pathogens for wheat
[SPEAKER_13]: production.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in 2014, it was estimated that a
billion dollars were lost due to Fusarium
[SPEAKER_13]: headlight based off of grade loss.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was enough mycotoxins that you
couldn't sell it for human consumption,
[SPEAKER_13]: and livestock is only at 10 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's pretty close to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Once you have infected grain, there's very
little you can do to get rid of it or get
[SPEAKER_13]: rid of the toxins in the grain.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some more background on mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_13]: The synthesis of mycotoxins vary between
populations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the corn belt is dominated by the
15-AD1 phenotype, or chemo type.
[SPEAKER_13]: So normally, a fungus isolate will produce
one mycotoxin in vast quantities more than
[SPEAKER_13]: other ones, or it'll only produce one at
all, and that's called its chemo type.
[SPEAKER_13]: The upstate New York region has much more
diversity in mycotoxins that are produced
[SPEAKER_13]: by isolates, such as the NX2 variety,
the 3-ADON variety, 15-ADON.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are all kind of more present in this
region.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wild grasses are colonized by Fusarium
asymptomatically, so you won't ever see
[SPEAKER_13]: the infected cyclets that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's wheat when you're collecting it
off native grasses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Last mycotoxin accumulation of Fusarium
gramidium, when it's infecting wild
[SPEAKER_13]: grasses as well, but the aggressiveness of
isolates on wheat from different host
[SPEAKER_13]: origins are currently unclear.
[SPEAKER_13]: So with all this information in mind,
my question for my thesis was,
[SPEAKER_13]: is there a significant difference in the
phenotype and disease aggressiveness when
[SPEAKER_13]: you sample Fusarium off of wild grasses
and when you sample Fusarium off of wheat?
[SPEAKER_13]: So would you see a difference in chemo
type identified?
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you see a difference in disease
aggressiveness, mycelia growth,
[SPEAKER_13]: or parathesia formation?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to get into the methods
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: The collection sites we had were way up
here in northeastern New York,
[SPEAKER_13]: way past agriculture.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of the agriculture for wheat is in
this area, so then all of a sudden around
[SPEAKER_13]: here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are the four different sites we
went to, and this is an enhanced version
[SPEAKER_13]: of the Willisboro research farm,
where each pin is a precise marking of a
[SPEAKER_13]: grass isolate that we grab, and then all
the wheat isolates we grab from this part,
[SPEAKER_13]: from wheat.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in total we had 20 isolates from grass,
eight from smooth-grown, eight from canary
[SPEAKER_13]: reed grass, and four from orchard,
and then 15 from wheat, all collected
[SPEAKER_13]: around here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I ran the greenhouse experiment.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was a live host inoculations to
test disease severity of incidence.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the greenhouse I had two lab
standard checks, or I had to run three
[SPEAKER_13]: different inoculations just because of
spatial restrictions in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I would inoculate them,
and then every week or the next month I
[SPEAKER_13]: would go back and I would take a incidence
and severity rating, just is a disease
[SPEAKER_13]: there, and if it is, how bad is it?
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on the fourth week I brought them
all back to the lab, brushed them,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then did a percentage of damage
kernels.
[SPEAKER_13]: The damage kernels get really orange and
purple compared to the healthy kernels.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also did in lab a spore elation assay
and a mycelia growth, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So parathisia is the reproductive
structures of prusarium, and these are
[SPEAKER_13]: little black dots here, those are
parathisia.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right here this is an mycelia growth
assay, just seeing after five days how
[SPEAKER_13]: large of a colony did it produce.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was kind of the methods,
now we're going to jump into the results.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the chemotyping we found 15-3-ADON
mycotoxin, 18-15-ADON and one nivalenol,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is a pretty standard split for this
area we collected it from.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chemotypes had no significant effect on
any of the phenotypes observed,
[SPEAKER_13]: whether it be spore production,
mycelia growth, disease in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_13]: and damage kernels.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we did see was that the origin of
the isolate, so if you grabbed it from a
[SPEAKER_13]: grass isolate or from wheat, that had a
significant effect on whether it caused a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of disease or less disease in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we see that the final disease rating I
took, and so this graph right here,
[SPEAKER_13]: this is the final disease rating I took,
and the psorium damage kernels,
[SPEAKER_13]: and that's the correlation just good,
just knowing that the two different ways I
[SPEAKER_13]: was measuring disease, those are
correlated pretty well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then this regression line is for the
grass isolates, and this one is for the
[SPEAKER_13]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, right, so this is the final
disease rating here.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's interesting was that while this was
significant, the psorium damage kernels
[SPEAKER_13]: was not related, it was not significant
that the place you took the isolate from
[SPEAKER_13]: was not significant for predicting damage
kernels, which is weird because this is
[SPEAKER_13]: correlated, and this was significant,
but that wasn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that might be because my theory is
that I had for this one, there was four
[SPEAKER_13]: data points, but then for this one it was
one and one, because this was over a
[SPEAKER_13]: month.
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving forward to the mycelia and
parathisia growth.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I found a trend, so this is not
significant, but this does kind of show
[SPEAKER_13]: that there is some sort of significance
that if maybe with a higher sample size we
[SPEAKER_13]: could see a significant effect,
which I think is interesting because it
[SPEAKER_13]: does show that maybe there's a difference
between whether you're growing larger or
[SPEAKER_13]: you're producing more spores.
[SPEAKER_13]: That could show that there's a difference
in life patterns.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the inflation of these results.
[SPEAKER_13]: Grass isolates cause less disease,
and that could indicate differing in host
[SPEAKER_13]: edification.
[SPEAKER_13]: Negative relationship between mycelia
growth and parathisia formation is a
[SPEAKER_13]: dissent, and chemo-type not being
associated with its neurotoxin production
[SPEAKER_13]: is unimportant in colonizing of these
wheat hosts.
[SPEAKER_13]: For further research, I'm going to be
moving to Madison when the summer is over,
[SPEAKER_13]: but before then I'll be working on
differentiation between NX isolates and
[SPEAKER_13]: re-IDLN.
[SPEAKER_13]: So on this graph, what I'm showing here is
that these bars down here, this is the
[SPEAKER_13]: re-IDLN from up there, this one is the 15,
and then this one up here is the
[SPEAKER_13]: nivalenol.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, re-IDLN and NX does not
differentiate with this, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_13]: want to do that and see if that can have
an effect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Larger sample size to see if parathisia
formation and mycelia growth, if those are
[SPEAKER_13]: different.
[SPEAKER_13]: They really do have a negative correlation
to each other.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to give a high performance
look at the photography to see exactly how
[SPEAKER_13]: much mycotoxins are being produced by the
grass isolates when they're affecting
[SPEAKER_13]: wheat and the wheat isolates when they're
affecting mycelia.
[SPEAKER_13]: We tried this once, but the spore
suspension completely destroyed every
[SPEAKER_13]: single seedling that we tried to
inoculate.
[SPEAKER_13]: With that, I'd like to acknowledge Michael
Fulcher, a grad student that I've been
[SPEAKER_13]: working with for about two years now,
personal mentor of mine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie Cummings, a really great lab
manager.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Gary Bergstrom, who is my PI.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Denise Ackerman here for all the help
with the statistics for this thesis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Chad Thomas, who helped me grow all
the greenhouse plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, I'd like to make your time
and answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question back here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious as to what parts of the world
where they grow wheat have the greatest
[SPEAKER_12]: problem with fusarium and what contributes
to that being a greater problem in those
[SPEAKER_12]: areas.
[SPEAKER_13]: So fusarium is kind of a worldwide
problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or in the United States, most of the
mycotoxins are screened for and then are
[SPEAKER_13]: separated and not sold for consumption.
[SPEAKER_13]: In developing countries in Africa,
I know that fusarium is a pretty big
[SPEAKER_13]: problem because it's not screened for well
enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: So people are ingesting infected grains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: So I should point out when you see the
presenters smile, it's because they're
[SPEAKER_18]: looking at Mike or I, and they're talking
about something that was discussed
[SPEAKER_18]: extensively in class.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so far, I have to say both presenters
have done the best job of presentation to
[SPEAKER_18]: date was today.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're off to an excellent start.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so next we have Kyra Archer.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the title of Kyra's talk, if she
didn't change it, is role and elucidation,
[SPEAKER_18]: role elucidation of terpene synthase TPS2
in maize aphid defense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a plant science major and also
nutritional science major.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a project that I did for my
honors thesis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to talk with you all about
it today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as Chris said, I'm going to talk to you
about a specific enzyme, TPS2,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the role of this enzyme in maize
defense, specifically against corn leaf
[SPEAKER_07]: aphids and green peach aphids.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all know that maize is a very
important crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, maize experiences such
a wide range of herbivory, from foam
[SPEAKER_07]: feeding to chewing and stem boring.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just can't catch a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what's more interesting than
evaluating all of these different insects
[SPEAKER_07]: that feed is the way that the plant
naturally defends itself against all of
[SPEAKER_07]: these insects.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And today I'm going to talk with you about
one in particular, the use of volatile
[SPEAKER_07]: organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So VOCs are not only defensive compounds,
but they can be used to attract
[SPEAKER_07]: pollinators, like bees.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they are used in defense,
they're used indirectly or directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indirectly is when it attracts natural
enemies of herbivores, like parasitic
[SPEAKER_07]: wasps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And directly is when it deters things like
caterpillars and aphids from actually
[SPEAKER_07]: feeding on the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I mentioned this enzyme,
TPS2.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're probably wondering,
what does this have to do with VOCs?
[SPEAKER_07]: So TPS2 is an enzyme that was found by a
previous postdoc in my lab to experience a
[SPEAKER_07]: significant gene upregulation in response
to aphid feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: And whenever we see this, in an RNA-seq
analysis, we think, OK, maybe it's playing
[SPEAKER_07]: a role in defense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And further elucidation of this enzyme is
found that the primary products are
[SPEAKER_07]: linalool, narrowlittle, and gerinal
linalool, which are all VOCs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I became really interested in this
because the natural next question is,
[SPEAKER_07]: let's see if these compounds are playing a
direct role in defense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can test each one of them,
maybe there's a specific one in particular
[SPEAKER_07]: that aphids are being attracted to,
or deterred.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just a GC analysis that was
conducted by a postdoc who found TPS2.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is showing that the wild type
line that we have, which is a DS knockout
[SPEAKER_07]: line, does not have the same volatile
peaks for linalool, DMT, TMTT,
[SPEAKER_07]: and narrowlittle as the wild type W22,
which is a maize inbred line that was used
[SPEAKER_07]: to make this knockout.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I had a variety of different
methods for trying to answer this
[SPEAKER_07]: question, what is TPS2 doing in defense?
[SPEAKER_07]: And could linalool, narrowlittle,
and gerinal linalool be involved in this
[SPEAKER_07]: event?
[SPEAKER_07]: The first was a choice assay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this assay was meant to see if aphids
were exhibiting a general preference
[SPEAKER_07]: towards the TPS2 knockout line or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second was olfactory assays,
which appeal to the aphid sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was meant to determine if
linalool, narrowlittle, or gerinal
[SPEAKER_07]: linalool were directly causing some sort
of defense or attraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the final, which was my favorite,
was electrical penetration grab assay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was meant to see if aphid feeding
duration, pattern, and frequency were
[SPEAKER_07]: altered in response to these volatile
compounds that are present in TPS2.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the choice assay is pretty
self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_07]: I planted W22 plant next to the knockout
line that we had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I put about 20 aphids in the center of
the plant and caged it and timed it for 20
[SPEAKER_07]: hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I counted where the aphids chose
to go, if it was on the W22 or the TPS2.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason I chose 20 hours is because
a graph that I have later that I can show
[SPEAKER_07]: you if you want shows that the gene
expression of TPS2 is highest between 18
[SPEAKER_07]: and 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it makes sense to evaluate the aphids
within a 24-hour period.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the results for this were pretty
surprising, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the knockout line, we see that aphids
weren't actually that into it compared to
[SPEAKER_07]: the wild type line, W22.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I talked about volatiles before as
potentially acting as direct or indirect
[SPEAKER_07]: defense mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what we're seeing here is the
volatiles that are present in the wild
[SPEAKER_07]: type line and not in the knockout are
actually encouraging the aphids to come to
[SPEAKER_07]: the wild type.
[SPEAKER_07]: So after getting these results,
I thought, OK, maybe I need to re-evaluate
[SPEAKER_07]: my hypothesis and look at these volatiles,
linalole, neralole, and gerinal linalole
[SPEAKER_07]: as attractants and not as defense
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next thing I did was the olfactory
assay.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to watch aphids move around the
glass tube for three minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially what I did is I put them in
the center, and then I introduced the
[SPEAKER_07]: volatile here and tracked their movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very crude setup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the future, this will probably be
repeated with a Y tube, which controls for
[SPEAKER_07]: pressure and airflow to prevent any other
volatiles from being in the system and to
[SPEAKER_07]: also control the amount that they're
actually being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the results for this were also quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we see gerinal linalole here,
neralole, and linalole all show general
[SPEAKER_07]: movement towards.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, based on this data that I
collected and data that I've collected
[SPEAKER_07]: previously using R-mitis, I would deem
gerinal linalole as a potential attractant
[SPEAKER_07]: because although this isn't statistically
significant, I've done many more
[SPEAKER_07]: replicates of this experiment,
and we do see aphids migrating far more
[SPEAKER_07]: towards gerinal linalole than away.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next guy is neralole.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would deem this a very clear
attractant for the aphids.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason being, of all of these guys
that I tested, the amount of aphids that
[SPEAKER_07]: made a choice or didn't just stay put in
the tube was the highest for neralole at
[SPEAKER_07]: all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about 65%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see a highly statistically
significant movement towards the volatile
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than away, which makes me think
that it's an attractant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And linalole is unconfirmed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although this graph looks very promising,
that the aphids clearly seem to want to
[SPEAKER_07]: move towards volatile, previous data that
I've done with R-mitis did not find this
[SPEAKER_07]: at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually found that the aphids are
moving about as equally toward as away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And only 10% of the aphids made a choice
in this situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't deem that enough to say that
this could be an attractant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the final assay that I did was the
electrical penetration graph assay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how this works is you have an aphid
attached to a probe here, which is
[SPEAKER_07]: attached to a device that basically
amplifies the different voltage potentials
[SPEAKER_07]: that happen when an aphid stylet is
inserted into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this amplification gets stored in a
computer, and I get a nice set of
[SPEAKER_07]: waveforms I can analyze.
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially what this is doing is
creating a massive circuit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're tracking the difference in
voltage potential and determining where in
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant the aphid is feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to show you what I
actually have to do for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the aphid here, and it is attached
with silver glue to a gold wire that's
[SPEAKER_07]: probably as thin as a hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this wire is attached with silver glue
to a copper wire, which is then soldered
[SPEAKER_07]: to a brass insect pin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this pin then goes into the probe that
I showed before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the aphid starts feeding,
the circuit's complete, and you have data
[SPEAKER_07]: that you can analyze.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the experiment in action.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the actual aphid right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this machine can take up to eight
plants at once.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did about 30 plants for each line,
and it takes a long time to analyze the
[SPEAKER_07]: data, so it was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very cool machine, and definitely
my favorite part about doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, even though all of this
is really cool, the results weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: actually that significant for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I separated the results into four
different types.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first being an assessment of the
non-probing behavior of the aphid,
[SPEAKER_07]: meaning when it's not feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second being a pathway phase behavior,
which is basically preparation for feeding
[SPEAKER_07]: or salivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The third being xylem phase feeding,
or just inserting the xylem into the
[SPEAKER_07]: xylem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fourth, which is what we really
care about, is the phloem feeding,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is when the aphid is actually
ingesting phloem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see, for non-probing and
pathway phase behavior, these results are
[SPEAKER_07]: not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty similar to one another in
terms of the TPS2 knockout on a wild type.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for xylem and phloem phase feeding,
we also see very similar results.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at first I was a bit discouraged by
this, but when I thought about it a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit more, I think that this could just be
indicating that the TPS2 enzyme is not
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily playing a role in aphid
feeding behavior, but more of a role in
[SPEAKER_07]: attracting the aphid to the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once it's there, it'll just feed on
its own and do its own thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the main takeaways of my project,
I wanna first reintroduce the goal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the goal was to determine what role
this TPS2 enzyme is playing in May's aphid
[SPEAKER_07]: defense, specifically if the byproducts of
this enzyme were serving as attractants,
[SPEAKER_07]: or deterring the aphid, or if something
else was going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And based on the results that I found,
you see that aphids do seem to be favoring
[SPEAKER_07]: the wild type line, which has the
volatiles present, over the knockout,
[SPEAKER_07]: which would indicate some sort of
attractive mechanism going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we move forward and look at
the actual volatiles, we see that
[SPEAKER_07]: narrowlittle and general linalool could be
clear attractants to where the aphid,
[SPEAKER_07]: linalool would have to do more work to
assess that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, because the EPG results
weren't as conclusive, one could determine
[SPEAKER_07]: that the role of TPS2 is not to encourage
feeding behavior, but to encourage aphid
[SPEAKER_07]: attraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a lot of people I'd like to
thank.
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost, George, Jan,
my PI.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my postdoc, Annette Richter,
for helping me throughout this whole
[SPEAKER_07]: project.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in this lab for four years now,
so it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to thank the ASPB education
and outreach team for giving me the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity to present this preliminary
data for this research last year and fund
[SPEAKER_07]: this project.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Hunter Rawlings III Presidential
Research Scholars for funding my research
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout my time at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to know how you glue that onto the
little aphid.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're not going to go into that.
[SPEAKER_25]: That was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm a corn breeder.
[SPEAKER_25]: So my question, of course, is if you shut
this TPS2 down, what are the downsides for
[SPEAKER_25]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that wasn't part of your research,
but what other things besides maybe
[SPEAKER_25]: attracting aphids could it be doing for
the corn plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the main issue that could arise is
when you shut down this enzyme,
[SPEAKER_07]: other terpenes could be created from the
substrates of the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, the scope of my project
did not research those terpenes,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that was my secondary hypothesis,
is that those terpenes could actually be
[SPEAKER_07]: influencing the attraction or detersion of
the aphid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you either could see maybe a difference
in aphid behavior, but what you would more
[SPEAKER_07]: likely see is a difference in plant
behavior.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I think we're ready.
[SPEAKER_18]: Next, we have Samantha Hackett,
and she will be talking about lead and
[SPEAKER_18]: arsenic uptake by radishes in contaminated
orchard soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about contaminated land.
Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did the soil get contaminated?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are pesticides that are used for
orchard soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a common practice for these
pesticides to be used from about like the
[SPEAKER_03]: 1920s to 1950s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this land was past orchard soil,
and it's still prevalent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going anywhere because it's
rather immobile, which is a good thing and
[SPEAKER_03]: a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get any sort of water sources,
but you can't really farm on it with much
[SPEAKER_03]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, there's other areas that
are impacted, not just old orchard soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was leaded gasoline that was very
common.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still prevalent throughout the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so like urban soils are always a
concern also.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a picture of some land that is
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really tell because it's just a
bunch of soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But continuing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So health effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we even care about these lovely
toxic metals?
[SPEAKER_03]: So arsenic is very critical when it deals
with the nervous system and cardiovascular
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will cause those to fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also with lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will cause developmental behavioral
problems, especially in children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also affect your cognitive
function and then eventually lead to
[SPEAKER_03]: death.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cellular uptake of arsenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So arsenic is a physiological toxic metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's going to be taken up through
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So arsenic 5, it looks really similar to
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then arsenic 5 can turn into arsenic
3.
[SPEAKER_03]: In anaerobic soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arsenic 5 is also then going to be tightly
bound to these soil particles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So leaving it immobile in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because it looks so similar to
phosphate, it's going to be taken up
[SPEAKER_03]: through the cell by a phosphate
transporter there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's also going to be then
transitioned to arsenic 3 by reductase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from here, it's going to either
be stored in a vacuole or it's going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: into the xylem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just go through multiple other cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically repeat this whole process over
and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our hope is that then some plants will
store more arsenic in its vacuoles versus
[SPEAKER_03]: having it be taken up through the plant to
higher places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some other ways that it's taken up can
vary from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like rice is going to have an SI
channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it varies as you go through
different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lead is a particulate contaminant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that basically the physical
particles, if it's on those leaves or on
[SPEAKER_03]: that piece of vegetable that you're trying
to eat, that's how you would get lead
[SPEAKER_03]: ingested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a concern because we're growing
radishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Radishes are in direct contact with soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also a concern with lettuce and
much other vegetables and produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other concerns that we have are where
is it actually in the soil profile?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to be in the upper layer or
lower layer?
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, because we're working with
pesticides, it is in the upper layer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also the contact exposure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, do you have something over that
surface of freshly tilled soil and such?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also a plant anatomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we harvesting the corn that's under
the husk?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are we harvesting the radish root
that's right in contact with the soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then soil pH also does vary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with my particular research,
I had 12 pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only difference was that half were
fertilized with compost, checking manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other half were just plain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then planted radishes in all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of just highlighted the things that
were either trending or significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on Europe and Asia's standards
for lead and arsenic, they have one PPM
[SPEAKER_03]: for lead and then also five PPM for
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's for dry weights of vegetable or
produce that you would be consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's considered like safe value.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are over that, yippee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first thing, arsenic is what
we're kind of hoping for the fertilizer to
[SPEAKER_03]: compete with phosphate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's showing a trend, but not yet
significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was hoping that if I fertilize it
more, then there would be more competition
[SPEAKER_03]: with that uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for lead with leaves in the
second harvest between fertilized and not
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilized, that was significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one was with the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's in better contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is showing a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since there lead is a particulate
contaminant, we wanted to show that
[SPEAKER_03]: difference between lead and arsenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did a correlation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is specifically looking at lead
and aluminum and leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is looking at the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't show the arsenic because there
wasn't a correlation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see here with this trend line
that there is a correlation with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just going forward, that's consistent
with other research.
[SPEAKER_03]: The options for remediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We chose a composted fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of just hitting those two bullets
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can choose either or.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different options for
research and experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also looking at other production of
life stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're hoping to do was analyze the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, that should take a while to
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so instead of growing radishes and
hoping to eat the actual radishes,
[SPEAKER_03]: we could just produce the seeds and then
sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all options.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to try to fight going around that
contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some acknowledgments that I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Summary with Brian, my professor,
and supervising me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He spent a lot of time also gathering the
soil and doing all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was awesome to get firsthand
knowledge from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Hannah was the postdoc in this
hub.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was super helpful to Filment Hill,
unfortunately, for their contaminated
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also the greenhouse staff for
being so nice and helping me with watering
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are references that weren't from my
own pictures and such.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Question.
[SPEAKER_16]: Has anyone investigated uptake from things
like lead-based paints?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that occurs around houses and
people have a garden there and so forth.
[SPEAKER_16]: So is it going to the plants that way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with lead specifically based,
that is a concern, obviously, because then
[SPEAKER_03]: that's affecting so many urban soils and
then also suburban soils and such.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those are so large, the concern is
really when they start getting really
[SPEAKER_03]: small and broken up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the concern is then is that going to
be directly on to your whatever you're
[SPEAKER_03]: eating or if the child is eating or
whoever's eating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can be amended with washing
regimens or removing that top layer of
[SPEAKER_03]: soil or just removing those chips of
paint.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of research on it because
there was such a scare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people got basically sick from
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a ton of research on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're looking at specifically
what plants and crops are safe to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: with those types of soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that you talked about more of
the soil effects on the uptake,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I was curious on if we know anything
about what whether or not the plant has
[SPEAKER_09]: control once it's in the cell on whether
or not you can store it in vacuoles rather
[SPEAKER_09]: than going off to the harvested parts of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to vary species to
species, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants don't want it in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's typically toxic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some plants that will just take
up an abundant amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are kind of not considered
excluders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that people usually use
to try to remove the toxic metals from the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But besides that, so it's very common for
the plants to stop it at the flowering and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeding or flowering and fruiting phase
because that's their offspring and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want any other toxic things to go
into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's common for that uptake to
basically halt at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where like growing corn or
beans and stuff like that is better for
[SPEAKER_03]: like seen as more of a solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why like permaculture is a very
common thing in those soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like why the orchards are still able
to grow on those lands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in your results, there was like a 23
something, but it was plus or minus 17.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to like ask you how you explain
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so those are basically the averages of
all of my results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the plus and minus was a standard
deviation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_18]: Why was it so variable is this question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it so variable?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I'd have to look at it
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a plus or minus 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess because out of those six,
I had a number of radishes like harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just like one from each pot,
but it was like six or seven from each pot
[SPEAKER_03]: and then trying to reach that weight goal
that was necessary for the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of, I guess,
I need to look at the specific number.
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.
All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Next, we have Alison Comber.
[SPEAKER_18]: Alison's the title of Alison's talk is
diseases in forest storage, intercropping
[SPEAKER_18]: systems and Alison.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a December 2018 graduate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this project is ongoing and I'm working
on the data collection pretty much
[SPEAKER_04]: starting next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my presentation is going to be a little
bit of different format than everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: else's.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to start with an overview of
the problem that my project is meant to
[SPEAKER_04]: address here in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a very large dairy industry in
organic dairy production.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's growing in order to support dairy
cows.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use forages as animal feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by extension, a lot of forage crops are
grown in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forage production is becoming increasingly
more important as organic production
[SPEAKER_04]: spreads because there are certain
requirements for organic producers to use
[SPEAKER_04]: a certain amount of fresh feed that has to
come from forages, which it's easier to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow them locally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So forage production continues to expand,
but it is being threatened by extreme
[SPEAKER_04]: weather events in our area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see from this graph on the
right, we've had a 71% increase in extreme
[SPEAKER_04]: weather events or very heavy precipitation
in the Northeast in 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these weather events have caused a lot
of damage to forage production in our
[SPEAKER_04]: region.
[SPEAKER_04]: And intercropping has been proposed as a
mechanism to buffer forage production from
[SPEAKER_04]: these extreme weather events.
[SPEAKER_04]: So intercropping is part of a bigger
scheme called system resilience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is increasing the system's
tolerance to extreme weather events and
[SPEAKER_04]: different environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So intercropping falls under the
absorptive capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is increasing tolerance of the
system by diversifying your crop and
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially not putting all your eggs in
one basket.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also other ways to make your
system more resilient.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the adaptive capacity, so opening
up your cropping system to more
[SPEAKER_04]: management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strategies such as introducing tile
drainage or irrigation to cope with
[SPEAKER_04]: weather events that are sort of new to the
area that you're starting to see more of
[SPEAKER_04]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also the restorative capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this involves recovering from a crop
failure with external support.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be things such as crop
insurance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a closer look at intercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Intercropping is the practice of sowing
multiple crops in the same field at the
[SPEAKER_04]: same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you can see a strip intercropping
system where you have maize, soybean,
[SPEAKER_04]: and oat that are all grown in alternating
strips.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially the idea with this in terms
of system resilience is that if you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: really tough year for soybeans,
so you have a lot of one pest or the
[SPEAKER_04]: weather's not great and you see a failure
of your soybean crop, two-thirds of your
[SPEAKER_04]: field is not soybean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you don't have complete failure
because you can rely on your maize and oat
[SPEAKER_04]: crop to support you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are several different types of
intercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I just showed is strip,
which you can see here on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more alternating types such as row
strip and row, which you'll see in a
[SPEAKER_04]: push-pull system.
[SPEAKER_04]: The system of intercropping that this
project uses is mixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the seeds are essentially put
together at the beginning and then planted
[SPEAKER_04]: out randomly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the objective of my study is to
determine the prevalence of pathogens in
[SPEAKER_04]: these diverse organic forage systems that
also include the use of intercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the smaller questions that I'm
looking at is, are we seeing a difference
[SPEAKER_04]: in disease pressure when we have an annual
intercropping system versus a perennial
[SPEAKER_04]: intercropping system?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we seeing a difference in disease
pressure when we have multiple susceptible
[SPEAKER_04]: species present versus one susceptible
species to a disease?
[SPEAKER_04]: And are we seeing a difference in disease
pressure when we have a plot with one
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivar or a plot with cultivars that
have varying resistance?
[SPEAKER_04]: So some may have high resistance to the
pathogen and others might be very
[SPEAKER_04]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this year we have about 12 crops that
are involved in this different
[SPEAKER_04]: intercropping system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the perennial, our main crop is
alfalfa, which is involved in all four
[SPEAKER_04]: different treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the annual, it is triticale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are four different diversity
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: The low diversity consists of one species,
one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: The conspecific treatment is four
different cultivars of one species.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heterospecific treatment is four
different species, one cultivar each.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the high diversity treatment is four
different cultivars of four different
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is part of a larger experiment
called the FIRE trials, which stands for
[SPEAKER_04]: Forage Intercrop Resiliency Experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a large experiment where these
four different diversity levels of both
[SPEAKER_04]: annuals and perennials are being grown by
Matt Ryan's lab group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're looking at how resilient
really is the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're measuring things such as forage
quality and biomass and yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an example of what one block
looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's perennials here and annuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see there's four different
levels of diversity in each.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are five blocks that look like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one of the plots is about 30 by 50
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: This trial is also being replicated at the
University of New Hampshire and the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Vermont, but their plots are
a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's an example of what one of the
blocks looks like for the winter annuals
[SPEAKER_04]: about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see across the four treatments,
there's sort of a variation in the shade
[SPEAKER_04]: of green, which is indicative of the
different mixtures of crops that are
[SPEAKER_04]: present in each treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so far for my methods, last fall I
went out to the fields and collected
[SPEAKER_04]: foliar samples with the intent to identify
some foliar diseases and then compare and
[SPEAKER_04]: check for overwintering this spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this involved collecting foliar tissue
samples and bringing them back to the lab,
[SPEAKER_04]: surface sterilizing the tissue,
cleaning it on PDA, and subculturing the
[SPEAKER_04]: colonies onto fresh plates for
identification.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right, this is polythrinicum on
clover.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is commonly known as city blotch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see, I make sort of that dot
pattern on the clover itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it has kind of a wild snowman
look under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are all of the foliar diseases
that I was able to identify in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to draw your attention to
sarcophagi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are already starting to see some
cross of diseases onto multiple species,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is something that I'm particularly
looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting next week, and then again,
once in the summer and next fall,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be taking both incidence and severity
measurements in each of these plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to, for the incidence
measurements, I'll be placing five
[SPEAKER_04]: quadrats in each plot and looking at
percent of the plants, out of all the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in the quadrat that are infected
with some sort of foliar disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will then repeat this in September.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some folks from Matt Bryant's lab
group are nice enough to do a smaller
[SPEAKER_04]: measurement of this in July while I am
gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the severity measurements will
involve the same laying down five quadrats
[SPEAKER_04]: per plot and using a patrol graph,
such as the one shown here for alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_04]: to estimate the percentage of disease in
each quadrat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just like to thank everyone I
worked with in the Bergstrom lab,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially my PI, Gary Bergstrom,
and the lab manager, Jamie Cummings,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Matt Ryan lab for growing these
plants and fertilizing them and doing all
[SPEAKER_04]: the other wonderful things to help them
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mentor is Mike Fulcher, who's a
graduate student in plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my contact in the Matt Ryan lab is
Anne Biabe-Thinley, who's a graduate
[SPEAKER_04]: student in soil and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to thank the Hash Supplement
for supporting my research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will take any questions.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for that presentation.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm a fan of Matt Ryan's work.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I like the idea of intercropping,
but we want to make it as easy as possible
[SPEAKER_17]: for farmers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's not very easy to deal with
three or more different commodity markets
[SPEAKER_17]: if you want to be able to sell your
season's harvests of corn and soybean and
[SPEAKER_17]: oats.
[SPEAKER_17]: It might be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I like the idea of intercropping.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's quite a lot of phenotypic
diversity within a single crop species.
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there a way for Matt Ryan and others
doing his work to focus more on a single
[SPEAKER_17]: type of commodity market where you're
dealing with cultivars that expand
[SPEAKER_17]: different genotypic diversity and that's
targeted to whatever pest pressures there
[SPEAKER_17]: are or if you're trying to tolerate some
kind of change.
[SPEAKER_17]: And climatic conditions, but just really
have it so that it's diversifying your
[SPEAKER_17]: farm.
[SPEAKER_17]: But also you want to make it easy on the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just if they want to deal with a
single commodity market, then let them.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the ideas are absolutely applicable.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's just simply instead of multiple
crops of species, multiple species of
[SPEAKER_17]: crops, it's just multiple genotypes within
a crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's a couple of things that
the Matt Ryan lab has done to make this
[SPEAKER_04]: conducive for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, first of all, the mixed
intercropping system where everything can
[SPEAKER_04]: be planted together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to do three separate
planting regimens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes it a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also do have the con specific
treatment, which is just different
[SPEAKER_04]: genotypes of one plant, which I think
helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I think is particularly a
struggle with this is the optimal harvest
[SPEAKER_04]: time for each of these forage crops is a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to decide when to harvest the
high diversity forage crop because you
[SPEAKER_04]: might not get the optimal forage quality
of some of the different crops you have in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that versus a corn and
soybean intercrop, the forages are easier
[SPEAKER_04]: to sell in bulk because they're just going
directly towards livestock feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, Alison.
[SPEAKER_18]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Will Dahl,
who also changed the title.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: The title of his talk is CRISPR Cas9 in
Lemna Minor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Will.
[SPEAKER_15]: And today I'll be talking to you about my
efforts to implement CRISPR Cas9 in the
[SPEAKER_15]: duckweed species Lemna Minor.
[SPEAKER_15]: So why am I talking to you about duckweed?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's a small aquatic plant which
grows on the surface of fresh water.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's one of the smallest flowering
plants in the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm dealing with Lemna, which is right in
the middle here.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are five genera with 37 species.
[SPEAKER_15]: And each of them is smaller than a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was recently demoted from its own
family, Lemnaceae, to Lemnoideae,
[SPEAKER_15]: the subfamily of Horaceae.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a recent development.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm right in the middle here with
Lemna Minor.
[SPEAKER_15]: So duckweed is a good candidate for both
bioremediation and biofuels because it has
[SPEAKER_15]: a high tolerance to high nitrogen
concentrations and phosphorus
[SPEAKER_15]: concentrations, which are characteristic
of agricultural runoff and waste water.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can use it in runoff zones to absorb
a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_15]: It also has a very high growth rate.
[SPEAKER_15]: This disputed time of 16 hours is actually
a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has a doubling time of about a day and
a half, four and a half days.
[SPEAKER_15]: So currently, the US produces about half
of the world's biofuels, primarily with
[SPEAKER_15]: corn and soybean.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if we could add another system that
could also be doubly used as a candidate
[SPEAKER_15]: for bioremediation, that would be
effective.
[SPEAKER_15]: So as you can see, it's somewhat of an
invasive species.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a picture from Prospect Park where
it's totally overtaken this area,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's indicative of how quickly it can
actually grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it has a very fast doubling time and it
has a very high lipid content relative to
[SPEAKER_15]: lignin and other contaminants that might
make it difficult to actually remove
[SPEAKER_15]: triacylglycerol and use it for biofuels.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in preliminary assemblies, we found a
lot of orthologs for genes that have been
[SPEAKER_15]: used in other systems to promote
triacylglycerol hyperaccumulation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But duckweed has some challenges
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have a complete picture of all
the genomes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lemna minor is the farthest along,
so we've identified the most genes in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of other strategies used in
Arabidopsis, for instance, aren't going to
[SPEAKER_15]: work very well in duckweed because it
propagates clonally, primarily.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't really use the floral dip stable
expression strategy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And here's a Lemna gibba flower,
which is among the largest species in the
[SPEAKER_15]: genus that I'm working in.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see its pistils and its
anthers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's only about a millimeter to two
millimeters long.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is only produced under very
stressed out conditions.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to find a way to achieve stable
expression.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the first thing that we tried was to
transform the marathym via direct
[SPEAKER_15]: injection.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we tried to develop that with an
artificial microRNA construct.
[SPEAKER_15]: That didn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_15]: The expression was biased towards the
vasculature.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were unable to achieve stable
expression throughout many generations.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're exploiting the callus state,
which is a strategy used by the duckweed,
[SPEAKER_15]: to de-differentiate and accumulate a lot
of carbohydrates in order to avoid abiotic
[SPEAKER_15]: stressors, such as frost.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it de-differentiates into a clump of
tissue that then sinks to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_15]: ponds, where it can avoid being frozen to
death.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we induced the state using hormones and
then transformed the callus using vacuum
[SPEAKER_15]: infiltration.
[SPEAKER_15]: That protocol was also used with the
artificial microRNA construct.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've tried many different promoters.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them, we tried P35S ubiquitin from
maize.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then some native rubisco promoters.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've run into some issues with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're trying different combinations of
promoters as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am trying to promote two small guides
at a time, Cas9, and some associated tags,
[SPEAKER_15]: such as mcherry, which is prepended to the
Cas9.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a nuclear localization motif,
which is also added to the Cas9.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it can be expressed in the nucleus and
actually cut the DNA.
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are three gene targets for my
small guides, which I made it the farthest
[SPEAKER_15]: with.
[SPEAKER_15]: The first is phytoine desaturase,
which is an ortholog from Solanum.
[SPEAKER_15]: And bio-induced gene silencing in
Jatropha, which is another plant that's
[SPEAKER_15]: been used for biofuels applications.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a succulent with high triacylglycerol
content.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has been shown to accumulate tag and
also result in a bleached leaves
[SPEAKER_15]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a sugar-dependent one,
which is actually SDP1, not SPD1,
[SPEAKER_15]: which could be confusing, because that's
seedling class development.
[SPEAKER_15]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually a lipase, which causes the
breakdown of triacylglycerol.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we can knock that out,
we can maintain triacylglycerol
[SPEAKER_15]: concentrations, which are desirable from
other transformations.
[SPEAKER_15]: Such as wrinkled one and diacylglycerol
acyltransferase.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then finally, we have TGD1,
which is trigalactosyl diacylglycerol,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is a transporter.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it can also accumulate triacylglycerol
in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are the three gene targets that I
made the farthest with small guides.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've had some issues actually detecting
Cas9 once I've transformed it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's typically in low abundance.
[SPEAKER_15]: And because of my nuclear localization
signal, it's been hard to actually detect
[SPEAKER_15]: from vegetative tissue.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've extracted nuclei and tried to
detect it directly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I've also tried to optimize Cas9,
because I used SP Cas9, which is optimized
[SPEAKER_15]: around 37 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I actually grew the duckweed at 37
degrees Celsius to make this particular
[SPEAKER_15]: enzyme happier, because the duckweed
doesn't really care about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been using two guide targets in some
situations and one in others.
[SPEAKER_15]: What we would expect to see if one guide
works is an indel at the protospacer
[SPEAKER_15]: adjacent motif.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if two work, we would expect to see a
complete deletion via non-homologous end
[SPEAKER_15]: joining.
[SPEAKER_15]: So to detect Cas9, I've targeted mCherry
with antibodies and also tried to detect
[SPEAKER_15]: my small guides with RT-PCR.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that has so far been a little bit
difficult.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the goal would be to achieve stable
expression of high lipid content,
[SPEAKER_15]: which would result in low carbohydrate
content because of the load of producing
[SPEAKER_15]: proportionally more lipids.
[SPEAKER_15]: We would like to see the growth viability
stay in shape, which would be nice if it
[SPEAKER_15]: could survive accumulating all these
lipids.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to directly detect Cas9,
the small guide, and the higher lipid
[SPEAKER_15]: content.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would result in a bleached leaves
phenotype like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this point, I'm not complete with
the project.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we could have successfully transformed
Cas9 already and had a failure to delete
[SPEAKER_15]: on the pessimistic side.
[SPEAKER_15]: We could also have run into some issues
with the promoters that we're currently
[SPEAKER_15]: using.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the other end of possibility,
I could go back and detect Cas9 and then
[SPEAKER_15]: also detect my small guides and the
deletion, which would be the absolute best
[SPEAKER_15]: case scenario.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have yet to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would be ideal if my small guides
are there, my Cas9 is there, and I
[SPEAKER_15]: actually delete the gene that I want to
delete.
[SPEAKER_15]: So currently, I have seen a bleached
leaves phenotype unique to 37 degrees
[SPEAKER_15]: Celsius transformence.
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully that means that the deletion
is working.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've also detected small guide via
RT-PCR.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I need to redo it because I'm reaching
the end stages of actually detecting all
[SPEAKER_15]: these things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have not yet conclusively detected
all of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cas9 is still difficult to detect.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did my first Western blot on mCherry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so my antibodies might be off.
[SPEAKER_15]: There might be a lot of issues with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my RT-PCRs will detect my small
guides.
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, that's where I'm up to right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to thank my mentor,
JS, my other mentor, Evan, and the
[SPEAKER_15]: Duckweed team, Joe, Almedina, and Uma,
and Alex, who did a lot of work on the
[SPEAKER_15]: artificial microRNAs, and then my PI,
Rob Martinson.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question.
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it's a preliminary result.
[SPEAKER_24]: But about what frequency did you see the
bleached phenotype in your?
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty high, but only for phytoine
desaturase.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd say about 80% for phytoine
desaturase, but no other transformence
[SPEAKER_15]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe I missed this in the beginning
part of your talk, where you outlined the
[SPEAKER_24]: experimental design.
[SPEAKER_24]: But is the goal then to knock these genes
out?
[SPEAKER_24]: Or are you trying to adjust the expression
of these using guide RNAs to the
[SPEAKER_24]: promoters?
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to knock them out for these
three genes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have different strategies for
other genes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've promoted Wrinkled and DGAT.
[SPEAKER_15]: To try and promote triacylglycerol
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But these genes are also associated.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's an already established three gene
strategy for triacylglycerol
[SPEAKER_15]: hyperaccumulation in other systems.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've been kind of following that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are just the genes that I happen
to make it farthest with.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they all happen to be knockouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions for Will?
[SPEAKER_18]: Go, Michael.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love asking molecular biologists an
ecology question.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am fascinated by Lemna, the
duckweeds, and other floating aquatic
[SPEAKER_17]: plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: So is this like a serious bioenergy crop?
[SPEAKER_17]: And what other types of species,
like azolla or some others, are they now
[SPEAKER_17]: targeting for biofuel crops?
[SPEAKER_15]: We think it's serious.
[SPEAKER_15]: We hope it's serious.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been at it for about five years now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Algae seems to be almost a better option
at this point.
[SPEAKER_15]: But right now we're really hoping that
duckweed can do a good job.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it can accumulate biomass so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's also very resistant.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the highest growth rate among the
higher plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully it can do the same thing,
withstand the same conditions that we've
[SPEAKER_15]: seen in detro and actually accumulate the
fats that we needed to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob is pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Will.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Jeffrey Yen.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the title of his talk is Comparative
Legal Development in Poe City.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm a student working in Mike
Scanlon's lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm studying comparative legal
development.
[SPEAKER_09]: And similar to Alison, I'm also a December
2018 graduate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I might not have as much data to
present.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first thing I'd like to talk about is
what is a legal and why we basically care
[SPEAKER_09]: about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we look at a grass leaf, it is composed
of sheath that wraps around the stem and
[SPEAKER_09]: also a corresponding blade portion that
extends away from the stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we look at the region in which the
two intersect, we can define a region
[SPEAKER_09]: called the blade sheath boundary.
[SPEAKER_09]: At this blade sheath boundary,
we have a structure called an archhole
[SPEAKER_09]: here that is a wedge that allows the blade
to extend outwards to maximize light
[SPEAKER_09]: capture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also we have the ligule region,
which is an epidermally derived fringe of
[SPEAKER_09]: tissue on the top side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: So very fundamental question in
developmental biology is the formation of
[SPEAKER_09]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we can see of the shoe epical
mirror stem of a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when a new leaf primordia initiates,
what has to happen is that we have to
[SPEAKER_09]: create a boundary here that separates
domains inside the leaf primordia and the
[SPEAKER_09]: shoe epical mirror stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very similarly in floral development,
we also get formation of boundaries
[SPEAKER_09]: signified here as these green strips of
tissue.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's interesting about this project
is that the ligule is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_09]: at the location of the blade sheath
boundary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we would like to understand how the
formation of ligule development
[SPEAKER_09]: contributes to the establishment of the
blade sheath boundary.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about development,
the first things we'd like to ask about is
[SPEAKER_09]: the elastogeny.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I mean by that is the
developmental sequence in which has to
[SPEAKER_09]: occur for this particular structure to
form.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we have a histological section of
a longitudinal section of a maze epicy in
[SPEAKER_09]: which here we can clearly see that we have
the shoe epical mirror stem and some young
[SPEAKER_09]: leaf primordia that are just initiating.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'd like to bring to your attention
is that as we go further and further away
[SPEAKER_09]: from the shoe epical mirror stem,
the leaves are more mature in
[SPEAKER_09]: developmental age.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can denote its developmental stage by
giving each leaf a plastocron number in
[SPEAKER_09]: which the newly initiated leaf will be
called plastocron number one.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one here will be called
plastocron number two.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the number increases as we get more
and more mature leaf structures.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we can see that in a maze plant,
around plastocron seven, we don't see any
[SPEAKER_09]: morphological changes associated with
ligule formation.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, during plastocron eight,
we get this little tiny bump that's going
[SPEAKER_09]: to correspond to where the ligule is going
to develop.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to give a little bit more insight onto
how this process occurs, we can,
[SPEAKER_09]: here we have the depiction of what just
cells are looking at it at its surface
[SPEAKER_09]: view.
[SPEAKER_09]: What has to happen first is that you get a
series of cell divisions that create these
[SPEAKER_09]: very long cells that are fat in
appearance.
[SPEAKER_09]: On an SCM image, you can see them right
here in which we call this the pre-ligule
[SPEAKER_09]: band.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit later in development,
the pre-ligule band would start dividing
[SPEAKER_09]: parallel to the surface of the leaf,
pushing a layer of cells outwards to
[SPEAKER_09]: create what's called a pre-ligule ridge.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can nicely see the pre-ligule ridge
here on this SCM image, and this structure
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to grow into the mature ligule
structure later in plant development.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of insights have been obtained
through studying the genetics in maze,
[SPEAKER_09]: and here we have a gene of interest called
ligulus one.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we have mutations in ligulus one,
we get plants that lack both the oracle
[SPEAKER_09]: structure and the ligule compared to a
wild type maze plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can also see that the blade sheath
boundary is a lot less distinct compared
[SPEAKER_09]: to wild type plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have mutations in barley and maize,
they create similar phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_09]: suggesting that this gene is very highly
conserved within the grass species.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that brings me to my model organism,
which is in the kind of cloa species,
[SPEAKER_09]: in which if you look at its phenotype,
at least for some members of the genus,
[SPEAKER_09]: it is represented by a lack of ligule
structures yet it has a very nice oracle
[SPEAKER_09]: structure and the blade sheath boundary is
very distinct.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my main question of interest is how can
members in the kind of cloa family not
[SPEAKER_09]: have ligules yet have very nice blade
sheath boundary formation compared to when
[SPEAKER_09]: we have mutations that disrupt the ligule,
the oracle and associated blade sheath
[SPEAKER_09]: boundary is lost in other grass species.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to do that, I'm going to use three
experimental approaches.
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I'm going to examine the
ontological development of Echinocloa and
[SPEAKER_09]: then I'm going to look at candidate gene
expression of known genes in maize and
[SPEAKER_09]: other grass species that are responsible
for ligule development.
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, I'm going to utilize a
transcriptomics approach to identify novel
[SPEAKER_09]: gene elements that might not be present in
other grass species.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first thing I wanted to see is that
if I can directly observe particular
[SPEAKER_09]: cellular differences within these
different developmental domains.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to do that, I use scanning electron
microscopy to look at the blade sheath
[SPEAKER_09]: boundary region and here we can clearly
see that we have three distinct domains,
[SPEAKER_09]: the blade sheath and oracle region.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we look more closely at the cellular
features, we can see that here we have
[SPEAKER_09]: sheath cells and blade cells and you can
see that the sheath cells are
[SPEAKER_09]: characterized by its bumpiness and if we
compare it to oracle cells, we can see
[SPEAKER_09]: that these oracle cells are very
texturized, which corresponds to the
[SPEAKER_09]: secretion of waxy cuticles on the surface.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in order to find out when this blade
sheath boundary occurs in Echinocloa,
[SPEAKER_09]: the first thing I did was to do
histological sectioning to find out if I
[SPEAKER_09]: can find these specific cellular
characteristics associated with sheath and
[SPEAKER_09]: blade tissue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we can see that this is also a
longitudinal section and we identify the
[SPEAKER_09]: shoe apical mirecum here and if we count
up the plastocrons, here we have
[SPEAKER_09]: plastocron one, two, plastocron three and
during plastocron four, we can see this
[SPEAKER_09]: distinct swelling at the base of the
tissue, whereas the cells on the top
[SPEAKER_09]: portions of the leaf primordial are a lot
thinner in appearance.
[SPEAKER_09]: This tells me that the blade sheath
boundary is probably formed during
[SPEAKER_09]: plastocron four, it gives us more insight
on where to look at during development.
[SPEAKER_09]: A very exciting thing that happened while
I was working on this project is the
[SPEAKER_09]: recent publication of the Echinocloa
genome, which gave me the ability to use
[SPEAKER_09]: more molecular techniques to approach the
problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first thing I wanted to ask is that
whether or not known genes involved in
[SPEAKER_09]: ligular formation in say, mace species,
whether or not their expression pattern
[SPEAKER_09]: are matched with any kind of cloa species.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here I have an in situ hybridization of
the gene that I talked about, ligulus one,
[SPEAKER_09]: and here I just wanted to bring your
attention to the specificity of when and
[SPEAKER_09]: where this gene is expressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for in situ hybridization, wherever you
have this little colors lighting up,
[SPEAKER_09]: that signifies that the gene is expressed
at that particular tissue, at that
[SPEAKER_09]: particular stage in development.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to do that, what I did is I took known
protein sequences that are in mace and did
[SPEAKER_09]: some simple bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, I did a T blast end search
to try to identify orthologs in a kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: cloa that might correspond to in this
case, the ligulus one gene.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then correspondingly, I fished out
their sequences using a genome browser.
[SPEAKER_09]: So afterwards, what I can do is I can
construct a gene tree that tells me
[SPEAKER_09]: whether or not these genes are indeed true
orthologs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here I have the genes fished out from
the kind of cloa genus and then compared
[SPEAKER_09]: to ceteria, mace, rice, and as an L group,
I used a pair log that is present in mace.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we can see that they clustered
together in a clade signifying that I
[SPEAKER_09]: indeed have an ortholog of ligulus one
protein.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, we can see here that the genes
are duplicated, which isn't surprising
[SPEAKER_09]: because we know that the genus of many
kind of cloa species are actually
[SPEAKER_09]: hexaploid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the main pipeline in which I'm going to
figure out whether or not these genes are
[SPEAKER_09]: expressed is first by using these
candidate genes, I'm going to do RT-PCR to
[SPEAKER_09]: see if they are expressed in the shoot
tips.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they are expressed, then I can ask the
question on whether or not they are
[SPEAKER_09]: expressed at the correct time and at the
correct location.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by that, I'm going to use in situ
hybridizations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here are some preliminary data on what
ligulus one looks like any kind of cloa
[SPEAKER_09]: plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here I have two alleles of ligulus one
in which I term ligulus one dash one and
[SPEAKER_09]: ligulus one dash two.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can see that for dash one, we can
amplify using PCR from genomic DNA and
[SPEAKER_09]: that tells us that the gene is in fact
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you use cDNA, we can see very faint
expressions signifying that the gene is
[SPEAKER_09]: indeed expressed in a kind of cloa shoot
tips.
[SPEAKER_09]: We compare that to the allele number two,
where we get amplification in the genome,
[SPEAKER_09]: yet we do not have any expression,
which signifies that that allele is not
[SPEAKER_09]: being expressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Further on, I would like to do some in
situ hybridizations on this specific gene
[SPEAKER_09]: to see if they're expressed correctly in
the right time and the right location.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's to be determined.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one other thing that I was really
curious about is that the fact that this
[SPEAKER_09]: particular phenotype is only present in
Echinocloa genus.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that signifies that there might be
novel genetic elements that are in the
[SPEAKER_09]: Echinocloa genome.
[SPEAKER_09]: To do that, I designed an interesting
system in which I can compare what factors
[SPEAKER_09]: are in charge of making a ligule.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here I want to compare any kind of cloa
species that doesn't have a ligule and
[SPEAKER_09]: compare it to a relative that does have a
ligule signified here by these little
[SPEAKER_09]: hairy outgrowths from the top of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to do that, I'm going to utilize a
transcriptomics approach to look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: differentially expressed genes in these
two plant species and to see if there are
[SPEAKER_09]: any specific genes that are correlated
with the appearance of a ligule structure.
[SPEAKER_09]: To do this, I'm going to use an
experimental technique called laser
[SPEAKER_09]: microdissection in which I can enhance the
amount of tissue collected in very
[SPEAKER_09]: specific locations.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, I will take tissue that are
present in the blade sheath boundary.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by doing that, I'm going to cut out
specific regions of interest using the
[SPEAKER_09]: laser microdissection technique in the two
different species and isolate RNA to do an
[SPEAKER_09]: RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in summary, my main question of
interest is why we have this unique
[SPEAKER_09]: phenotype in the Echinocloa species in
which they don't have a ligule,
[SPEAKER_09]: yet have a very nice blade sheath
boundary.
[SPEAKER_09]: To do that, I have found out that the
first instances of blade sheath boundary
[SPEAKER_09]: formation are around Plasticon 4.
[SPEAKER_09]: And using very simple bioinformatics,
I was able to tell that the genes are in
[SPEAKER_09]: the genome and also expressed in the shoe
epices.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I'm not sure about its expression
in a specific manner.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by utilizing RNA-seq approaches,
I wish to identify novel gene elements
[SPEAKER_09]: that are responsible for creating a
ligule.
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, this project is funded by the
National Science Foundation and will be
[SPEAKER_09]: later on funded by the Dextral
Undergraduate Research Endowment Grant
[SPEAKER_09]: given to me, special thanks to Mike
Scanlon, who has handed down the project
[SPEAKER_09]: to me, and to Josh Strabo, who's a postdoc
in the lab that has given me a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: mentoring and support.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, thanks to other members in the
Scanlon lab and to Gerald Davis,
[SPEAKER_09]: who has provided seed to me and also gave
me a little insight on how to explore the
[SPEAKER_09]: diversity within the grass family.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, finally, to the Cornell Center
of Materials Research on assisting me on
[SPEAKER_09]: doing SEM experiments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by that, I'd like to open up to
further questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions.
[SPEAKER_23]: Very nice, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_23]: So are you hypothesizing that the lack of
ligule is related to polyploid nature and
[SPEAKER_23]: conflicts in the Kinokloa genome?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's one of the very interesting
hypotheses that I sort of came up very
[SPEAKER_09]: early on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as I was digging up in literature,
most species in the Kinokloa genus,
[SPEAKER_09]: in fact, are hexaploid or even higher
ploidy levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the highest one was 52 ploid.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's ubiquitous throughout the
genus.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that might be an indication that maybe
there are some, because the whole genome
[SPEAKER_09]: is duplicated and each gene is represented
in three times as much the quantity,
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe there's some interesting or novel
gene interaction that plays a part in the
[SPEAKER_09]: effect of creating this unique phenotype.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another really interesting observation as
I was looking at it is that for the
[SPEAKER_09]: species that do have a ligule,
they tend to be perennial in nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that too signifies something
about how this unique phenotype arises.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't found a very good way to
test that hypothesis of polyploid in terms
[SPEAKER_09]: of creating this phenotype yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's one of the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions for our poster break?
[SPEAKER_18]: The second half of our program today,
we're mixing things up a bit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Patricia Chan is going first, and then
we'll start back with Ben after Patty.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Patty will be talking today about the
LHB Conservatory The Green Jewel of
[SPEAKER_18]: Campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole class loved the title.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Patricia Chan.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is my pleasure to present to you today
about my involvement in the Liberty High
[SPEAKER_06]: Bailey Conservatory, or as Chris said,
the Green Jewel of Campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working with the conservatory in
the past few years since my matriculation
[SPEAKER_06]: in 2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to tell you a little bit about
its background and about how it's
[SPEAKER_06]: progressed over these years.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit on the history of the
conservatories on campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Liberty High Bailey Conservatory was
not our first exhibition greenhouse at
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sage Conservatory circa 1882 to 1923
is pictured above over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is around where Sage Hall is today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Liberty High Bailey himself was a renowned
botanist and horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had great involvement in the founding
of the 4-H organization and was the first
[SPEAKER_06]: dean of the College of Agriculture,
which is now known as CALS.
[SPEAKER_06]: He founded the Liberty High Bailey
Hortorium, which includes Cornell's plant
[SPEAKER_06]: anatomy collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Herbarium and our conservatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: He believed that greenhouses were vital to
the college's mission.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had visions of incorporating living
plant collections into the teaching of
[SPEAKER_06]: botany.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is pictured below the Sage Conservatory
over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first LHB conservatory was built in
1931.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a classical Lord and Burnham style
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, due to compromised structures,
it was taken down in 2010.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much to the thanks and support of the SIPS
community and CALS, the current
[SPEAKER_06]: conservatory was built recently and opened
to the public in 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's an image of the original LHB
conservatory in the Palm House.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for comparison, this is our greenhouse
today in the student house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, there are a lot of advantages of
being housed in our modern greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_06]: which allows us to use some
state-of-the-art technology to grow our
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have precise light, humidity,
and heat regulation using our Argus
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: The top photo over here, you can see the
Argus boxes, which are scattered
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout the greenhouse, which
constantly take measurements of the light
[SPEAKER_06]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the automatic system of shades,
lights, vents, fans, and fog will adjust
[SPEAKER_06]: these in real time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have numerous irrigation options,
including reverse osmosis water,
[SPEAKER_06]: tempered water, and fertilized water to
cater to the needs of our diverse
[SPEAKER_06]: collection, as well as four feet deep of a
custom growing medium in our Palm House
[SPEAKER_06]: for our large trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these factors together allows us to
grow plants for many different climates,
[SPEAKER_06]: including those originating from desert
temperate regions, peat fogs, or aquatic
[SPEAKER_06]: areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, why do we have the conservatory for
the first place?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it serves our uses as a living
museum.
[SPEAKER_06]: For one, it's an attraction for artists
and photographers from all around to come
[SPEAKER_06]: here for inspiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an oasis for students and faculty
here during Ithaca's long and arduous
[SPEAKER_06]: winters, especially this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the home of the titan arums,
which I'm sure you've heard of,
[SPEAKER_06]: Wysinkii and Corollus, which I'll talk a
little bit about later.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we play a role in preserving rare and
unusual species by sharing seeds cuttings
[SPEAKER_06]: and propagules with other academic
institutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, most importantly to us, the
conservatory is a versatile educational
[SPEAKER_06]: tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Material from the conservatory is used to
teach classes, and many groups of students
[SPEAKER_06]: and others come through and tour
regularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The material from this greenhouse is used
to teach classes such as plant
[SPEAKER_06]: biodiversity, systematics, paleobotany,
chemical ecology, and even classes like
[SPEAKER_06]: botanical illustration.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a quick aside to that point,
here's some examples of artworks done by
[SPEAKER_06]: myself and my fellow students in our
botanical illustration classes from
[SPEAKER_06]: subjects that we saw in the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, during this talk, I'll be chatting a
little bit about our recent projects in
[SPEAKER_06]: continuing to showcase our biodiversity,
fortifying our collections database,
[SPEAKER_06]: and installing an in-ground pond.
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, biodiversity, as we can't have
a greenhouse without plants inside of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This picture was taken in 2015 during the
reestablishment of the conservatory in our
[SPEAKER_06]: new greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got Melissa Lynn Breckner and
Chad Thomas, who are greenhouse workers at
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornell, transporting these comically
large cycads in through this much smaller
[SPEAKER_06]: door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our conservatory boasts great
biodiversity, and we're always trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: improve on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, we have about 150 families,
and in our database, we have over 750
[SPEAKER_06]: unique specimens accessions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the most well-represented families
that we have are crassulaceae,
[SPEAKER_06]: known as the succulents, orchidaceae,
orchids, cactaceae, cacti, and araceae,
[SPEAKER_06]: arums.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit more about this photo in the
corner here is this photo is
[SPEAKER_06]: Amorphophallus omsaculeae, which is the
smallest member of the genus
[SPEAKER_06]: Amorphophallus.
[SPEAKER_06]: For reference in the background here is
the petiole of its cousin, the largest
[SPEAKER_06]: member of Amorphophallus, Amorphophallus
titanum.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the titan arums.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is just the petiole of one single
leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got Wee Stinky and Corollus,
which are two adult blooming-sized titan
[SPEAKER_06]: arums, and people travel from all over the
country in order to witness these plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: which over the course of several days
produces stunningly large inflorescence
[SPEAKER_06]: with a scent akin to rotting meat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the years, students and faculty have
taken seed and data describing volatile
[SPEAKER_06]: emissions of these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the background, Wee Stinky here,
you may be able to discern the vegetative
[SPEAKER_06]: state of Corollus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's Corollus in bloom, who is
actually our first titan to have blooming
[SPEAKER_06]: outside in men's gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might also be able to see this fishing
line descending down into the space as we
[SPEAKER_06]: place a sticky insect trap in order to
check for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Samantha Schultz and I.
[SPEAKER_06]: Samantha's in the audience here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have our database, which serves to
inform the general public as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: people of the curatorial and horticultural
staff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Accessible to the public, we have
information like the taxonomy of the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, including Latin name, family,
common name, geography of where plants are
[SPEAKER_06]: native to, and additional historical and
ethnobotanical information.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a myriad of photos of these
plants in different stages and
[SPEAKER_06]: supplemental info in the form of videos or
links to additional websites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Accessible to the curators and to the
horticultural staff, we have information
[SPEAKER_06]: like the present location of the plant and
flowering times.
[SPEAKER_06]: In collecting flowering times,
we're starting to reveal trends that can
[SPEAKER_06]: help professors coordinate their lesson
plans with the blooms in the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over here, we have an example of one of
the pages that would be brought up if you
[SPEAKER_06]: scanned one of the QR codes in the
conservatory to bring more information
[SPEAKER_06]: about this aristolochia.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is alumnus Nick Linus and I taking
down data in order to input in the
[SPEAKER_06]: database.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you see over here and here are
examples of QR codes posted on the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: where you can scan them with your mobile
device to bring up information in the
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have several efforts in order to
best showcase our collections to the
[SPEAKER_06]: public to disperse information and make
everything more accessible.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, for one, organized our plants
into collection series of educational
[SPEAKER_06]: themes such as convergence or the separate
evolution of similar traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, succulents, carnivory,
or curdisiforms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have an evolutionary sequence that
goes from bryophytes through terrifites,
[SPEAKER_06]: gymnosperms, and angiosperms that goes to
the center aisle of the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned before, we have QR codes on
about 119 plants in the conservatory where
[SPEAKER_06]: you can access information with your
phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Craig Kramer runs the conservatory
blog which features plants and current
[SPEAKER_06]: events for everyone to find online.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, I'll be talking a little bit about
the ponds in the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a project that I was involved in
in the summer of 2016 where I worked
[SPEAKER_06]: really closely with Kevin Nixon and Paul
Cooper and other greenhouse staff in order
[SPEAKER_06]: to install this in order for us to have a
venue to display our aquatic plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit about this pond.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's approximately eight feet long and
three feet deep at its deepest point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got like a wooden shelving
infrastructure in order to display plants
[SPEAKER_06]: of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs fertilized water which is recycled
via the waterfall that's located in the
[SPEAKER_06]: corner over here and it's lined with
coconut coir which can be used as a
[SPEAKER_06]: substrate for semi-aquatic plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The perimeter is kept usually very moist
so it's very suitable for moisture-loving
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, this pond allows us to
grow plants such as our carnivorous
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, our tropical and temperate pitcher
plants, our Saracenia and Nepenthes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have aquatic plants like Marsilia and
Azolla, bryophytes such as moss and
[SPEAKER_06]: liverworts, and our Victoria waterlily
pictured over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got this stunning blossom that goes
over the course of two days with the
[SPEAKER_06]: beetle pollinated strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over here is me handling the Victoria
waterlily.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see, the pads grow up to three
feet in diameter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ongoing projects in the conservatory
include installing a central trunk in the
[SPEAKER_06]: pond house, working on getting a fake tree
using a Robinia bark in order to host
[SPEAKER_06]: epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_06]: An in-ground succulent and cacti garden
and of course the continued expansion of
[SPEAKER_06]: plant collections and database information
to increase accessibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to acknowledge Kevin Nixon,
my advisor and the curator of the Liberty
[SPEAKER_06]: High Bailey Conservatory, Paul Cooper and
the other greenhouse staff for keeping
[SPEAKER_06]: these plants alive and raising them so
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Craig Kramer who fastidiously documented
this via his photography and Ed Cobb who
[SPEAKER_06]: elucidated information on the previous
greenhouses on campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly I'd like to thank you all for being
here today and if this presentation piqued
[SPEAKER_06]: your interest consider visiting the
conservatory which is open on weekdays
[SPEAKER_06]: from 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: to 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'd like to open the floor to
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions from the floor.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Patty what new species would you like
to see added?
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were like the curator and you
wanted to ask it, what's your dream plants
[SPEAKER_12]: that you would like to have?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a really great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many that I can't even begin to
think of just a few names but I would
[SPEAKER_06]: really like to see a lot more families
being represented, even more orders.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some really interesting plants
that I don't think are advertised very
[SPEAKER_06]: well such as our Amborellas which play a
really interesting role in the placement
[SPEAKER_06]: of basal angiosperms and I'd like to see
more plants that are not necessarily large
[SPEAKER_06]: and showy but play maybe a historical
importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Patty.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Ben Sword.
[SPEAKER_18]: Ben in addition to being a plant sciences
major is the chief botanist and clinical
[SPEAKER_18]: officer at Ecosystems and today he'll be
talking about charge zeolite as a
[SPEAKER_18]: hydroponic growth medium.
[SPEAKER_18]: Ben.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you Chris.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as Chris mentioned I'm a plant science
major concentrating in breeding and
[SPEAKER_11]: genetics but most of my research and
extracurricular interest is in hydroponics
[SPEAKER_11]: and so I've been working closely with Neil
Mattson on a lot of the research here and
[SPEAKER_11]: so today I'll be talking about zeolite as
an alternative hydroponic growth media.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the current problem with hydroponics is
that rockwool is mainly used for starting
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds and transplanting into along the
growth of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem with rockwool is that it
starts with its inception and how it's
[SPEAKER_11]: made.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was originally used as insulation
material and basically what rockwool is is
[SPEAKER_11]: rock that's been melted down and then spun
like cotton candy in order to make this
[SPEAKER_11]: insulation fiber material.
[SPEAKER_11]: And another issue with it is that it's
non-biodegradable and non-reusable so that
[SPEAKER_11]: when the growers are done with their one
round of cycle with these plants they have
[SPEAKER_11]: to throw out the rockwool and start with
new ones and that just sits in a landfill
[SPEAKER_11]: and doesn't will never biodegrade.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last issue with rockwool is that
it has a very low cation exchange capacity
[SPEAKER_11]: making it very inert and cation exchange
capacity is the materials ability to hold
[SPEAKER_11]: on to fertilizer and other ions that the
plant needs throughout its growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the alternative that I found for
rockwool is called zeolite.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a rock that has a honeycomb like
structure which allows it to have a high
[SPEAKER_11]: cation exchange capacity making it able to
hold on to those ions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the structure of it is this beta cage
which creates the actual structure of the
[SPEAKER_11]: rock and then the alpha cage which is
inside where the ions are stored.
[SPEAKER_11]: So along with this high CEC it provides
structural support for the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a water and air holding capacity
which is similar to potting mix and it is
[SPEAKER_11]: able to buffer the pH of the solution
because of that CEC.
[SPEAKER_11]: The way that I found this media was
through NASA research that NASA did with a
[SPEAKER_11]: few different types of zeolite and in
their synthetic substrate they used these
[SPEAKER_11]: three medias here which are designed it
was designed in a specific way so that the
[SPEAKER_11]: nutrients in those three types of zeolite
were slowly released over the course of
[SPEAKER_11]: the growth cycle of the plant and then
able to have effective yields.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was one of their trials that they
did and with carrots and this these are
[SPEAKER_11]: over generations of reusing the media
taking out the old organic matter
[SPEAKER_11]: sterilizing it and then reusing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so as you can see the first round of
carrots was pretty normal but then as they
[SPEAKER_11]: started continually growing in the zeolite
you can see the carrots started to form
[SPEAKER_11]: fingers I guess and they kind of split
into different different roots which is
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the current uses in industry for
zeolite include hard water treatment in
[SPEAKER_11]: facilities where they take out all the
salts and other things that are in the in
[SPEAKER_11]: the water.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's used as a soil additive mainly in in
golf courses and that's the zeopro on the
[SPEAKER_11]: left here.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the use of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried growing in that but it was mainly
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no nitrogen or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a water runoff analysis and so that
didn't really work.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's also used as an odor eliminator
in horse stalls and cat litter.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last thing which is pretty
skeptical is a detox which I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: recommend to anybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the commercial application which I am
trying to use this for is my startup
[SPEAKER_11]: company called Ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're making kitchen top growth chambers
for the consumer to grow their own
[SPEAKER_11]: culinary herbs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can think about it kind of like a
curing machine for plants where you put
[SPEAKER_11]: the pod into the system fill up with water
and then it does everything else for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It creates a controlled environment for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the app reminds you when you need to
do anything to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my efforts with zeolite are trying to
develop this growth pod.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the first experiment that I did was
a germination experiment.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was five treatments and three
replicates of each treatment just to see
[SPEAKER_11]: if it would just to see if it could
effectively germinate these cilantro
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the treatments, the first one,
the control was with a tap water soak and
[SPEAKER_11]: then a CEA fertilizer recipe 1X strength
soak going all the way down to 8X and then
[SPEAKER_11]: a addition of magnesium on the T3.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the CEA recipe is basically just a two
part nutrient solution with 125 parts per
[SPEAKER_11]: million nitrogen target.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the results from this experiment are
that I had high germination across the
[SPEAKER_11]: board besides the tap water treatment,
which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the zeolite was able to hold onto
the nutrients for the seedling stage,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the design of this experiment was such
that there was no tray or anything that
[SPEAKER_11]: would catch the runoff water underneath
these pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after the seedling stage, the growth
kind of stopped.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is due to leaching from
just the clear water irrigation that we
[SPEAKER_11]: were giving the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the highest fresh weights and root
weights were observed in both T5,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is the CEA 8X soak and the CEA
recipe plus magnesium.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see the magnesium one over here
and the 8X right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have very substantial root zones
as compared to these other three.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the next experiment that I did was
trying to create this sort of pod.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the experiment here is to replicate
the different methods that we might use in
[SPEAKER_11]: our system, in our product to kind of,
to provide this service to our customers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first treatment here is just a,
it's kind of like a control with the
[SPEAKER_11]: Rockwell cubes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm growing lettuce in this experiment
as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's five trays with four plants in
each tray.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this replicate or this treatment was
being top fertilized with the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_11]: fertilizer that just comes out of the tap.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so those nutrients were allowed to
kind of accumulate in the tray.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this would simulate if we were to have
the consumer add in nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_11]: reservoir instead of having the nutrients
in the pod.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then these two treatments were with
charged zeolite.
[SPEAKER_11]: So zeolite soaked in CEA 2X and zeolite
charged in CEA 4X.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is what it looked like when I
first started.
[SPEAKER_11]: I took lettuce seedlings and took away the
Rockwell on, for the majority of the
[SPEAKER_11]: Rockwell and left the roots intact.
[SPEAKER_11]: Transplanting them into the zeolite here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I just put the entire Rockwell
cube in the pot on these trials.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the results for this, I took
yesterday and so it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the highest yield comes from the
zeolite 4X.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's one of the main, one of our main
options moving forward, getting closer to
[SPEAKER_11]: product launch.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this isn't necessarily an
experiment, but this is just some
[SPEAKER_11]: anecdotal growing that I did with the
hydroponics club.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we grew three carrots in a Dutch
bucket system, purple carrots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And next to it we have beets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there's no control or anything
here, but it's just kind of a fun little
[SPEAKER_11]: grow experiment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody remembers this slide from
the NASA when they tried growing carrots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is what I got, which is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, they had the same kind of fingers
that the NASA carrots did, but a similar
[SPEAKER_11]: height and fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the prototype right now that
we currently have for our unit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like to call them zeopods.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's basically charged zeolite in the
base with a little bit of rock wall on top
[SPEAKER_11]: for the seedling germination and then
enclosed in the unit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything so far has been working
pretty good in my house.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Preliminary conclusions from this are that
zeolite has a water and air holding
[SPEAKER_11]: capacity that's comparable to potting mix.
[SPEAKER_11]: The CEA is adequate to hold nutrients for
at least the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_11]: Zeolite, zeopods, the 4X soap was pretty
good across the board.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the zeolite is easily sieved,
washed and autoclaved and able to be used
[SPEAKER_11]: again, unlike rock wall, which is one of
the main reasons why I set out studying
[SPEAKER_11]: zeolite.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in root crops, it causes them to
almost bifurcate the root and cause these
[SPEAKER_11]: formation of fingers on the roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And further experimentation I'd like to do
over this summer includes soaking the
[SPEAKER_11]: zeolite in sensigrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the issues that I had in those
trays was that the pH tends to shoot up
[SPEAKER_11]: really high over the growth cycles of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we want it to be able to have the
consumer not have to do anything to adjust
[SPEAKER_11]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've already tested this fertilizer in
my food computer that I built,
[SPEAKER_11]: and it does its job.
[SPEAKER_11]: It regulates the pH, keeps it at 5.8,
which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so hopefully if I soak zeolite in that
and keep them in the trays, it'll do the
[SPEAKER_11]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'd like to do more root crop
trials and more zeopod trials with
[SPEAKER_11]: different combinations.
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that, I'd just like to thank Dr.
Neil Mattson for being my advisor on all
[SPEAKER_11]: my research, John Sanat in the Jump Start
program for funding everything,
[SPEAKER_11]: the Hydroponics Club for being my pride
and joy, KPL Greenhouse staff for,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially Julie, for everything that
she's done in the greenhouses for me,
[SPEAKER_11]: and my team at Ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take some questions if there are any.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are the fingers that grow on root crops,
are those desirable?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the point of them?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think they're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in a supermarket, I doubt that they
would sell very well because everyone
[SPEAKER_11]: would be like, wow, those are GMO carrots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody wants to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but Chris thought that it might be
the fact that when the root apical
[SPEAKER_11]: meristem encounters something in its path,
it tends to split.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I'd like to see if that happens
with other crops that are root.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they just, for some reason,
didn't see that result on that first.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why that happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they saw it in all the other trials.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if you grind it finer, does it still
have the same effect of dissecting the
[SPEAKER_16]: root tips?
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you try that?
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't tried that yet, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would expect it to grow more similar
to soil.
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, Brad.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Kelly Damon.
[SPEAKER_18]: And she will be talking about the hunger
games of cabbage, varietal susceptibility
[SPEAKER_18]: to black rot.
[SPEAKER_18]: Kelly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, look out.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what I just did.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, we're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as Chris said, my name is Kelly Damon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today I'll be presenting on cabbage
varietal susceptibility to black rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did this research in Dr. Christine
Smart's lab over the past summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of background about the
project of this goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was essentially to identify the
different levels of susceptibility to
[SPEAKER_08]: black rot and commercially available
cabbage varieties that cabbage farmers
[SPEAKER_08]: would use in their own fields.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of background about the
host, the disease, and also the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the host that we were running this
experiment with was cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a cruciferous vegetable,
which is part of the brassicae family.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have pictures in case somebody
doesn't know what a cabbage looks like.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the cabbage heads up here,
and just showing you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_08]: differentiation between it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also in the middle, just a little
bit of the cabbage growth itself,
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So New York is actually one of the top
producers in the United States of cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: They produce fresh as well as processed
cabbage, including sauerkraut.
[SPEAKER_08]: And its estimated value of production is
$48.6 million, and that's according to a
[SPEAKER_08]: 2017 census report done by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of background about the
disease that I'm talking about today,
[SPEAKER_08]: black rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Black rot was first identified in New York
in 1896, and essentially since then has
[SPEAKER_08]: been a common issue for cabbage growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This disease does cause a lot of economic
growth, or excuse me, economic loss to
[SPEAKER_08]: growers, as it produces undesirable heads
of cabbage that the farmers can't bring to
[SPEAKER_08]: the market to sell, and it also decreases
the yields that the farmers see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Black rot is transmitted multiple ways,
first being through seeds or transplants
[SPEAKER_08]: that are already infected with this
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as crop debris that were left over
in the field and weeds surrounding the
[SPEAKER_08]: field, but its main source to infect a
crop is through water droplets.
[SPEAKER_08]: So such as rain or other splashes and
forms of water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the pathogen that causes black rot
disease is known as Xanthomonas
[SPEAKER_08]: compestris, pathobar compestris,
and I'll be referring to this as XCC
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout the remainder of this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see here on the left side of
the screen, the screen that it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: gram-negative bacterium, and this is just
what I played it out to kind of show you
[SPEAKER_08]: some of its characteristics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then over here on the right side of
the screen, you could see it's very
[SPEAKER_08]: characteristic yellow V-shaped lesions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how does this pathogen essentially get
into the plant to cause this infection?
[SPEAKER_08]: So XCC generally enters through the
hydathodes of a plant, and the hydathode
[SPEAKER_08]: is essentially just modified pore along
the line of the leaf margin of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And from the hydathode, a mutation fluid,
which is essentially just water buildup
[SPEAKER_08]: right here, is an easy source to get
contaminated by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the bacteria essentially will move in
to this little droplet of water,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can see how easy it is for it to
start essentially affecting the plant and
[SPEAKER_08]: getting into the vascular system of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the hydathode is not the only
entry point for XCC, as it can also come
[SPEAKER_08]: into the plant through different types of
wounding, such as herbivory, so insect
[SPEAKER_08]: damage, also hail, along with different
mechanical damage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once XCC is present in the plant
itself, it can actually survive in the
[SPEAKER_08]: xylem for many, many months until
favorable conditions arise.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is essentially what causes the large
problem, the issues for the growers,
[SPEAKER_08]: because they don't know if their plants
have lacrosse or not, until you get
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions which are warm and also wet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once those conditions arise,
the bacteria can multiply very rapidly and
[SPEAKER_08]: then go systemically throughout the plant,
essentially getting into the cabbage head
[SPEAKER_08]: itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this image here is just to show you
another form of damage.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is hail damage, and you can see the
discoloration in the leaf, along with how
[SPEAKER_08]: the veins are starting to blacken just a
little bit and starting to move through
[SPEAKER_08]: the vascular system of this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So currently there's a couple control
methods that are available to growers,
[SPEAKER_08]: but most of them are preventative,
as well as good management practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for starters, you have just good
sanitation practices with tools and
[SPEAKER_08]: equipment, along with just making sure
that the greenhouse that they're being
[SPEAKER_08]: grown in is sanitized.
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with this, you can also do crop
rotation to help suppress the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can have pathogen-free seeds and
transplants, which is always a good way to
[SPEAKER_08]: start.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can control the weeds that are
surrounding the field, especially those
[SPEAKER_08]: that are possibly close relatives in this
sense to the cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also has been shown that some
copper sprays have been helpful in
[SPEAKER_08]: reducing the spread of black rot as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the research I did, we started this
on May 5th, and we sowed 35 different
[SPEAKER_08]: cabbage cultivar varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did this based on different
harvesting points.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had 10 early season cultivars,
14 mid-season, and 11 late-season
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivars that we planted.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on May 31st, after they grew a
little bit, we moved them out to the cold
[SPEAKER_08]: frames, which essentially is just a box
with an open lid, so those plants can
[SPEAKER_08]: begin to get a little hardy.
[SPEAKER_08]: before they are transplanted into the
field itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then on June 12th, we started to plant
the cabbage plants by hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was roughly about 700 cabbage plants
that we had to plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I fortunately had the help of the smart
lab to help me with planning those.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did a randomized leap block design
for this planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And each cultivar was planted in five
plant plots with four repetitions each.
[SPEAKER_08]: So after they had some time to kind of
settle in, get used to the environment,
[SPEAKER_08]: and get established, we then went out in
the early morning of June 27th to spray
[SPEAKER_08]: inoculate with backpack sprayers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did this in the early morning
essentially because this is when that
[SPEAKER_08]: mutation fluid is most present,
as well as this is when the cabbage plants
[SPEAKER_08]: are transpiring the most.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully it increases our chance for
infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we used was a New York strain of
XCC that was isolated from cabbage in
[SPEAKER_08]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from there, about a week and a half
later, we waited to see if infections
[SPEAKER_08]: would occur.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we started ratings of percent
incidence, as well as severity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did that once a week for four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after we did those ratings,
we then waited until the first harvest,
[SPEAKER_08]: so the early harvest of the first 10
cultivars, and then moved on to the 14
[SPEAKER_08]: mid-season cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the 11 late-season cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we harvested, we harvested two
heads per plot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a total of eight heads per
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how we rated these was on a visual
basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just to kind of show you a
comparison between a susceptible and a
[SPEAKER_08]: tolerant cultivar of cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here on your left, you have the
cultivar persuma.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a slightly more susceptible
variety, excuse me, cultivar to black rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see the characteristic
V-shaped lesions on the older leaves,
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as on the younger leaves,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then over here on the right,
you have a more tolerant cultivar species.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a capture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see some of the V-shaped
lesions on the older leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, when you look at the younger
leaves, there aren't as many present,
[SPEAKER_08]: if none at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And taking those pictures onto this graph
here, this is just showing the amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: disease over time, depending on the
particular cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I was just showing you
previously, you could see Corsuma here all
[SPEAKER_08]: the way on the left is under the extremely
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could see the progression of
disease throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, when you compare that to the
capture that I was just talking about,
[SPEAKER_08]: you could see that the amount of disease
over the growing period was a lot lower,
[SPEAKER_08]: in essence, to the Corsuma cultivar.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we did these visual ratings,
we started with looking at the core of the
[SPEAKER_08]: cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would harvest, basically just cut
off the cabbage head, flip it over to look
[SPEAKER_08]: at the core.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we're looking for, this is kind
of the best picture of it, is kind of that
[SPEAKER_08]: blackening, the black lesions of the veins
going into the cabbage head.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we saw that, there was a good
indication that there might be black rot
[SPEAKER_08]: inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: So after we did that, and all of the heads
that we harvested, which had black rot,
[SPEAKER_08]: we would then split them in half and look
to see how much infection was actually in
[SPEAKER_08]: the head of cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see on this picture on your
left, the black rot moving into the
[SPEAKER_08]: cabbage, and then how it spreads
throughout the cabbage head into the
[SPEAKER_08]: center of the cabbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is essentially what is making the
cabbage unmarketable for growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are just a couple of other
images to show you kind of the array,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you will, of disease between the
cabbage heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once we harvested all three harvest
seasons, we then kind of looked at the
[SPEAKER_08]: total comparison of percent of infection
of the cultivars throughout those harvest
[SPEAKER_08]: times.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could see that the early season,
which was harvested in mid to late July,
[SPEAKER_08]: had the least amount of infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cabbage heads, which we were
looking at.
[SPEAKER_08]: And any of the cultivars that don't have a
green bar, that just indicates that when
[SPEAKER_08]: we harvested them, there was a 0%
infection in those heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you progress throughout the season,
the mid season and late season cultivars
[SPEAKER_08]: generally had a higher amount of
infection, especially in the late season.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I will note that there are a
couple cultivars in the late season,
[SPEAKER_08]: which still had 0% infection or very
minimal percent infection of black rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in summary, with the research that I
did, we have done this previous growing
[SPEAKER_08]: seasons, especially the year before,
which was completely different weather
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it was interesting to see that
even with the different weather
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions, the cultivar susceptibility
basically remained the same throughout
[SPEAKER_08]: those two growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, as I mentioned earlier, with the
comparison of, for assume, and capture,
[SPEAKER_08]: that some of the cultivars had infection
in the early stages.
[SPEAKER_08]: But once the newer leaves rose,
you didn't see as much infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the third point is that the
cultivars showing internal symptoms were
[SPEAKER_08]: generally associated with the most polar
black rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, in regards to the last slide we
looked at the last graph, the mid and late
[SPEAKER_08]: season cultivars showed more internal
symptoms of black rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is essentially probably because
they were in the field longer,
[SPEAKER_08]: so they had a greater chance of being
infected and more seriously infected.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on that note, I'd like to acknowledge
Dr. Christine Smart for letting me help
[SPEAKER_08]: out in the lab and run this experiment,
as well as Holly Lang, who was my
[SPEAKER_08]: supervisor during this time, and also the
entire 2017 smart lab, the grad students
[SPEAKER_08]: and the summer scholars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the cabbage research and
development program, which if it wasn't
[SPEAKER_08]: for them, we wouldn't be able to do this
research.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, and I'm happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there wild resistant relatives,
sister groups of commercial cabbage from
[SPEAKER_16]: which resistance genes could be harvested
or bred in?
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the deal there?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not 100% sure, so I can't fully
answer that question.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would assume that there probably are
some resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which potentially future research can be
done in that and seeing if somehow we can
[SPEAKER_08]: inherit a breeding system possibly to get
these cultivars to be more tolerant of
[SPEAKER_08]: black rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm curious about the mechanism in
which the inoculation occurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So since you have the hydrothodes that are
secreting water outside, I'm supposing
[SPEAKER_09]: that collects bacteria does it like suck
it back in or something?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or does it just sort of randomly by chance
go into the veins?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just start swimming.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in essence, that's why we did it in the
early morning because the fluid is so
[SPEAKER_08]: prevalent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it does increase our chances for
infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And generally, the mutation of fluid is
due to the pressure basically in the root
[SPEAKER_08]: system and the plant itself can't handle
that amount of water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's trying to shoot it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once that I would assume once it
balances out with the root and everything
[SPEAKER_08]: that it would essentially decrease the
mutation fluid, which in essence could
[SPEAKER_08]: suck bacteria back and kind of help it get
into the system a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Kelly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Patrick O'Brien.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he will be talking about a push-pull
agro ecosystem, sustainably manipulating
[SPEAKER_18]: tritrophic interactions.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm going to be talking to you today
about biological control of a invasive
[SPEAKER_26]: pest species in Africa.
[SPEAKER_26]: To start though, I'm going to zoom way out
to a bigger issue of food security.
[SPEAKER_26]: And there's four points to food security
that matter in this case.
[SPEAKER_26]: Availability is being able to access your
food at any time that you need to.
[SPEAKER_26]: Access itself is related to being able to
have the food in a location that you can
[SPEAKER_26]: reach.
[SPEAKER_26]: Say we run into this issue in urban areas
in the US where the problem becomes the
[SPEAKER_26]: only available source is if there's a
liquor store in the area but not any
[SPEAKER_26]: grocery stores or things like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: Additionally, we want nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I mean the food needs to be supportive
of a healthy lifestyle for yourself and
[SPEAKER_26]: culturally appropriate.
[SPEAKER_26]: That means we can't just come in and
dictate what people grow for themselves.
[SPEAKER_26]: To lead a healthy and happy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_26]: So zooming in on Kenya itself,
food security wise, it's 33% of
[SPEAKER_26]: sub-Saharan African countries are food
insecure.
[SPEAKER_26]: So anything below the desert are running
into a substantial problem with providing
[SPEAKER_26]: themselves with healthy and appropriate
food.
[SPEAKER_26]: In Kenya itself, 80% of the population
either lives off of the food that they
[SPEAKER_26]: grow themselves or they live off of
selling the agricultural products that
[SPEAKER_26]: they make.
[SPEAKER_26]: And within Kenya itself, 10 million plus
people are food insecure.
[SPEAKER_26]: You can see the more heavily affected
areas here and a little less so here.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll be working with Poveda Lab down here
on this offshoot of Lake Victoria where
[SPEAKER_26]: it's a little less affected by food
security issues.
[SPEAKER_26]: But this is the note that this is previous
to the introduction of the pest species
[SPEAKER_26]: that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_26]: This pest species is Spadoptera fugiperda
or fall armyworm.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's native to this region of the US.
[SPEAKER_26]: It was introduced in 2016.
[SPEAKER_26]: They found it in Nigeria and Saotome and
Principe.
[SPEAKER_26]: And since that time, it is now from this
line south.
[SPEAKER_26]: It is in every country in Africa.
[SPEAKER_26]: Africa just happens to have a very
conducive climate to this insect on
[SPEAKER_26]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_26]: And spreading.
[SPEAKER_26]: So here in America, we control it via BT
crops and by insecticides.
[SPEAKER_26]: For the folks that we're going to be
working directly with, it's mostly about
[SPEAKER_26]: subsistence farmers.
[SPEAKER_26]: So on a general basis, they can't afford
the insecticides to be used to control
[SPEAKER_26]: this insect.
[SPEAKER_26]: BT is a non-issue because Kenya doesn't
allow GMO crops.
[SPEAKER_26]: So the difference between a common pest
that Kenya is affected by African armyworm
[SPEAKER_26]: and the fall armyworm is that when the
African armyworm, it targets their grain
[SPEAKER_26]: crops.
[SPEAKER_26]: When it has fed to the point of being
satisfied, it moves on to another
[SPEAKER_26]: agricultural plot.
[SPEAKER_26]: The fall armyworm instead switches to
different host plants and completely
[SPEAKER_26]: devastates these subsistence farmers'
crops.
[SPEAKER_26]: And with that, their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_26]: So Aveda Lab is working with Isipe,
the International Center for Insect
[SPEAKER_26]: Physiology and Ecology.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're working on a push-pull system,
agro-ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_26]: That is a type of intercropping that works
well on the tri-propagic interactions.
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the effects of the host plant and
the insect pests and their natural
[SPEAKER_26]: enemies.
[SPEAKER_26]: What we're looking at is intercropping the
corn with a desmodium species.
[SPEAKER_26]: It is a sebaceous plant that brings in,
it adds nitrogen to the system for the
[SPEAKER_26]: maize plants.
[SPEAKER_26]: Initially, desmodium was used,
you can see it here, desmodium was used to
[SPEAKER_26]: control striaga, invasive weed,
parasitic weed.
[SPEAKER_26]: And they found that it also releases some
volatile chemicals that the insect pests
[SPEAKER_26]: are repelled by.
[SPEAKER_26]: So the desmodium helps to push the insects
away from the maize plants and napier
[SPEAKER_26]: grass releases volatiles that are an
attractant to the insect pests.
[SPEAKER_26]: So in conjunction, the two species
intercropped with corn help push the
[SPEAKER_26]: insect pests out to the napier grass.
[SPEAKER_26]: Napier grass also acts as a water crop for
their animal livestock.
[SPEAKER_26]: So they have that benefit as well.
[SPEAKER_26]: So what we're specifically looking at is
how the interaction between the two help
[SPEAKER_26]: to, the increased diversity helps bring in
parasitoid wasps that target the insect
[SPEAKER_26]: pest species.
[SPEAKER_26]: So the wasps in question is Chilonis.
[SPEAKER_26]: What we saw a year ago was that even with
how newly introduced the pest species is
[SPEAKER_26]: to the area, we found this species of wasp
that typically targets Spodoptera in
[SPEAKER_26]: general.
[SPEAKER_26]: It has switched to a new to target these
introduced species.
[SPEAKER_26]: What it does is it comes in and it finds
the clutches of eggs.
[SPEAKER_26]: It lays eggs within the eggs and the
parasitoid babies stay within the eggs and
[SPEAKER_26]: into this state, into the larval stage
where they burst forth similar to the
[SPEAKER_26]: movie Alien to go forward and terrorize
future Spodoptera.
[SPEAKER_26]: So our experiment is going to be,
we're going to lay sentinel clutches of
[SPEAKER_26]: eggs on within the push pole system plots.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're going to give it a set amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to come back before they
become larva and collect the eggs to
[SPEAKER_26]: account both the parasitoid rate,
parasitize the parasitism rate and to
[SPEAKER_26]: account how many have been predated on by
other species.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're going to collect that
information.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to go to, we're going to be
stationed here where Isipe campus is,
[SPEAKER_26]: and we'll be in this rural region here
working with both farmers that have
[SPEAKER_26]: accepted our help here.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're going to have roughly 10 farms.
[SPEAKER_26]: They're going to be separated by at least
two miles from each other.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're going to be controlling for the
push pole system and conventional systems
[SPEAKER_26]: of agriculture for subsistence farmers.
[SPEAKER_26]: On collection day, we're going to
hopefully beat this instance so we don't
[SPEAKER_26]: spread more Spodoptera into the region.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to be looking for basically
how much damage has happened to the
[SPEAKER_26]: plants.
[SPEAKER_26]: Reporting, that's Dr. Andre Kressler.
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's Ethan from the Kessler lab.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're going to be looking at the
parasitism rate.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're also going to be running transects
within the field itself with bug nets to
[SPEAKER_26]: catch additional species richness and
abundance.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're also going to do pitfall traps
to see if there's any correlation between
[SPEAKER_26]: the predation rate of the eggs and maybe
some species that we haven't looked at
[SPEAKER_26]: previously.
[SPEAKER_26]: So the outcomes we hope to have from this
is to intensify our network with Isipe
[SPEAKER_26]: working with the farmers themselves and
establish a better network with that.
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a very preliminary work so far.
[SPEAKER_26]: And working with the extension workers to
get this information out to the farmers
[SPEAKER_26]: themselves so that we can start working on
controlling this pest.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're hoping to find some correlation
with the parasitism rate and the push pole
[SPEAKER_26]: system and hopefully get a damage
reduction for the plants and see a little
[SPEAKER_26]: more production for the farmers
themselves.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd like to thank the Cow's Global
Fellows.
[SPEAKER_26]: They're funding me getting out there.
[SPEAKER_26]: Poveda Lab, my mentor, Katia Poveda,
my NPI and the graduate student who's kind
[SPEAKER_26]: of figure headed this project,
Tim Ludemarser.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we'll be working closely with Kessler
lab as well.
[SPEAKER_26]: Dr. Andre Kessler and from the Isipe
campus, Dr. Khan and Dr. Mendega.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_26]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does Moira push the armyworm onto the
maze?
[SPEAKER_15]: Start that over.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does Moira push the armyworm onto the
maze?
No.
[SPEAKER_26]: It works to push the armyworm away from
the insect pests in general.
[SPEAKER_26]: The volatiles are repellent away from the
system itself.
[SPEAKER_26]: Together with the trap crop, the pull of
the napier grass,
[SPEAKER_26]: individually they worked fairly well,
but together they worked exceptionally
[SPEAKER_26]: well at pulling the pest species away from
your crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you said that the caterpillars are
able to move from one plant toast to
[SPEAKER_10]: another, but how do they do that if
they're little caterpillars?
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, the caterpillars themselves stay
within the area.
[SPEAKER_26]: The moth sage is highly mobile.
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's been spreading that way and they
just have a very rapid generation time now
[SPEAKER_26]: that they're in a conducive climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Patrick.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Katie Mazur and she
will be talking today about crop load and
[SPEAKER_18]: harvest management for hard cider
orchards.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today I'm going to be talking about my
involvement in this while I was a fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: intern at the Cornell orchard last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Working with Dr. Greg Peck, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit of history about hard
cider.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard cider is actually very culturally
important to American history.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons being is that fruit
trees were shown that you had a long-term
[SPEAKER_05]: stake in the land.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as people were moving west and settling
in the frontier, having those fruit trees
[SPEAKER_05]: indicated that they were actually meant
there to stay and actually had a stake in
[SPEAKER_05]: the land.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the more popular fruit trees
was apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from that, hard cider usually was
produced by many homeowners and farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the more easier things for
them to make, especially compared to say
[SPEAKER_05]: grapes since they were difficult to grow
over things like phylloxera.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you jump closer, jump forward
to the beginning of the 20th century,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's about three different things that
kind of put the nail in the coffin for
[SPEAKER_05]: cider production.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was a large immigration of
northern and central European immigrants
[SPEAKER_05]: to America who actually had a preference
for beer and most beer was made from grain
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was very easy to transport that
grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one was, excuse me,
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So prohibition lasted from the 1920s to
1933.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though there were some caveats
within prohibition for people to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: make cider at home because it was illegal
to make and sell alcohol, that still put a
[SPEAKER_05]: big damper on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last one was the temperance
religious movement who wanted to complete
[SPEAKER_05]: and utter ban on all alcohol to the point
where they would go and actually burn down
[SPEAKER_05]: orchards as their method of protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a big test, if you will.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that, there was a huge decrease
in cider production until about 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: During that time, there was an
astronomical growth in the cider industry
[SPEAKER_05]: and this was partially due to crack beer
movement and the great interest in alcohol
[SPEAKER_05]: making.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from that, there's been a 900% increase
in cider production volume alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in New York, in 2015, 2016,
there was over 5 million gallons of hard
[SPEAKER_05]: cider made.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really important in the case of
hard cider, excuse me, cider apples,
[SPEAKER_05]: because cider apples make the best hard
cider you can get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has all the tannins and the phenolic
compounds needed to make a nice complex
[SPEAKER_05]: cider versus culinary apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in New York, this is especially
prevalent because we have around 100 cider
[SPEAKER_05]: producers, which is the most in the entire
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cider producer in every single
state, but we hold the most out of any of
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is actually a lovely example
right here from Black Diamond Farm and
[SPEAKER_05]: Cidery, which I believe that is their
Hickster cider that we got to try last
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's been a great demand for hard
cider apples, but there's been a bit of an
[SPEAKER_05]: issue in actually meeting that demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason for that is something
called biennial bearing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is also known as alternative or
irregular bearing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's two different theories as to
why biennial bearing has occurred.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is the carbohydrate
capacity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, the tree has so much
carbohydrates stored within it to go
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout its growth functions.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing it needs to do is for
growth and survival.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second, everything else, goes towards
flowering and fruit production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fruit production, fruits are a huge
sink of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it does this, and I'll show you
pictures in the next slide, apples tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: produce thousands of flowers when they are
blooming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it puts so much of its carbohydrates
into making those fruit that it needs,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it doesn't actually produce the
flower buds needed for the next year,
[SPEAKER_05]: because they initiate that the year
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they almost need that rest period to
reestablish its internal carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_05]: reserves.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second theory is, as you can see from
the graph right here, involving plant
[SPEAKER_05]: hormone balance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of them is the inhibition of flower
bud initiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is done in the seeds of the fruit
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they signal gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gibberellins are a flower bud inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when a tree is absolutely loaded with
fruit, it's also loaded with a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: maturing seeds, which means that it has a
lot of gibberellin being produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And during those years, there's not that
much leaf production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say that because leaves are actually
the initiation site for something called
[SPEAKER_05]: fluorogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fluorogen actually initiates flower
bud initiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you have a heavy crop load year,
you don't have that many leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the tree's getting overloaded with
gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, it's not going to initiate new
flower buds for the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other year, the off year,
it has a lot more vegetation by comparison
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be saying, OK,
initiate lots and lots of flower buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we get something called an
on and off year for trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, you don't get consistent
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: For culinary apples, there has been
methods of taking care of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what they want to prevent is this right
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see, this is a picture I took
from the Angry Orchard Research and
[SPEAKER_05]: Development Orchard in Walden,
New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the tree is starting to become
overloaded with flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not taken care of, it can be
overloaded with fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overloaded with fruit and not really be
able to go to the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what apple farmers do for culinary
apples, which is what you buy at the
[SPEAKER_05]: grocery store, is they'll go through
thinning practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the quality that those apple farmers
want is different than what you get inside
[SPEAKER_05]: our apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they go through something like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for culinary apples, the qualities
they're looking for is related to fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: size, and the overall appearance of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, fruit size and yield are
inversely related.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the larger the fruit, the lower the
yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more yield, the smaller the fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're trying to get the most bang for
their buck and trying to find that nice
[SPEAKER_05]: middle ground economically for them,
which can be shown in this curve right
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So apple farmers want to go right in here
if they're producing culinary apples to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually make it profitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: All apple farmers are taught this,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem being, this doesn't work the
same way for cider apples, because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for something different when it
comes to quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not exactly looking for size.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking for other components.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the physiology isn't quite the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where Dr. Greg Peck's research
comes in, is trying to find out how to get
[SPEAKER_05]: rid of that biennial bearing and maintain
the qualities needed for cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the part that I was involved in was
done at the Lynn Oaken Farm in Medina,
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is the Oakes family who are
gracious enough to let us conduct the
[SPEAKER_05]: experiment there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while there, we used eight different
hard cider apple varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used Chisel Jersey, Michelin,
Vina Rouge, Dabonet, Harry Master Jersey,
[SPEAKER_05]: Trimlet's Bitter, Darlington Mill,
and Brown Snout.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all European varieties that have
been well known to make good hard cider.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the experiment, this is only one of
three, but this is what I was involved
[SPEAKER_05]: with, was crop flow density and tree
development.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we were doing there is determining
the overall impact of tree growth on crop
[SPEAKER_05]: load management, because they're closely
correlated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to do that, we measured the
trunk cross-sectional area of the tree to
[SPEAKER_05]: get a proxy for the overall tree size.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was measured centimeter squared.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had two different controls and three
different treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first control was we didn't do
anything to the tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just left it alone to see how it would
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next one was we completely stripped it
of all fruit to see how that would affect
[SPEAKER_05]: growth over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next three was to do a low
crop load, so basically three apples per
[SPEAKER_05]: centimeter squared in the tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we did a medium of six and a high
of nine, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that, we did four single tree
block grids randomized per block.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we did 10 fruit samples from each
replication to be measured later on,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'll explain what the measurements
were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we based the harvesting time off of
maturity assessments done by Craig Kelke,
[SPEAKER_05]: who is a part of the Lake Ontario Fruit
Program.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the measurements that we were going for
were two different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: In culinary apples, you want to have a
little bit of starch left over in it,
[SPEAKER_05]: because culinary apples are actually
stored for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cider apples are very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually want them to be harvested as
close to the ripeness as possible,
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're not usually stored.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're usually pressed immediately to
have juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to have different components.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we're doing things like
measuring fruit maturity, the starch
[SPEAKER_05]: pattern index, the fruit firmness,
and the total soluble cells to measure the
[SPEAKER_05]: sugars and everything else involved,
trying to get it so we can get as much
[SPEAKER_05]: needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dr. Greg Peck's lab also measured the
cider quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So things like pH, titratable acid,
the phenolic contact, the yeast-assentable
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen, things that are very important
where you're going through a fermentation
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be the right pH for the
fermentation for the yeast to survive?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to have the needed phenolic
compounds and the acids to actually create
[SPEAKER_05]: the complexity that we want?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there going to be enough nitrogen there
for the yeast to do what it needs to,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it needs the nitrogen in order to
ferment properly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are we going to have to do a lot of
additions in order for it to go a
[SPEAKER_05]: performing plant for the cider that we
want?
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on all of this, this is just the
beginning of the project.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've just recently, within the last
month, started actually looking over the
[SPEAKER_05]: results and everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is going to be going on for a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the outcomes and expected benefits of
this are to provide cultivar-specific crop
[SPEAKER_05]: load recommendations to assist growers,
because they are different than what a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of apple growers are used to, and to
provide cultivar-specific harvest index
[SPEAKER_05]: recommendations so they have an idea of
when to harvest for what they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to finish it off, I would like to
acknowledge Dr. Greg Peck right there and
[SPEAKER_05]: right there with the other interns that I
worked with last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also like to thank Dr. Marvin
Pritz, who actually got me onto the fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: orchard internship, because I was actually
his intern.
[SPEAKER_05]: We helped each other a lot with different
researchers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank Craig Kelke,
who worked with Cornell Cooperative
[SPEAKER_05]: Extension and the Lake Ontario Fruit
Program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd also like to thank the New York
State Apple Growers in the Apple Research
[SPEAKER_05]: Development Program, who helped fund this
project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll be willing to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was tempted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how well that would have
gone.
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support New York apple cider makers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great presentation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm also really interested in the
biannual bearing problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one way that I've seen to control the
crop load is to examine what they call the
[SPEAKER_09]: spur extinction rates.
[SPEAKER_07]: The what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Spur extinction rates.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, how often do these
vegetative spurs disappear and they don't
[SPEAKER_09]: produce flowers anymore?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just curious, in terms of cider
production, are there a lot of genetic
[SPEAKER_09]: resources of specific genotypes that have
this characteristic in which we might be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to exploit?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how much genetic research has
been done for hard cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a renewed interest in looking
into the genetics and actually start
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding for more hard cider varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we know that more for culinary
apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there's research out there,
I'm not sure how much there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's probably not based here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's actually a growing
interest in looking into things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will be more research on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie?
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_23]: Great job, Katie.
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.
All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our next speaker is Natalie Roach.
[SPEAKER_18]: And today, is that me or you?
[SPEAKER_18]: What?
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some feedback or something.
[SPEAKER_18]: Today, Natalie will be talking about
spreading the word on plant nutrition and
[SPEAKER_18]: sprouts.
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for that, Chris.
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm Natalie.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I had an internship this past winter
with Cornell Cooperative Extension in
[SPEAKER_22]: Seneca County.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm also a plant science major
concentrating in plants and human health.
[SPEAKER_22]: So a little bit of background on Cornell
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_22]: The Smith-Lever Act was passed in 1914 by
President Woodrow Wilson.
[SPEAKER_22]: And this was created to create all these
cooperative extensions connected to
[SPEAKER_22]: land-right universities in order to inform
individuals on new agricultural practices,
[SPEAKER_22]: home economics, and policy changes.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this can involve different farmers that
just want to be very updated on new
[SPEAKER_22]: agricultural policies or techniques.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or it could just be merely community
members that want to just kind of have
[SPEAKER_22]: more insight onto what we're learning
agriculturally from Cornell or other
[SPEAKER_22]: land-right universities.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is the idea of taking the
university to the people and kind of
[SPEAKER_22]: spreading the word, if you will.
[SPEAKER_22]: So some of the benefits of Cornell
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_22]: Since 1914, they've expanded a little bit
to now involve things like life skills,
[SPEAKER_22]: nutrition and health, inform people on
different agriculture sustainability,
[SPEAKER_22]: environmental education, and even job
skills.
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is all with the promise of an
unbiased research.
[SPEAKER_22]: So all of this research comes from either
Cornell or other land-right universities.
[SPEAKER_22]: And all of these can be done in a
community workshop setting.
[SPEAKER_22]: So as seen here, this is kind of more of a
community setting.
[SPEAKER_22]: This one is actually in Essex County.
[SPEAKER_22]: And this one's all growers and fellow
farmers.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're learning different techniques on
cherry tomato and pepper propagation.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or it can also be done one-on-one if you
want to just have a one-on-one meeting and
[SPEAKER_22]: learn about these things.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're also experimenting now with some
webinar and Skype type of thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're expanding even their ability to
get this information across to different
[SPEAKER_22]: people.
[SPEAKER_22]: So although most of these are for adults,
they also have a youth development
[SPEAKER_22]: program.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's with a bunch of kids that can do
summer programs, different cookouts,
[SPEAKER_22]: and just learn different things about
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_22]: And other policies.
[SPEAKER_22]: So here's a couple of these examples.
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's a four-age program with children.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're doing cookouts here.
[SPEAKER_22]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a lecture-style classroom setting,
which was actually the two workshops that
[SPEAKER_22]: I participated in were led in that style.
[SPEAKER_22]: Here is a maple syrup workshop,
actually, which sounds really cool.
[SPEAKER_22]: And here is Cornell Cooperative Extension
at the farmers market.
[SPEAKER_22]: So they're kind of telling different
people that are interested in the
[SPEAKER_22]: vegetables, different ways they grew them,
and just giving them a little bit of
[SPEAKER_22]: knowledge on their food.
[SPEAKER_22]: So my work in Cornell Cooperative
Extension was in Seneca County.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I worked with Moira Tidball and Susan
Pearson, who were two CCE nutritional
[SPEAKER_22]: educators.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so coming into it, my two workshops,
we decided to do something based around
[SPEAKER_22]: plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_22]: And since it's really hard to get access
to vegetables during the winter months,
[SPEAKER_22]: there's not many farmers markets or not
access to local things, so we thought that
[SPEAKER_22]: we'd create two workshops that people
could grow some plants in their own home.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I did a sprouts workshop, where we
taught people how to grow sprouts indoors,
[SPEAKER_22]: just in your window sill, as well as a
herb workshop at the Let's Garden Day,
[SPEAKER_22]: teaching people how to just grow some
herbs and the potential benefits.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or you can just put it in your window sill
and then transplant it into your garden in
[SPEAKER_22]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_22]: So why did we choose sprouts specifically?
[SPEAKER_22]: So sprouts contain a really concentrated
amount of vitamins and minerals.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the shoot of the plant with usually
some two cotyledons on it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it has a really packed amount of
vitamins and minerals.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also really low in calories.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a good way to add some flavor to
dishes.
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you have something like a radish
sprout, which is really spicy,
[SPEAKER_22]: and you want to flavor up your salad or
stir-fry it, you can toss those in there,
[SPEAKER_22]: give the nutritional benefits as well as
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, some of them have really good
textures as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: It can be really crunchy.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're also organic, fresh, and they can
be grown all year round if you're growing
[SPEAKER_22]: them right in your home.
[SPEAKER_22]: And something that I found was really
cool, Dr. Clive McKay, who was a Cornell
[SPEAKER_22]: nutrition professor during World War II,
was the one who actually brought the idea
[SPEAKER_22]: of sprouts to the public eye.
[SPEAKER_22]: So my sprouts research process,
I was researching different primary
[SPEAKER_22]: articles from Cornell or other outside
universities, looking at the different
[SPEAKER_22]: nutritional benefits, growth time,
flavor, and then putting this all together
[SPEAKER_22]: in a giant chart.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can kind of pick whatever you're
wanting to have and grow those
[SPEAKER_22]: specifically for whatever you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether that was flavor, texture,
just certain vitamins.
[SPEAKER_22]: The ones that we focused on was radish,
broccoli, chickpeas, lentil, alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_22]: Chinese cabbage, and mustard seed sprouts.
[SPEAKER_22]: I also researched a bunch of the USDA
nutritional data that consumers might find
[SPEAKER_22]: important, such as protein amounts.
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, a half a cup of chickpea
sprouts, which is not very much at all,
[SPEAKER_22]: has the equivalent protein of four eggs.
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's really great if someone's like a
vegan or vegetarian to know that,
[SPEAKER_22]: and they can incorporate that into their
meals and get enough protein.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the sprouts workshop was presented in
the beginning of January at the Cornell
[SPEAKER_22]: Cooperative Extension Office in Seneca
County.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I told people a little bit about what
are in sprouts, their different
[SPEAKER_22]: nutritional, medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_22]: The nutritional benefits focused a lot on
these vitamins right here, the folate,
[SPEAKER_22]: vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin C,
and iron.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I also incorporated some of the
medicinal benefits that some of these
[SPEAKER_22]: sprouts may have.
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, like if they had really high
levels of glucosinolate, which can act as
[SPEAKER_22]: an anti-cancer compound, or if they needed
in digestion or something like that.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can incorporate all these medicinal
benefits in with these different sprouts.
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the questions someone had was,
why would I want to eat these sprouts for
[SPEAKER_22]: these vitamins instead of just taking a
dietary supplement?
[SPEAKER_22]: And my answer to that was that these
sprouts contain a bunch of different of
[SPEAKER_22]: these compounds and these vitamins.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that although they may provide the,
I guess if you could take a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_22]: dietary supplements, they kind of come
together in different things.
[SPEAKER_22]: Also micronutrients, they complexly break
down in your body where one vitamin may
[SPEAKER_22]: have a role in absorption of another.
[SPEAKER_22]: And they also have different compounds
like antioxidants, maybe
[SPEAKER_22]: anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial,
all of those kinds of compounds as well
[SPEAKER_22]: that work within your body.
[SPEAKER_22]: The dietary supplements may not provide
you.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then Moira Tidball, who is one of my,
one of the CCU nutritional educators,
[SPEAKER_22]: presented on how to actually grow these
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can grow them in either like a
colander, like up here.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's these trays down here,
and these can be bought at country time,
[SPEAKER_22]: which is kind of up by Truman Ferg over
there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's like a bunch of different ways
you can grow these sprouts right in your
[SPEAKER_22]: window sill.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there was a mason jar in the
previous slide that you can put right in
[SPEAKER_22]: your window sill, and you just wash it
once a day.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_22]: So she presented a little bit.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then all of our workshop attendees,
which was about 25, 30 people,
[SPEAKER_22]: got to leave with a mason jar,
a filter, a bunch of sprouts, and some
[SPEAKER_22]: sprout seeds to start the round.
[SPEAKER_22]: So some of the health concerns that have
been kind of in the news recently,
[SPEAKER_22]: especially a new case of Jimmy John's
sandwich shop was with presence of E.
[SPEAKER_22]: coli and salmonella while growing these
sprouts because the sprouts growing
[SPEAKER_22]: environment is very conducive for these
bacteria since it's warm, moist,
[SPEAKER_22]: and everything's very close together.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the FDA suggests that you cook your
sprouts before you eat them to get rid of
[SPEAKER_22]: these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_22]: However, people don't usually eat cooked
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_22]: You usually eat them raw on a salad or
sandwich or something.
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you wash them for two minutes,
and kind of the mechanical process of
[SPEAKER_22]: washing it helps to get rid of some of
that bacteria.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or if you do want to try to get to kill
these, but you don't want to lose all of
[SPEAKER_22]: those vitamins and minerals that may break
down in the heating process, it's
[SPEAKER_22]: suggested to actually steam them.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I guess that that retains a lot of
those compounds without actually,
[SPEAKER_22]: and then you kind of can steam them and
kill some of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_22]: Also to refrigerate them after you harvest
your sprouts to decrease the prevalence of
[SPEAKER_22]: those bacteria.
[SPEAKER_22]: And if they smell musky, have dark buds,
or look slimy, then don't consume them
[SPEAKER_22]: kind of like in this picture right here.
[SPEAKER_22]: So for the second workshop, which was on
March 18th, was presented in Ovid at
[SPEAKER_22]: Firehouse.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was during the Let's Garden Day.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I researched a bunch of different small
herbs that are local and people are
[SPEAKER_22]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_22]: So lavender, parsley, dill, cilantro,
basil, and mint.
[SPEAKER_22]: And those kind of have varying properties.
[SPEAKER_22]: Some are used as seasoning and dishes.
[SPEAKER_22]: Other can be used as inhalation therapies,
such as lavender, for like stress relief.
[SPEAKER_22]: Some can be used in drinks like mint.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I talked a bit about the
nutritional and medicinal properties of
[SPEAKER_22]: those as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: And they also had kind of similar vitamins
and minerals, and also their medicinal
[SPEAKER_22]: properties, such as lavender with the
inhalation therapy to help with anxiety
[SPEAKER_22]: and help you sleep, I guess, at night.
[SPEAKER_22]: So then Susan Peterson, which is also one
of the CCE educators, talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_22]: about how to grow these, certain dos and
don'ts of planting these herbs,
[SPEAKER_22]: some potential threats from pests,
or maybe if you were to water them too
[SPEAKER_22]: frequently, what would happen.
[SPEAKER_22]: So just kind of suggestions towards
people.
[SPEAKER_22]: They were fellow gardeners, though.
[SPEAKER_22]: So usually this was given on a little bit
higher of a scientific level than the
[SPEAKER_22]: general audience that was presented for
the Sprouts workshop.
[SPEAKER_22]: We also talked about some preservation and
recipes.
[SPEAKER_22]: So like you can freeze herbs, actually,
to kind of preserve their freshness and
[SPEAKER_22]: then just use them whenever you're
cooking.
[SPEAKER_22]: And we had a bunch of different recipes we
made with all these herbs, and we're able
[SPEAKER_22]: to give them out to people.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then had some precautions that these
herbs, if you're using them for medicinal
[SPEAKER_22]: purpose, they can have certain side
effects or interact with another
[SPEAKER_22]: medication you're taking.
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you were actually trying to take
these herbs daily for a certain medical
[SPEAKER_22]: issue, then to consult a physician.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this was the Let's Garden Day in Ovid.
[SPEAKER_22]: And this was the classroom setting for all
of these fellow gardeners.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was with a bunch of other people
from Cornell, as well as IC, that
[SPEAKER_22]: presented on different gardening
techniques or maybe some pathogens or
[SPEAKER_22]: pests that may be in the area.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I would really like to thank the
CCE Seneca County Office, as well as Moira
[SPEAKER_22]: Tidball and Susan Peterson, and Patty
Batley, who organized the Let's Garden
[SPEAKER_22]: Day.
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I will take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite sprout growing method
and what's your favorite sprout?
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the tray method works really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_22]: We grew a couple different rounds of
sprouts while I was working there on the
[SPEAKER_22]: trays.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of hard to tell in that picture,
but the trays have four different
[SPEAKER_22]: sections.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can grow four different types of
sprouts in it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Just kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we were able to pass it out and
whatever you were kind of in the mood for.
[SPEAKER_22]: I like the radish sprouts the best because
it was really spicy.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I thought that was great.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you could just kind of take out
whatever sprouts you really wanted and put
[SPEAKER_22]: them into the smoothie, stir fry,
whatever you wanted.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_22]: I like that one the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, the penultimate speaker of the day.
[SPEAKER_18]: Penultimate.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can learn a new word.
[SPEAKER_18]: Penultimate is a great word, second to
last.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Megan Dodge is speaking next.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Megan will be talking about her
internship at the Central Park
[SPEAKER_18]: Conservatory Lessons in Urban Park
Horticulture and Management.
Megan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going into landscape architecture.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is going to be a pretty different
talk than the ones that you've heard so
[SPEAKER_08]: far.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to kind of set the stage,
an overview of what Central Park is and
[SPEAKER_08]: its origin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was designed by landscape architect
Frederick Law Olmsted and architect
[SPEAKER_08]: Calvert Vox in 1858.
[SPEAKER_08]: They won a design competition to create
this massive park in the middle of
[SPEAKER_08]: Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 843 acres, which is about 6% of
Manhattan's total acreage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a pretty big deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And its design was supposed to be an
escape from urbanism.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once you're in the park, you don't even
realize you're in a city anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so some yearly stats.
[SPEAKER_08]: 42 million people visit Central Park every
year, which makes it the fourth most
[SPEAKER_08]: visited destination in the entire world
behind the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of
[SPEAKER_08]: China, and the Taj Mahal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gets a ton of traffic.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just like a normal day in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a $70 million budget per year,
which is supplemented by the Parks
[SPEAKER_08]: Department, but it's also mostly funded by
private donations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as far as horticulture goes,
I was a horticulture intern.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the garden that I worked in,
the Shakespeare Garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an essential green space in New York
City.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has tons of different plant species.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are very coveted plant
species.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the largest American elm grove in
the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a lot of you might know, such elm
disease is a problem that's decimating
[SPEAKER_08]: American elm populations across the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty impressive that this
massive collection of elms can still exist
[SPEAKER_08]: in one place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout the park, there is a lot of
variation in design and habitat.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three different woodlands,
a variety of wetlands like lakes and
[SPEAKER_08]: creeks and ponds.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are formal and informal gardens.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Shakespeare Garden where I worked was
an informal garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some native plant meadows that show
off New York State native plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my duties as a horticulture intern,
I shadowed a zone gardener for the
[SPEAKER_08]: Shakespeare Garden, and I helped him with
his daily tasks, everything from staking
[SPEAKER_08]: and pruning, watering, picking up trash,
to designing bed layouts.
[SPEAKER_08]: This down here is a bed that we designed
at the beginning of the summer,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was huge and gorgeous by the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I had a photo of it, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: To picking out plants for the following
season.
[SPEAKER_08]: So stuff that's in bloom right now,
I helped pick out, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the biggest part of my job,
though, was just interacting with and
[SPEAKER_08]: assisting partners and our patrons,
because there's so much traffic in Central
[SPEAKER_08]: Park.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every other second, people are tapping you
on the back asking you, where's the
[SPEAKER_08]: bathroom?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me about this plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a big part of it, just talking
with the public.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, the internship program
offered opportunities to tour and
[SPEAKER_08]: volunteer at other New York City parks in
the different five boroughs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to see a lot of different New
York City parks and help out with various
[SPEAKER_08]: projects.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's just some photos of the
variation that you can see in Central
[SPEAKER_08]: Park.
[SPEAKER_08]: Up there is the Conservatory Garden,
a little lily pad pond.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the American Elm Stand.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a super famous area of the park
called the Mall.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've probably seen tons of movie shots
in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Harlem Mirror, and then the rest of
these plants are in the garden that I
[SPEAKER_08]: worked in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so with all that being said,
there's some problems with Central Park,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I want to kind of go over those.
[SPEAKER_08]: For being a green space, it's very not
green.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a lot of inefficiencies,
one of them being that it doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_08]: waste disposal system for plant matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no composting system in place.
[SPEAKER_08]: They tried to do a composting system in
one part of the park, but it wasn't hot
[SPEAKER_08]: enough to actually degrade the material,
so they ended up dispersing tons of
[SPEAKER_08]: invasives across the park and causing a
lot more problems than health.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tree and turf maintenance takes up a ton
of the budget.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to keep trees like the American
Elms alive that really are just inevitably
[SPEAKER_08]: going to die.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to keep grass green throughout the
entire summer when people are constantly
[SPEAKER_08]: walking on it, so they recover the lawns
multiple times per season, which is very
[SPEAKER_08]: costly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also removing invasives like mugwort,
and pokeweed takes up a lot of time,
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of money because there's no protocol
for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once an invasive is removed, nothing is
done to prevent it from coming back,
[SPEAKER_08]: so it has to be done like every few weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: As of now, there's really no foreseeable
improvements to these because the park has
[SPEAKER_08]: priorities on aesthetics versus
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the gardeners.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are some of the people that I work
with every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Russell Rydell, the zone gardener
for the zone that I worked in.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Larry Bowes, the head gardener for
the Shakespeare Garden, who's the mentor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Lisa Kozlowski, the head of the
Hallett Nature Sanctuary.
[SPEAKER_08]: They make the park what it is,
and they're very educated and passionate
[SPEAKER_08]: about what they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all went to school for horticulture
and aboriculture in Botany, and so they
[SPEAKER_08]: really know what they're doing,
and they really care about how the park
[SPEAKER_08]: looks and how it runs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, in the park system,
they're rather underappreciated and
[SPEAKER_08]: underrepresented.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of big decisions that are made,
they're not really filled in on,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not asked about.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're treated as scapegoats,
so any sort of problem that might happen,
[SPEAKER_08]: like on the ground floor of the park,
it's often blamed on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, they're made to do tasks
below their merit.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're made to spend at least like an
hour a day or more picking up trash,
[SPEAKER_08]: or picking up someone's dog's poop that
they didn't pick up, like all this stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: that really their time could be used more
wisely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these problems stem from the hierarchy
of the central park system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wealthy donors kind of reign supreme here.
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said earlier, they make up the
largest portion of the budget,
[SPEAKER_08]: so they kind of get the most say in what
happens in the park.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lack of communication between
upper management and the gardeners,
[SPEAKER_08]: and this leads to a lot of flawed
landscape designs and inefficiencies,
[SPEAKER_08]: because gardeners aren't consulted when
really they're the ones who see the park
[SPEAKER_08]: on a day-to-day basis and know what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, upper management values
politics more than the park.
[SPEAKER_08]: They care about connections, they care
about knowing New York elites,
[SPEAKER_08]: and middle management is essentially
non-existent.
[SPEAKER_08]: As of the beginning of June, 50 people
were fired, that's 8% of the staff,
[SPEAKER_08]: and so now there is like no one in the
middle to kind of like provide a checks
[SPEAKER_08]: and balances system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some smaller solutions to these
problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are just solutions that I'm kind of
proposing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that they're going to be put in place,
but I think that there are some problems
[SPEAKER_08]: that can be solved.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smaller solutions for the near future,
a composting site that's pretty doable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just find a site that can get hot enough,
have a protocol in place for separating
[SPEAKER_08]: out invasives from things that can be used
in compost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Replacing problem plants such as replacing
a certain type of grass that might brown
[SPEAKER_08]: easily or not withstand heavy traffic with
a hardier species.
[SPEAKER_08]: Invasive management protocol, so have some
sort of system for when you remove an
[SPEAKER_08]: invasive, prevent it from coming back by
laying down cardboard or some sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: chemical deterrent.
[SPEAKER_08]: For further future solutions, global
warming should really be addressed in
[SPEAKER_08]: Central Park.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the largest green spaces in
the city.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it holds a lot of power there for
stuff that can be done to kind of address
[SPEAKER_08]: global warming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Use reference sites such as Governor's
Island Park, which was recently built on
[SPEAKER_08]: Governor's Island.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's built to withstand 100 years of sea
level rise.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gowanus Canal Park, which is in the
process of being built in Gowanus,
[SPEAKER_08]: Brooklyn, which has a lot of planting that
deal with vital remediation, like removal
[SPEAKER_08]: of toxins from the soils and water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are both great ideas for sort of
mitigating problems using our green spaces
[SPEAKER_08]: that we already have.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the gardeners go, some things
that can be done to give them more of the
[SPEAKER_08]: respect they deserve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps would be signs that say respect
the park, respect its caretakers so people
[SPEAKER_08]: know that the gardeners are really
qualified people and that they deserve to
[SPEAKER_08]: be respected.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, maybe a rebranding could be
done, taking cues from National Park
[SPEAKER_08]: Rangers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have this cool title, they have
matching uniforms, something like that
[SPEAKER_08]: just to like give the Central Park
gardeners more oomph.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the kind of hierarchy of the
Central Park system, the public,
[SPEAKER_08]: like New York City public now is aware
that there are problems in the system
[SPEAKER_08]: because it was widely reported on when all
those people were fired.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty clear that things need to
be changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gardeners are becoming a lot more vocal
and they're united in their decision to
[SPEAKER_08]: want to be heard, to want to have more say
in what upper management decides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, gardener supervisors are in
a great position for upward mobility into
[SPEAKER_08]: middle management because when all those
people were fired, they kind of took on
[SPEAKER_08]: that job anyways.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beyond Central Park, these are some things
that should be addressed long-term in the
[SPEAKER_08]: park system.
[SPEAKER_08]: No two parks are alike in New York City
and that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The New York City Parks Department is
spread pretty thin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have a ton of funding and the
funding that it does have, it kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: displaces towards wealthier areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, Highline in Chelsea,
Manhattan gets a ton of funding.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a whole bunch of gardeners versus a
park like Marine Park in Brooklyn that has
[SPEAKER_08]: literally one gardener even though it's
about four times the size of the Highline
[SPEAKER_08]: and almost no funding.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think hopefully over time that can
be addressed so all the parks can be
[SPEAKER_08]: equally beautiful and equally well cared
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a thank you, I'd like to thank Shanna
Blanchard.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was the head of the internship
program.
[SPEAKER_08]: She hired me and she was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: She showed us all around New York City.
[SPEAKER_08]: Larry Bose, who is my mentor and Russell
Rydell, who I learned a lot from just over
[SPEAKER_08]: the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I can take your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it not a good thing that all those
parks are alike?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that some of the parks like
really have a lot of potential but they're
[SPEAKER_08]: just left to sort of degrade because they
don't receive the same funding that a park
[SPEAKER_08]: in a wealthier area would get.
[SPEAKER_08]: In funding and in staffing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the Highline has dozens of gardeners
versus other parks, only a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: Our final speaker of the day is Woohoo for
Matt or Moohoo for final speaker.
[SPEAKER_18]: Both, right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our final last but never ever least would
be Matthew and he'll be talking today.
[SPEAKER_18]: I still love the title.
[SPEAKER_18]: Summer stress not so amazing.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you Chris.
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm Matt and I'm going to talk about
summer stress, which if you're a corn
[SPEAKER_27]: plant is not so amazing.
[SPEAKER_27]: So specifically I'm going to be talking
about my experience this past summer.
[SPEAKER_27]: Working in Dr. Ying Sun's lab in soil and
crop analysis.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was part of the beginnings of a large
scale field experiment that is based at
[SPEAKER_27]: Musgrave Farm, which is in Aurora,
New York.
[SPEAKER_27]: And the objective of the experiment that
we were setting up is that we want to
[SPEAKER_27]: gather large scale phenotypic data on corn
crops and fields.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we did not set up controlled
environment, rather we wanted to just see
[SPEAKER_27]: how corn crops respond to whatever mother
nature decides to throw at them.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so in looking at that, we measured a
lot of different physiological parameters
[SPEAKER_27]: on the corn crops and fields.
[SPEAKER_27]: So to begin with, why are we interested in
corn?
[SPEAKER_27]: Why does corn matter?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, for one, corn is the biggest crop in
the USA economy.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's extremely important for export.
[SPEAKER_27]: We export a lot of the corn that we
produce across this country.
[SPEAKER_27]: We also use a lot of the corn that we
produce in things like livestock feed.
[SPEAKER_27]: And just to give you an idea of some of
the numbers, last year alone, corn
[SPEAKER_27]: constituted 68% of our production in grain
and oil seed harvest.
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you haven't gathered, it's a pretty
important crop.
[SPEAKER_27]: So before I begin talking about the
materials and methods that we used,
[SPEAKER_27]: I said that we gathered data on a few
important physiological parameters in the
[SPEAKER_27]: corn that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_27]: And the first one of those is water
potential.
[SPEAKER_27]: So water potential is basically a measure
of the water pressure inside of a plant.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a measure for whether or not that
plant is feeling water stressed at the
[SPEAKER_27]: time.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you find that the water potential is
usually measured in a unit like a bar
[SPEAKER_27]: because it's pressure.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you find that the water potential is
looking pretty negative, that plant is
[SPEAKER_27]: probably feeling dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you find that you rather have a pretty
positive value for water potential,
[SPEAKER_27]: then that plant's doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_27]: We also measured gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_27]: And gas exchange, in this case,
specifically relates to the amount of CO2
[SPEAKER_27]: that is assimilated by a plant.
[SPEAKER_27]: Because plants use CO2-filling atmosphere
to assimilate that and fix that into
[SPEAKER_27]: carbohydrates via photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then a byproduct of photosynthesis is
oxygen gas, which plants produce during
[SPEAKER_27]: the light reactions.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the third parameter that we
looked at largely is chlorophyl
[SPEAKER_27]: fluorescence, which, and I'm going to give
you a little review of biochemistry here,
[SPEAKER_27]: is I think it's a pretty interesting
topic, but it's also a complicated one.
[SPEAKER_27]: So basically, when a plant takes in light,
photons of light from the sun,
[SPEAKER_27]: that light can basically have one of three
different fates.
[SPEAKER_27]: One of those is photochemistry,
which is just another term for
[SPEAKER_27]: photosynthesis that uses that light energy
to make sugar.
[SPEAKER_27]: That light can also be given off as heat.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's dissipated as heat.
[SPEAKER_27]: The third fate is fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, chlorophyll, which is the pigment,
chlorophyll A and B, which are the
[SPEAKER_27]: pigments responsible for capturing light,
fluoresce red light, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is a really cool picture under UV
radiation.
[SPEAKER_27]: You can see that chlorophyll fluoresces
red light.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so why would we want to measure
fluorescence?
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if a plant is fluorescing a lot,
then that means that less of that light
[SPEAKER_27]: energy is being directed towards
photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_27]: So high fluorescence, likely a lower value
for photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_27]: So to begin, materials and methods,
we measured water potential by using
[SPEAKER_27]: something called a pressure bomb,
which is basically a giant briefcase with
[SPEAKER_27]: a little nozzle here that you can insert a
little leaf cutting into.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you turn another nozzle,
and you fill a chamber with gas.
[SPEAKER_27]: So you build a pressure, and you get it to
the point at which the water begins to
[SPEAKER_27]: escape the leaf.
[SPEAKER_27]: So at the point at which you see little
water droplets form on the leaf's cut
[SPEAKER_27]: surface, that is basically giving you the
water pressure of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_27]: And typically, our goal is to measure this
parameter in the early morning,
[SPEAKER_27]: so around 7 or 8 o'clock AM.
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of measuring chlorophyll
fluorescence and gas exchange,
[SPEAKER_27]: we used a very wonderful, fancy machine
called a GFS 3000.
[SPEAKER_27]: And how that machine basically works is it
has a cuvette that you clamp onto a leaf.
[SPEAKER_27]: And first, we would dark-adapt a leaf,
which is what you need to do if you want
[SPEAKER_27]: to measure chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_27]: We would take a piece of tin foil and wrap
it around a leaf, so we would dark-adapt
[SPEAKER_27]: it.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we would take the GFS 3000,
which I provided a picture of here,
[SPEAKER_27]: and we would clamp it onto the surface of
a leaf.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that machine would simultaneously
measure the amount of CO2 that was
[SPEAKER_27]: assimilated and basically taken up by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_27]: It would also measure how much O2,
oxygen gas, is being introduced into the
[SPEAKER_27]: atmosphere of that little
microenvironment, the cuvette.
[SPEAKER_27]: And after shining a bright, brief flash of
light on the leaf tissue, it would measure
[SPEAKER_27]: chlorophyll fluorescence to give us an
idea of how efficient that plant was.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the use of the pressure bomb and the
GFS 3000 were things that we largely
[SPEAKER_27]: intended to use in the field, whereas in
the wet lab, we did a lot of chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_27]: quantification by using a UV-Vis
spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_27]: And basically, what we did with this is we
would take leaf tissue from corn plants,
[SPEAKER_27]: we would freeze-dry them, dry them up,
and then we would extract things like
[SPEAKER_27]: chlorophyll A and B and carotenoids from
those leaf tissues, and we would use a
[SPEAKER_27]: UV-Vis spectrometer kindly provided to us
by the Martinez lab on fluorine to
[SPEAKER_27]: basically gain an idea of what the
concentrations of these pigments were.
[SPEAKER_27]: And finally, I wasn't directly involved in
these materials and methods, but we also
[SPEAKER_27]: used a very large metal tower with arms
that we fixed onto it so that we could put
[SPEAKER_27]: data collectors onto the arms that
gathered data on things like ambient
[SPEAKER_27]: humidity, the amount of sunlight,
and just gather data from the environment
[SPEAKER_27]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we also used soil moisture probes,
which were kindly provided to us by Dr.
[SPEAKER_27]: Jeff Antonian, so we could gather data on
soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_27]: Results.
[SPEAKER_27]: So this summer was kind of a washout.
[SPEAKER_27]: We had a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what the stats are for
Ithaca, but in Aurora at Mugs Gray Farm,
[SPEAKER_27]: they had the wettest July for,
I think, around 40-something years.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it was a very, very, very rainy summer.
[SPEAKER_27]: So why is that a problem if you're doing
field work?
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully, in a lab, something like rain
isn't going to be a problem if you're
[SPEAKER_27]: indoors, but if you're in a field where a
lot of the roads are dirt roads,
[SPEAKER_27]: which turn to mud when it rains very hard,
getting to the farm can become a
[SPEAKER_27]: substantial challenge.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so during late June and the month of
July, we had a pretty difficult time
[SPEAKER_27]: getting to the farm to collect data.
[SPEAKER_27]: A few times.
[SPEAKER_27]: So as a result, that delayed our
collection of field data until,
[SPEAKER_27]: I think, it was late July and then to
early August is when we really got hit the
[SPEAKER_27]: ground running with collecting fields.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some hardware that we used became damaged.
[SPEAKER_27]: For instance, we used two data collectors
that we stored inside of a styrofoam
[SPEAKER_27]: cooler, which turned out to not be 100%
watertight.
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the styrofoam cooler right there.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so because water doesn't really mix
very well with computer hardware,
[SPEAKER_27]: we had to go back to the drawing board and
figure out a new way to protect that
[SPEAKER_27]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was an ongoing project.
[SPEAKER_27]: Personally, I thought it was fun,
a fun thing to work on, but it was an
[SPEAKER_27]: ongoing challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_27]: And also the metal tower that I mentioned,
it's tall and it has a lot of arms onto
[SPEAKER_27]: it.
[SPEAKER_27]: So in the case of inclement weather and
high wind conditions, the metal tower
[SPEAKER_27]: wasn't super stable.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was also a sort of concern for us.
[SPEAKER_27]: I will go over the fact that I did get
some data.
[SPEAKER_27]: The other undergraduate student that I
worked with in the lab and I, we did a lot
[SPEAKER_27]: of practice in extracting chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_27]: So what we did is we had some plants that
we basically stored in the sunroom in
[SPEAKER_27]: Bradfield, and then we would snip off the
leaves, freeze dry them, and just practice
[SPEAKER_27]: the chlorophyll extraction procedure on
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_27]: And elephant in the room, the 16th of
June, I don't know what I did there,
[SPEAKER_27]: but I made a mistake here such that I got
much higher reads for chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_27]: carotenoid concentration.
[SPEAKER_27]: So sorry, ignore that.
[SPEAKER_27]: But you can see that from May 30th to June
29th, the values are relatively
[SPEAKER_27]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_27]: And what we saw is that chlorophyll A is
present in greater amounts than
[SPEAKER_27]: chlorophyll B.
[SPEAKER_27]: And of course, both chlorophyll A and
chlorophyll B are present in higher
[SPEAKER_27]: amounts than carotenoids, which isn't
really surprising because the leaves we
[SPEAKER_27]: collected were green, carotenoids are
orange.
[SPEAKER_27]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I want to mention that the reason why
chlorophyll A is in greater quantity than
[SPEAKER_27]: chlorophyll B is because while these are
both the main types of chlorophyll that we
[SPEAKER_27]: see in plant leaves, chlorophyll A is
known to interact more directly with
[SPEAKER_27]: capturing light.
[SPEAKER_27]: So in this way, chlorophyll A is known as
the primary light capturing pigment.
[SPEAKER_27]: So chlorophyll A is present in the
reaction centers, which is like the core
[SPEAKER_27]: of the reaction center that captures the
energy from photons.
[SPEAKER_27]: Chlorophyll B is known as an accessory
pigment.
[SPEAKER_27]: So they are inside of the antenna pigments
that surround the reaction center
[SPEAKER_27]: complexes and leaves.
[SPEAKER_27]: And they basically just play hot potato
with the energy that comes from photons.
[SPEAKER_27]: Valuable takeaway.
[SPEAKER_27]: So in spite of the fact that we were
delayed in getting the field data
[SPEAKER_27]: captured, we were still setting things up
and seeing what worked.
[SPEAKER_27]: I personally had a lot of very valuable
takeaways from this experience.
[SPEAKER_27]: First and foremost, I personally learned
that in the case of doing field work,
[SPEAKER_27]: this requires special planning and
foresight that you might not be applying
[SPEAKER_27]: to working in a wet lab.
[SPEAKER_27]: For instance, as I said, rain shouldn't be
a problem when you're working in a wet
[SPEAKER_27]: lab.
[SPEAKER_27]: Rain and inclement weather are absolutely
something that needs to be considered when
[SPEAKER_27]: you're doing a field study, as are other
things like pathogens, which did go up due
[SPEAKER_27]: to the fact that we had very moist
conditions this summer.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I learned the value of proper planning
in this case.
[SPEAKER_27]: Also personally, I had a lot of fun
learning to use cutting-edge equipment,
[SPEAKER_27]: as I said.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had limited exposure to using a pressure
bomb before, which was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_27]: And also, I had never used a GFS 3000
before to gather data on things like gas
[SPEAKER_27]: exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was really, really cool to learn
how to use that.
[SPEAKER_27]: And not just learn how to use those
equipment in the wet lab, where things are
[SPEAKER_27]: pretty ideal environments.
[SPEAKER_27]: But to also carry those out to the field
and learn how to use those in an open
[SPEAKER_27]: environment.
[SPEAKER_27]: I also want to just name briefly the fact
that I think it's really important and
[SPEAKER_27]: enriching to have a balance between field
work and wet lab work.
[SPEAKER_27]: Because personally, for me, that gave me
the chance to see how cellular and
[SPEAKER_27]: molecular processes that I was looking at
in the wet lab can be connected to what I
[SPEAKER_27]: see on the whole plant level in the field.
[SPEAKER_27]: So being able to connect those two
observations and areas of research,
[SPEAKER_27]: I think, is especially important in the
field of plant science.
[SPEAKER_27]: And also, I got to work with some very
knowledgeable and wonderful people in the
[SPEAKER_27]: lab who know a lot about their fields and
were very, very helpful to Julie,
[SPEAKER_27]: the undergraduate student, and I in
learning how to better perform research.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that being said, I would like to
acknowledge Dr. Ying Sun, my PI and the
[SPEAKER_27]: head honcho of the Sun Lab.
[SPEAKER_27]: Dr. Christine Chain, who was the
postdoctoral student that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_27]: Dr. Jeff Malkonian, who provided a lot of
very invaluable insight and help to us and
[SPEAKER_27]: letting us use his soil moisture probes
and helping us set up and run a lot of our
[SPEAKER_27]: field equipment.
[SPEAKER_27]: Dr. Carmen Edid Martinez, who kindly let
us use a lot of her equipment and her lab
[SPEAKER_27]: on floor nine of Bradfield Hall.
[SPEAKER_27]: We used her UVVIS spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_27]: And also Julie Lavon, who was the
undergraduate student that I worked with
[SPEAKER_27]: this summer and who I had a lot of fun
working with.
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you very much, and I am happy to
answer questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions for Matt.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, A, I think it's important to point
out to everyone that farming is hard.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't ever forget that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Meet and thank a farmer.
[SPEAKER_18]: Always.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess in terms of the maize,
what are the plans to repeat things this
[SPEAKER_18]: summer?
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are these experiments going?
[SPEAKER_27]: It is an ongoing project.
[SPEAKER_27]: I am not entirely sure.
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, Julie is returning this summer
from what I heard.
[SPEAKER_27]: I personally am not, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_27]: But yeah, I think it's an ongoing project
together.
[SPEAKER_27]: And this past summer was a lot about
setting up our field experiments and field
[SPEAKER_27]: data and really seeing what needed to be
streamlined and given further attention.
[SPEAKER_27]: So a lot of it was seeing what worked and
what needed more attention.
[SPEAKER_27]: This summer, probably people will have a
better idea of what works and what
[SPEAKER_27]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_27]: And there will probably be a drought.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, because it's every other year.
[SPEAKER_27]: One year we get flood conditions and the
other year we have a drought.
[SPEAKER_18]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you, Matthew.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to thank all of the
students again.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys did a great job.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to get a picture of you to
tweet out.
[SPEAKER_18]: After so you guys can all just hang out
there and Mike has to go there so I can
[SPEAKER_18]: get a picture of everyone.
[SPEAKER_18]: To tweet out and thank Mike, my partner in
crime for this capstone seminar series.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see you all next year.
[SPEAKER_18]: Except you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: You may be excused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
