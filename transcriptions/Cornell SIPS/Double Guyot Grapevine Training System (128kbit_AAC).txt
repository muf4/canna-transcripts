[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pruning season and I wanted to show
you what the vine looks like before we
[SPEAKER_01]: prune, during prune, and after pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a pretty standard grapevine
here for the fingerless.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a Riesling block.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called a double guillot or a
two-tier flat bow system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a cane pruned vine last
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's our first cane that comes
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cane here and then a cane here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from our canes we grew the shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here, these are some nice shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the shoots are our buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically our fruiting zone was
right through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our buds would have gone leaf,
leaf, and then cluster, cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see where some clusters came
off here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would go up from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up above here, this was all leaf area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fruit was in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would have hidden in some
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what we need to do is prune these
so that we are laying out some canes again
[SPEAKER_01]: for this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to move up the row here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prepared a vine and cut out a little bit
of the stuff around it so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: better see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a vine that I'm preparing for
pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to do is get rid of these
old canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to lay down new canes so that
they'll produce shoots this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to look at what we have
that's going to be decent for laying down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, this wood is quite poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just snapped it as I was bringing it
around the wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has gray wood that's up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that means that the cane is
basically dead or is in very poor shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not going to work to be a cane
to lay down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There because none of that is going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all gray when you cut through
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not going to work for me to lay
it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking for something to lay down
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't particularly want to use this one
for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that it's very thick in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we call bull wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want something that's a little more
narrow like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second reason is that this is quite
far out from this region that we call the
[SPEAKER_01]: head of the vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we use this one, then we'll have no
fruit production along this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not great either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, there's nothing on this cane
that I can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need any of this down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to get rid of some of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean it up and get it out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get rid of the rest of this cane too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it actually entwined into the
neighboring vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to have to do is find
something else to lay down in its place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, this might be a pretty
decent choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some nice paraderm, as we would
say, this nice brown wood along here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and would probably tie out reasonably well
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a little gray at the end,
but it might be our best choice,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, for what's going to go along
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for now, I'm going to go like this and
get rid of this gray stuff at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need to lay out another cane along
this fruiting wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one looks not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little speckled, a little thicker than I
would like, but we don't really have any
[SPEAKER_01]: good options left here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get rid of this,
cut off this old cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just easier to get these out of the
way by cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the plan's going to be to lay
this one down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to get it through our catch wires
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a clip on our wires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one's clearly a little long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into the next vine, so I'm going
to snip that off there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will go down along that wire,
this one along here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving to the other side of the vine,
we're looking for some canes to lay down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've cut this one off already.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some nice gray wood here that we
know is not going to produce very good
[SPEAKER_01]: buds or shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually got some spots from Fomopsis
right along the cane here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is probably why the cane is
mostly dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, we're looking for two
canes that are close to the head of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vine that we can lay down on these
fruiting wires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see, this one does not look too
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is grayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not going to be very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one gets out a little bit
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, I think this is probably
my best shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get this out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I'll lay this one down along
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need a cane for on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither of these is perfect again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one gets more gray towards the top,
but this one is a little bit bigger with
[SPEAKER_01]: longer internodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hard to decide exactly what to use
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'd probably go for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, I'm going to cut this
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean up this mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this is all dead wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had Fomopsis on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from the neighboring vine,
so I'm going to just cut this out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this here is actually a really,
really long shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've left this one as a potential
trunk renewal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often our trunks will get damaged from
the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Finger Lakes region, we normally leave
a couple of trunks so that we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one gets damaged, we've still got
another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've left this here in case we want to
replace one of the trunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no visible damage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that, when there's cold damage
on the trunk, it can often show up a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is actually this huge shoot that
comes up and across here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get rid of this whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to leave a bud down here though
so that we can use this as a potential
[SPEAKER_01]: renewal again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bud at the bottom here will grow
into another shoot that will grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we want to replace the trunk
next year, we'll have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me cut this out and I'll show you
what this is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to cut off the top of this
because it's longer than we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be our cane for this
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one again is longer than we
need and is really big here at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is going to be our cane that
wraps along this fruiting wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a cane pruned vine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got our four canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of these has a series of nodes on
them right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each node is a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these buds are going to grow into
shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those shoots are going to produce
grapes this growing season.
