[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to start, I want to orient you a
little bit about where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Washington State in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington is a pretty diverse place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just green, rainy Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a landscape shaped by volcanoes,
glaciers, and ice age floods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a pretty interesting place
to drive around and get out if you like to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we are in the middle here in
Wenatchee.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about halfway roughly between
Seattle and Spokane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yakima, the Tri-Cities, Hood River below
us are kind of the other major centers of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit industry in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Portland is down a little bit
closer to Hood River there on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the primary areas where tree fruit are
produced in Washington are pretty close to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Columbia River in this area,
the shaded area roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of these areas are up the
river valleys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the tree fruit in Washington is
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the location of where these
orchards are is really because of access
[SPEAKER_01]: to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ag is a big part of Washington's economy,
particularly Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gray counties here are the top 10,
as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I think, 2010 data from the
Washington Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apples for probably 10, 15 years have
been the largest value, farm gate value,
[SPEAKER_01]: within the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed wheat and continued to
increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit small print up on the left
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I want to point out here is
that of the about $8 billion in farm gate
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2010, about half of that is
horticulture crops within the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just fruit, nursery, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a diverse industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's bulb production up in Whatcom and
Skagit counties as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to talk about apples
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Wenatchee Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture, actually, I got from Januk
Lee, who some of you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wenatchee on this side of the river,
East Wenatchee on this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Columbia going through town.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a springtime photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the lupine and the arrow root
balsam root blooming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's really nice and green,
pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the time of year for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the summer goes on, it's basically
a desert where we live, which has some
[SPEAKER_01]: really big advantages for growing fruit,
because the humidities are low.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is access to water for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really low disease pressure
relative to a lot of other places that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the same crops that are grown there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has some advantages in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that's a little bit curious
about the Wenatchee area in particular is
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference in elevation from the river
level up into some of these benches that
[SPEAKER_01]: are around town, which is roughly about
2,000 meters in difference, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: for something like sweet cherries,
you have the same cultivars that are grown
[SPEAKER_01]: within probably a 10-mile radius that get
harvested over a month just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in bloom dates, because of the
elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of the uniqueness of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about apples in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously the biggest single crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year is the biggest volume crop that
they've ever had, 120 million boxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost 2.5 million tons of fruit,
which so far has been relatively easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: market because of what happened to you all
last spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a bit of nervousness about
what happens over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious is still the biggest one by
volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's down almost 20% in the last 15,
20 years or so, which makes it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to market everything, because
there's more diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't get held hostage to all the
volume and delicious that the buyers know
[SPEAKER_01]: they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big reason why there's that many
apples, part of it is because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: world market that has the demand,
but also it's because of post-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we post-harvestites like to claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, apple biology lends itself to
having the ripening manipulation be
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening extended by storage in controlled
atmospheres, particularly low oxygen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the low oxygen component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's installations like this in
a lot of places in Eastern Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have these just massive rooms
that hold anywhere from 800 to 3,000 of
[SPEAKER_01]: these bins, which hold roughly 20 to 25
boxes, 40 pound boxes equivalent of
[SPEAKER_01]: apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of what we do is really
related to how can you optimize the system
[SPEAKER_01]: such that you can have maximum flexibility
for marketing over an extended period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is really an integral part of
being able to deal with this gigantic
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the keys to making CA work is to
put the right thing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really a key to fruit maturity
at the time when it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, CA is a fantastic technology,
but it works best when you have fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: that's at the right stage of development
when it goes into storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so physiologically, I think those of
us that work on apples would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a point in the development where
fruit is optimum for its long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's related to the onset of the
ethylene climatric.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a horticultural perspective and
from an industry perspective, that point
[SPEAKER_01]: in development doesn't always match with
what the conditions in the field have
[SPEAKER_01]: provided you with any one season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, this is a series of
pictures of Honeycrisp harvested over a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the trade wants is something over
here because they're red.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they can get paid more money
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's times when the biology says
this is what you should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's this compromise that
happens within the industry to balance
[SPEAKER_01]: those two parts of the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And early harvest, if the color's right,
if the fruit looks good and it's at a
[SPEAKER_01]: point where the biology is right,
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't always happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you end up having to pick later,
then there are some issues that the
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse goes through to determine how
long can we hold these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of varieties, that's based
on how firm they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, you're going to have a bit
of a shorter storage life as you move
[SPEAKER_01]: across that range of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I want to talk about a specific
example of this here, predicated a bit by
[SPEAKER_01]: the two types of maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Physiological, which means that the fruit
will ripen after you pick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't just shrivel up and sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, apples are climatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go through a specific series of
events that makes them get ripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to horticultural maturity,
which certainly for a red apple is
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on how red it is, what's it look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes these don't match up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're really waiting until you get
to what's going to make you money as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to what you can store the longest
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for delicious in particular,
over the last really 100 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been a selection process where
material's been vegetatively selected
[SPEAKER_01]: because of how red it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's being redder being better as far
as a marketability standpoint goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just redder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also when it's getting red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we look at an older cultivar
star cane versus a newer one, scarlet
[SPEAKER_01]: spur, the newer ones tend to get redder
earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what that translates into from
an internal qualities perspective is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're redder at an earlier point in
development so that they're harder or more
[SPEAKER_01]: firm at a point where the trade will say
these are what we want color wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why the strains of delicious
that are produced commercially now are not
[SPEAKER_01]: star cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you wait until you get to the
color level where you could be profitable,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're too soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't store them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over the years, there's virtually
none of these produced commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anymore in the Northwest, it's all these
newer strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now on to the volatile part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So apple volatiles, like it is for other
fruit that has aroma as one of its quality
[SPEAKER_01]: components, really are one of the key
components to differentiating flavor and
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma among different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a cultivar, this one in
particular, this process of generating
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening-related volatile compounds is
developmentally regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene is required for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The maturity at which the fruit is
harvested is really important in how well
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit can execute this
ripening-related part of its program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the environment in which the
fruit is stored has a big impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability of fruit to produce these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are some of the things that I
want to talk about for the rest of my
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use three different examples
related to the maturation process,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the impacts of one MCP, one
methylcyclopropene on this process,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the last part is going to be
some work that we've done relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: recently looking at volatile accumulation
during storage rather than after storage
[SPEAKER_01]: when the fruit are taken out and let to
sit at ambient conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about the analysis that we
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically the work that I've been involved
in and that I'm going to talk about today
[SPEAKER_01]: is all based on sampling from intact
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason we've done this is
there's kind of been an overriding
[SPEAKER_01]: objective to develop some sort of quality
assessment that the trade could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seemingly the easiest way to do that
for them would be to be able to do this on
[SPEAKER_01]: intact fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason is that when you cut
apples, or apples in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a whole nother set series of
compounds that tend to get produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since we're interested primarily in
fresh fruit, we've stayed with this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a system for most of the work that
we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we put apples into jars
and let them equilibrate for a period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time with a flowing airstream through
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we collect the compounds that are
coming off the fruit on an absorbent
[SPEAKER_01]: polymer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put them in a glass trap that
is then analyzed using GCMS using this
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a pretty efficient process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some compromises that are made
based on the phase or the material that's
[SPEAKER_01]: used in these traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one, Tenax, has a pretty broad
spectrum of absorptivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that we do quantification
based on setting, using standards based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the same system gives us a way to do good
quantification of what we get in these
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start with maturity here,
a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, maturity is really
important in determining the capacity of
[SPEAKER_01]: apples to produce ripening-related
volatiles after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some data from a paper by Song and
Banger published in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what it's showing here,
this was with Golden Delicious,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that as harvest occurs later in the
season, you go from a fruit that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty unable to produce a lot of
compounds related to aroma to an
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing capacity as both initially at
the point of harvest and then after
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the key things here are that
in the first harvest here where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting substantial production,
you see that the peak in that production
[SPEAKER_01]: is occurring relatively later than it is
in the later harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's happened here is that the
fruit has matured and then started to
[SPEAKER_01]: ripen on the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts to have more of a capacity to
produce these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you pick later and later,
the production maximizes and then actually
[SPEAKER_01]: falls off sooner as compared to the later
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is one of the things that
contributes to post-harvest quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: apple fruit in relation to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you pick earlier, you get a
longer storage life, but you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: inherently less capacity to produce a lot
of these compounds just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: point in development at which it's been
picked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that as background,
we were interested in this problem or this
[SPEAKER_01]: issue specifically in relation to
Delicious cultivar because Delicious is an
[SPEAKER_01]: apple that gets picked relatively early in
its maturation and ripening development
[SPEAKER_01]: because it gets soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you pick it relatively late,
the storage life is compromised quite
[SPEAKER_01]: considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we were interested to do was
to look at really the season of
[SPEAKER_01]: variability in things that are normally
measured in relation to maturity as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as the capacity to produce
ripening-related volatiles at the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest to see how consistent or
inconsistent that was on a year-to-year
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used this strain, Bisbee Delicious,
which is somewhere in the middle between
[SPEAKER_01]: Starking and Scarlet Spur II.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't very many of these around
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't get this red as early
in development compared to something like
[SPEAKER_01]: Scarlet Spur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three of the maturity components that
we measured were internal ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, starch score with a visual
rating using a potassium iodide solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also firmness.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an industry perspective, they don't
typically have this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not something that most warehouses
generate on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're relying basically on what's the
color here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are these two values telling
us about how ripe are these fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are going to assume that the fruit
is fully mature, physiologically mature,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it reaches an internal ethylene
concentration of 1 microliter per liter,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that for a long-term CA, the optimal
starch is just over 2 on a 1 to 6 scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the firmness is just above 70
newtons, then these are the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: the warehouse would look at at the point
of receiving and then make their decision
[SPEAKER_01]: as to whether or not this goes into short,
medium, long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what are we going to do with
this fruit to maximize our marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the four years of the study that
I'm reporting here, there was quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: range, a three-week range of bloom date.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same tree, same block over
four different years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in all of the years,
ethylene started to be produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: starch scores went up, and the fruit got
less firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you compare across the years,
there's some differences that are
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively important in determining the
post-harvest state, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: of these fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, in the first two years,
the ethylene patterns are relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, a bit higher in the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the last harvest, the starches were up
into the higher twos or above.
[SPEAKER_01]: The firmness at the point where the starch
was two was still above 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are good candidates for long-term
CA storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the end, this is one of the things
to keep in mind here is the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: points in all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into the last two,
you see a couple things is that relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, in the harvest period,
the firmness has dropped below 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this year, the starch went up quite
rapidly above that, the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptability for long-term CA,
as opposed to last year when it was only
[SPEAKER_01]: at the last harvest when it was that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what would happen here, if you wanted
to, say, pick in this year for long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: CA, you're going to have to pick pretty
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starch was going to be low, and likely,
these fruit were not going to be red
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, what would have happened
is they would have had to pick later and
[SPEAKER_01]: not put them into long-term CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the analysis of the volatiles that were
being produced, and this is not including
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the other things that the fruit
are producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Principle components analysis here that
accounted for just under 70 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that we've got nice patterns
related to the four years of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red one is the late bloom year,
which will make more sense when we get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit further on here in the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things I want to point out
is that in all of the years, the data is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well clustered around the same
points early in the development period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the real differentiating
factors between the years is as you get
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to the later harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where things are a little bit more
different than they are earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the loadings plot for the same data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, this is driven by the onset of
production of a lot of ripening-related
[SPEAKER_01]: esters that tend to cluster in the top of
this plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things down in the lower areas tend to
be alcohols, aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few esters in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, once right maturity,
physiological maturity has been attained
[SPEAKER_01]: and ripening starts and the fruit starts
making esters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what separates out the data
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all of the things we measured
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same arrangement, same bloom dates across
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The five things at the top here are
growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is starch, ethylene, hours below 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the incidence of, or the severity
of, superficial scald after six months in
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because scald is related to maturity at
harvest in most years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you see as you look across
this plot is that in all of the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest change in volatile production
was at the last two harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it was really relatively abrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where not much was happening before we got
until these last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the year where the bloom was relatively
later, there was quite a different profile
[SPEAKER_01]: in a number of compounds which tend to be
alcohols, aldehydes, which serve as
[SPEAKER_01]: precursors for ester production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an explanation for why this
happened other than this happened in the
[SPEAKER_01]: year where the fruit really had a
relatively less days on the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also, its initial stages of
development was during a period of year
[SPEAKER_01]: where the environmental conditions were
somewhat different than they would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been when bloom was earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are components of,
say, yearly variability in production of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that aren't really very well
understood because it's difficult to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess one of the messages here is
that these patterns are not consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the last two harvest dates being the
point at which there was the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: change in volatile production.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think back to the previous slide,
the other things that we were measuring,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene production, starch, and firmness,
didn't necessarily follow that same
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's happened here is a couple
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me step back here a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group within this cluster,
which you can't really see it as well on
[SPEAKER_01]: here as I can see it here, tends to have
less of a change over this period of time
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to the bottom ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a group of ethyl esters,
which as you let delicious fruit sit out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bench and get ripe, these tend to
increase a bit later than some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other compounds do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those being the group in the bottom
two clusters here, which tend to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: different alcohol moiety in the ester,
butyl, hexyl, propyl, pentyl, and then two
[SPEAKER_01]: methyl butyl acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these compounds, you can make,
if you take a bunch of these and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: mix of the pure standards, you can make
something that smells pretty much like a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice, ripe, red, delicious apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these tend to be produced in volume
relatively earlier in the ripening process
[SPEAKER_01]: than the ethyl group does as a comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that said to us is that,
like the other components of maturity that
[SPEAKER_01]: we measure, this process is a little bit
different every year as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about how this happened
over the four years, in relation to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other components of physiological and
horticultural maturity, this increase came
[SPEAKER_01]: after the point of horticultural maturity
in some years and before it in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes after, what that means is
that this fruit is off the tree before it
[SPEAKER_01]: reaches this stage, and it's not going to
have the capacity to produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things, meaning that they're going
to taste different, even though they may
[SPEAKER_01]: look the same as they did the year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the things that makes
delicious, have some people question that
[SPEAKER_01]: part of its name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next, this is the impacts of 1MCP,
really the influence of ethylene on this
[SPEAKER_01]: process, as well as part of what storage
does to the capacity of fruit to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this part of the study,
we used Gala.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were treated with 1MCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very amazing inhibitor of ethylene action,
highly used in the commercial trade around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were stored either in air or
in a controlled atmosphere at 1 kilopascal
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen and 2 CO2, which is pretty standard
for the industry in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these fruit were held in storage,
and then we took them out, and let them
[SPEAKER_01]: sit for a week at 20 degrees, which is
kind of a standard simulation of transit
[SPEAKER_01]: and retail for apples after they come out
of storage to see how it would impact
[SPEAKER_01]: components of quality, including
production of volatiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a number of treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually kind of old data when we
were trying to look at how much MCP is
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went from 0.1 to 10 microliters
per liter of 1MCP at harvest and then
[SPEAKER_01]: stored in air or in CA alone or with a
treatment of MCP prior to going into
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relatively early in the storage period,
taking out every month for seven months,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see this differential really even at
one month, there's a difference relatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fruit having been treated with 1MCP
prior to storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the storage periods extends,
basically these things really aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: changing very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue circles and the purple ones are
the fruit that have been stored in CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: After about four months, the group treated
with MCP but then stored in air starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: change a bit and does differentiate
between the CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still is higher than the untreated
fruit and the lowest MCP treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's similar for titratable acidity,
which is another component of quality
[SPEAKER_01]: that's important for flavor and aroma,
not aroma, but certainly for flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a loading's plot of the volatile
results from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see on the left, the treatments
progress up and out in the plot with the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of MCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the top, the combination
treatment MCP, CA, or CA alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what tracks over here is the bottom
group here, again, is primarily acyl
[SPEAKER_01]: esters that really give the fruity
components, the ones that are produced
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively earlier in ripening for gala.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you go up and then into the CA
area, these, again, there's a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: ethyl group ones that are present up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what this is showing is that
these tend to be made much more in volume
[SPEAKER_01]: related to these treatments than to the
MCP or the CA ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So esters alone over the same period,
the controls in the lowest MCP treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: which didn't do much for firmness or acid,
see we have this initial increase and then
[SPEAKER_01]: another increase later in storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The later increase also happened in the
fruit that had been treated with the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher rates of one MCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either group stored in CA stayed
relatively low at the longest storage
[SPEAKER_01]: durations compared to the other MCP
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this biphasic pattern, if you will,
is a bit unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we went in to look at what
individual compounds were doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: relation to this pattern, you see that in
the initial period, for the controls and
[SPEAKER_01]: the lowest rate of one MCP, that there's
production of a number of compounds that
[SPEAKER_01]: is higher than it is in the treated fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what these are, again, is this series
of relatively, these simple acyl esters
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't include the ethyl ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then when you look at the,
five to seven month period where we
[SPEAKER_01]: started to see an increase in a lot of
these other compounds within the checks
[SPEAKER_01]: and the low MCP treatment, we also saw
that in all of the MCP treated fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't see this group alone once
the MCP treated fruit started to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity to produce these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what appears to have happened here
is that the treatment with one MCP didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: just delay the onset or the production of
a lot of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really changed the pattern of how they
were produced such that you miss this
[SPEAKER_01]: initial period where you're really only
getting these real fruity, more
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic group of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such that when the fruit regains the
capacity to produce these, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: different suite of compounds, if you will,
compared to this initial period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, why this is happening
specifically is something that remains to
[SPEAKER_01]: be determined.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's not a simple,
well, the fruit is old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to get senescent or
overripe, however you want to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these fruit could be classified
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're low acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are still firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have a lot of acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what it means is that, this whole
process has been altered by having
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene action removed from the equation,
as it were, for a period of time such that
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't really recover the capacity to
ripen normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're getting ripe and they're
doing things that gallows do during that
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the same pattern that you see
in the controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, again, when the second pattern,
second production is this ethyl group,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, along with a number of aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a different group of compounds as
opposed to the one on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what this illustrates is,
you know, MCPs have a big effect on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the trade, gallows aren't stored for a
period of time such that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: experience this increase in air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're going to store them for
a long period, they're going to be this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be the ones that are in
CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean about what they're
going to, you know, what are they going to
[SPEAKER_01]: taste like when you put them in your
mouth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that's not as simple of a
question as you might think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some work that Gene Kuperman,
a colleague of ours at WSU, and Anna Marin
[SPEAKER_01]: from Oregon State University really were
the drivers behind this a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they were, their question,
they wanted to ask is, how do people
[SPEAKER_01]: perceive one MCP treated fruit versus
non-treated fruit that have been,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you've selected using a
non-destructive firmness technique so that
[SPEAKER_01]: firmness is pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you're taking controls that
haven't been treated that are soft and
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing them with treated fruit that are
still hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all about the same firmness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the volatile analysis for a number
of key compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you can see this, that the bold
columns on the right, which are the CA or
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit stored in air that haven't been
treated, are all significantly higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit that have been treated with one
MCP and then stored either in air or in
[SPEAKER_01]: CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what the folks, they gave these two to
test, and they basically said,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have a preference?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is your preference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was pretty interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that when you look at the mean liking
scores for all of these groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: MCP air versus control CA, MCP CA,
control CA, or MCP CA versus new crop
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit from Chile that hadn't been stored,
these scores are all pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the preference scores in general favor
the fruit that have been treated with one
[SPEAKER_01]: MCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that people's preferences for
apple flavor are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a matter of saying,
you've got a lot of these, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some people may, that may be why
they thought these were better,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's been a lot of work like
this done trying to sort this out with MCP
[SPEAKER_01]: on apples and other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, I think, depends on the
questions that you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you want to say that MCP makes
something better or worse, you can do that
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way you set up these consumer type
tests or even taste panel with trained
[SPEAKER_01]: panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as simple of a question as
more is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the other part of that is that
if you think about the differential in
[SPEAKER_01]: production of different groups of esters
as ripening progresses, as the fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: starts to get older and into the phase
where it's producing a lot of ethyl
[SPEAKER_01]: esters, they don't taste the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that changes how the fruit tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you combine that with softening,
more may not be better in that instance as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as how that impacts quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto the last part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is volatile production during CA
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that there's not a lot of
literature about what happens while fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: is stored in low oxygen or high CO2
controlled atmospheres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the work like this has been done,
as I described earlier, where fruit is
[SPEAKER_01]: taken out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's let sit for a while to simulate shelf
life as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you do the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been interested the last few
years to try to develop information that
[SPEAKER_01]: provides a additional management tools as
it were to industry to make determinations
[SPEAKER_01]: about fruit quality and marketability
while it's still in storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that we started
to do was to set up experiments where we
[SPEAKER_01]: would actually do the volatile
measurements while the fruit was still in
[SPEAKER_01]: CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for this group of stuff, we picked two
situations where the environments were set
[SPEAKER_01]: up so that they would cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one being low oxygen,
where we went down to 0.3 kilopascals
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen to try to generate low oxygen
injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason you would actually try to
operate that way commercially is to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent this disorder, superficial scald,
which low oxygen can be a way to at least
[SPEAKER_01]: delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is high CO2 injury of
Fuji, which develops this really wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: internal browning with cavities that when
you look at the fruit, you can't see that
[SPEAKER_01]: it has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we collected the samples for
this is we have our research scale
[SPEAKER_01]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hold about eight of these fiber trays
of fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same collection system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our 10X trap, a little pump where
we would circulate the atmosphere from
[SPEAKER_01]: these chambers onto the traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we could basically do the
analysis on the traps the same as I
[SPEAKER_01]: described earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, we don't have to take the
fruit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not changing the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's staying under the low oxygen or high
CO2 conditions while we're doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ports on the side of the
chambers to get the gas in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the delicious part of this,
I just want to briefly show you we've done
[SPEAKER_01]: this for three years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first two years of this,
the fruit was relatively similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: starch wise, a bit higher in ethylene the
first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three years, the firmness was pretty
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last year, the fruit had much higher
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The starch scores were higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: The acidity was lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are fully mature and started to
ripen, I think, a bit more than the first
[SPEAKER_01]: two years are.
[SPEAKER_01]: All from the same orchard, managed the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the low oxygen concentration on the
left, the amount of time and storage on
[SPEAKER_01]: the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are not equivalent periods as
you go down the axis here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're weighted towards the front end
such that these are all about a week
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts to get longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we saw relatively early on in the
lowest oxygen concentration was an
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation of compounds that we weren't
seeing as we increased the oxygen or as we
[SPEAKER_01]: were storing fruit in air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what these were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's this whole series of ethyl
esters, including ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not surprisingly, apples make esters
really largely based on the alcohols that
[SPEAKER_01]: are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a lot of ethanol there,
you tend to get these ethyl esters earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: than you would if, in this case,
because these apples are not ripe two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other groups where the changes are
not as affected really other than the CA
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to the air fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a whole group down here
which are, again, a lot of the early
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening-related compounds that are being
produced much more in the fruit stored in
[SPEAKER_01]: air than they are in the ones in any of
the CA environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, one of the things that,
regardless of low oxygen concentration,
[SPEAKER_01]: these tend to be produced less,
which I think, you know, if you eat fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out of CA, you inherently know
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot less production or,
you know, you just don't taste these as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as you would if you're eating a ripe
one that's never been in that same
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So low oxygen has this effect,
as it does with galas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different atmospheres did a
predictable job of managing firmness and
[SPEAKER_01]: acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower letters here are the differences
within months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CAs are higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the CA treatments are higher than
the fruit stored in air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only at eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the lowest oxygen in this experiment
was higher than the other two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, we're restricting
part of the ripening process here by these
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the oxygen, the differential in oxygen
is having a pretty big impact on what the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our objectives here is,
okay, can we use measurement of a fewer of
[SPEAKER_01]: these to provide some indication that
there's an issue or not an issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And quantitatively, as you might expect,
ethanol, ethyl acetate are the compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: being produced the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in one year of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this data, I'm sorry, was from
2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're going to try to use one
or two values or compounds to try to make
[SPEAKER_01]: this assessment, you either need to have a
pattern that's different consistently or
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to have a threshold value above
which you would say there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the lines, the slope of the line
of accumulation in the first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly much more rapid in the lowest
oxygen than the fruit stored in air or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other oxygens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we look at the amounts,
in this year, the only treatment that got
[SPEAKER_01]: above 10 nanomoles per liter was the
lowest oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for ethyl acetate, it was somewhere
between four and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's a range where if you were
going to try to do this commercially,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could say this is what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've done this for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in two of the years, the patterns have
been relatively similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two, where we saw this initial rapid
or relatively rapid rise and it continued
[SPEAKER_01]: to go up for, you know, within the first
three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kicker is this one, where this fruit
at point two was anaerobic, it had plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of ethanol, but it didn't accumulate very
well until almost three months in storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're using, you know,
we have to use, if we're using 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to know there's a problem
until we get out to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to maybe be too late to
do something about it within the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this line is, is in this year,
once one of these groups that was stored
[SPEAKER_01]: at point three got up above 10,
we raised the oxygen to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that over time, both for
ethanol and for ethyl acetate,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, not actually not as well here,
the values start to go back down,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning that the fruit can recover once
you put enough oxygen back into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other issue here is that as opposed to
the other year when we used point three,
[SPEAKER_01]: where point eight percent never induced
enough ethanol to get up above 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: it did in this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, this is only three,
this is three seasons with one lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about this in relation
to a whole room full of fruit from
[SPEAKER_01]: different lots, setting a threshold value
to try to do this might be more difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: than you would think as you think about
the biology of fruit and why this happens
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was one of the messages or
the lessons that we got out of this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: from Delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Fuji, only the fruit stored at five
kilopascals CO2 got CO2 injury.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a large group here where
relatively little difference between the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the fruity stuff that tends to
get produced relatively early.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ethyl esters in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look into this cluster,
ethyl esters and some methyl esters as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even at high CO2 is causing a
differential production of a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds as opposed to the fruit
that are stored in air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the issues here again,
okay, what could we pick that might tell
[SPEAKER_01]: us there's a problem is a bit more
difficult because the quantitative
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships between these treatments
aren't really very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's ethanol over here and you see
that this doesn't increase to its maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: until pretty far.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is six months into storage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe not surprisingly,
we didn't see that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at what production of a
few of these did, some of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethyl butyrate, methyl butyrate early on,
there was an increase in all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the treatment differential five to one
and a half to a half, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not a big enough difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if this was something you would
see consistently to be able to say this
[SPEAKER_01]: much is telling you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see over with ethanol is that
Fuji's just inherently make ethanol pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think what happens early on is
they can pretty efficiently take this and
[SPEAKER_01]: make it into esters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not seeing as much of an
accumulation early as we do late when this
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity to produce ethanol continues to
be there, whereas the capacity to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: esters with it actually decreases the
longer the fruit's been in CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably part of the reason why
we're getting this accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's where I want to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the things that we've taken
home ourselves over the years is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, harvest date, season are really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important in ways differently for
different cultivars just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way different cultivars mature and ripen
before they're ready to be picked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene action is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's critical to this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlled atmosphere has effects even
within the different gases manipulations
[SPEAKER_01]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really it comes down to biology for
what the fruit's going to do and the
[SPEAKER_01]: business having to make decisions based on
what the biology has already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the challenge for the
industry and what they do every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the folks that did all this
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave and Janie are technicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luis and Zhitong were post-docs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christy is a master's student who just
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave Riddell is one of our colleagues
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the MCP, actually for the controls,
it wasn't, it never really dipped as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as the ester production did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really, I mean, I think that's
the only time I've seen that biphasic
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've, you know, we've done some,
we're actually repeating this again this
[SPEAKER_01]: year to see if we get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't as much of a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the MCP-treated fruit stored in
air, that's when we saw ethylene start to
[SPEAKER_01]: be produced again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I'd have to go back and look at that
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more in that paper than that
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, they were very careful to
try to minimize the impact of firmness
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this acoustical method for
doing this, I think a lot of people would
[SPEAKER_01]: argue is, I mean, it's, you can,
you have to use that value with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of understanding that it's measuring
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get groups that have the same
value, I think my personal opinion is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can still tell differences because the
texture isn't necessarily the same between
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that's part of what people
were looking at here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was, this was consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were people at the Portland Sunday
or the Portland Farmer's Market is where
[SPEAKER_01]: they went and did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not trained panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just people who like apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, I think that plot is from people
who eat a lot of galas, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even within that population,
there were people that said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we like these, even though it's not making
these other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that my experience certainly has
been that MCP and or CA really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: impact sugar as much as they do other
parts of ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that, it's really
determined at the point of harvest how
[SPEAKER_01]: much starch is there that's going to get
broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ethylene action doesn't appear to
have much of an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the starch degradation process has
started, it pretty much just goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's less of an impact on sugar
as opposed to a lot of the other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the reasons that I have
acidity on there, and for the gal example,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that before MCP was ever around,
one thing that we had noticed is that
[SPEAKER_01]: because in part of the impact that
maturity assessment for Red Delicious and
[SPEAKER_01]: its offset from the capacity to produce
volatiles, putting that into long-term CA,
[SPEAKER_01]: where even if they could produce volatiles
at harvest, it's not going to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient after they come out of CA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That acidity becomes a relatively more
important component of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when it gets too low, and that
number is different depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, you know, the fruit just don't
have much going for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you better have acid left at the
end because you don't have much of these
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, when you look at
the changes in sugar as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, it actually goes up a little bit
because starch is being metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a percentage change, acidity change
is considerably higher than it is for
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar as fruit ripens and it sits in
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different for different cultivars
in part because not everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibiting ethylene action isn't 100%
positive for all cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can argue that it's not
positive for aroma production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also, in some cultivars,
that are sensitive to CO2, it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: extends the period over which they can
have issues if they're exposed to CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for Fuji, for example, where we're
from, you don't want to treat them right
[SPEAKER_01]: away when they're harvested because it
makes it more likely that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have CO2 injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to something like Gala or
Delicious, where firmness management is
[SPEAKER_01]: much more of an issue, so you want to
treat them as soon as you can after
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest because then it has the maximum
impact on preserving firmness and
[SPEAKER_01]: minimizing firmness loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer you wait, the less of an effect
typically that you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, one of the first
experiments that we ever did was in March
[SPEAKER_01]: with Fujis that we got from a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we treated them and then we
let them sit out and we could detect
[SPEAKER_01]: different differences even that late in
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't something that would
have been commercially significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, ethylene is important
throughout that process, at least for some
[SPEAKER_01]: components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you interrupt the ethylene
activity, there are things that happen
[SPEAKER_01]: even relatively late, in our example with
Fujis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1 MCP is a gas, for those of you who
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the current likelihood that a
licensed holder has developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation that can be field applied,
which seems, you know, is kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: technological achievement, at least in,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether or not there are impacts
related to disorders from pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments, I'm not sure that that's been
very well characterized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I haven't been involved in a lot
of that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, have you guys seen anything
related to Harvista and disorders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jennifer Diel has seen, and actually we've
seen this too now I think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of the honey crisp disorders can
actually be less if the fruit has been
[SPEAKER_01]: treated with MCP in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tends to be those that are,
they're chilling disorders but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: related to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think what's happening is that
when you, treat them in the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's slowing down maturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's prolonging the period where
they're not as sensitive to low
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, you know, I think there's a lot more
work that needs to be done in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because right now, one of the things
that the commercial business is trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is to minimize the post-harvest effect
of this material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't want to jeopardize
their post-harvest business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's a lot of opportunities
for that, for different reasons other than
[SPEAKER_01]: just disorder management that remains to
be seen at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
