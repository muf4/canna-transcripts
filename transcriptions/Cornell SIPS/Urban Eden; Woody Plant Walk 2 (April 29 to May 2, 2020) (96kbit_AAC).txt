[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the beautiful Magnolia Sulangiana,
Saucer Magnolia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close up of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a saucer-like shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful dark pink and white
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful day, May 2nd,
and we have some other plants to show you
[SPEAKER_01]: that are blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have Rhododendron PJM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're one of the earliest
Rhododendrons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the beautiful pink flowers here,
tubes, if you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are blooming pink and purple all
over campus right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhododendron PJM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice bank planting of Rhododendron PJM.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are pretty old.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about as big as they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice in early spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhododendron PJM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're noticing Rhododendron PJM at
this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another example right near the
Statler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, it's April 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here showing all these amazing
Pyrus Calleriana, Callery Pears.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in parking lots all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very widely planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they were introduced in the United
States in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They became very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyrus Calleriana, Callery Pear,
and the Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the flowers, Pyrus plant
Calleriana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they'll produce fruit,
little pears, which unfortunately get
[SPEAKER_01]: eaten by the birds and moved around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is considered an invasive tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is very beautiful, very tough,
easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're working on, or other people
are working on, creating a sterile form,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a spectacular old specimen of
Amelanchia in the ILR courtyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably, if not 30 or more years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tall tree, large shrub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Amelanchia species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serviceberry or Shadblow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has beautiful early white flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do well in the sun or the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do well in the sun or the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an early spring blooming plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a close-up of an Amelanchia flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is actually often multi-story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single stem, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can be single stem as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is Caria japonica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early blooming green stem shrub.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very early in spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really good useful plant for the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blooms very well in the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is Mahonia aquifolium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a long flower period,
but if you get it early in the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see these beautiful yellow flowers
of Oregon grape holly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some damage because of the winter on
these evergreen leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, a nice early spring show for
Mahonia aquifolium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
