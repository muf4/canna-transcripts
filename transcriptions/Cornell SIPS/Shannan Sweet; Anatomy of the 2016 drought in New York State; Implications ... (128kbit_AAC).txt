[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Dave mentioned, today I'll be
talking a little bit about the 2016
[SPEAKER_02]: drought in New York State and how that
impacted agriculture and maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: implications for water resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to point out, obviously,
Dave is one of my mentors, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: Rebecca Benner, who is the chief scientist
for all of New York State TMC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really great team.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and just in case anyone forgot,
we had a drought in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know 2017 was pretty wet, so sometimes
we lose sight of what happened just the
[SPEAKER_02]: previous year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are just a few of the headlines
from mid-July through August in 2016,
[SPEAKER_02]: pointing out that this is the worst
drought in almost 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to see how severe was the
drought really from a historical
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all scientists, and we like to
look at these things a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: empirically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing we did was analyze 60
years of air temperature, precipitation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and snowfall data and streamflow data
throughout New York to see just how bad
[SPEAKER_02]: was 2016 relative to the past 60 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we wanted to know, well,
how was agriculture impacted by this
[SPEAKER_02]: drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we surveyed farmers across all of New
York State to get an idea of their yield
[SPEAKER_02]: loss, the economic impact, how they either
worked or were not able to cope with the
[SPEAKER_02]: drought, and how they reacted in real
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, and importantly,
what does this mean for water resources?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we even care how farmers reacted
and how they were impacted by the drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get at this, we actually modeled
crop irrigation water use throughout New
[SPEAKER_02]: York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did this because water use
reporting by the agricultural sector is
[SPEAKER_02]: not well recorded or known.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trapped because unless a farmer is
using over 100,000 gallons of water in a
[SPEAKER_02]: day or 3 million gallons in a month,
they don't actually have to report their
[SPEAKER_02]: water usage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have over 35,000 farms covering 20%
of New York's land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a majority of those farms aren't using
that much water, but you can imagine that
[SPEAKER_02]: adds up, even if a farmer is only using
50,000 gallons a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we modeled it in sort of an average
year, a 15-year mean to get a sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of normal, typical water use,
and then in a drought year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did it look like in 2016?
[SPEAKER_02]: So our study site is New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love this map because it shows all
the agriculture in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is fruits and vegetables and field
crops and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see pretty obvious the
Adirondack State Park, where there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, and Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then importantly, and why we all love
the Finger Lakes and Cornell, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: dense in the Finger Lake region there,
western New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the dots indicate all of the
counties where we had 275 farmers respond
[SPEAKER_02]: to our drought survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty good response rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in August and September of
2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also see that just about every
county with significant agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had farms respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also conducted more in-depth
in-person interviews with 75 of those
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers in January and February.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of post-growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get into my historical analysis
of the drought, I want to point out the
[SPEAKER_02]: drought monitor maps for 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if none of you are familiar with the
drought monitor, there's the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes into account more than just
climatological measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, temperature and rainfall and
so on are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also get subjective opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually ask farmers on the
ground, how are you being impacted by the
[SPEAKER_02]: drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes into these maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, I just want to point out
that in 2016, throughout the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season, the drought monitor map did
suggest that the drought got progressively
[SPEAKER_02]: worse throughout New York State,
and particularly here in western New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pointing that out because not only
do we have a lot of dense agriculture in
[SPEAKER_02]: western New York, where the drought was
the worst, but also I'm going to present
[SPEAKER_02]: some data specifically just from that
western New York region today for the sake
[SPEAKER_02]: of time, A, and B, so that I don't dilute
the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of the agriculture in
eastern New York wasn't impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: similarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The drought wasn't as bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll point out when I'm focusing just
on western New York today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shannon, on that previous slide,
it's quite striking that the area of
[SPEAKER_06]: extreme drought is almost adjacent to an
area of no drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is quite striking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll give you the link and connection
to my publication at the very end of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do go through and analyze very
discreet regions in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is surprising how different the
impact, the historical analysis of the
[SPEAKER_02]: meteorological data and also the
agricultural impact is in just one region
[SPEAKER_02]: that is directly adjacent to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, in the drought maps,
they're taking into account more than just
[SPEAKER_02]: rainfall and temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're thinking about soil types and
other things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it is quite striking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for our data, again, this is going to
be just for that western New York region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is that historical snowfall,
rainfall, and air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I would call maybe the
snow season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the November, December of 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then January, February, March of 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the winter and spring time
leading into 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have rainfall throughout the
growing season and air temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the black lines are that 60 year
average.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1955 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the gray lines for snow and
rainfall are the lower tenth percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that 60 year period, how low did it
get?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for air temperature, it's the
upper 90th percentile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that 60 year range, how hot did it
get?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the red lines are 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty striking here that you can
see snowfall was not only below average
[SPEAKER_02]: for the entire snow season, but it reached
historical lows in November, December,
[SPEAKER_02]: and March.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, rainfall was below average for
most of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reaching historical lows in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get that little peak of rain in
August, but that was too little too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmers had already been pretty
severely affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't compensate for the lack of
snow and rain in the spring and summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And air temperatures were above average
for the entire season, reaching historical
[SPEAKER_02]: record highs in August and September.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of those combined, again,
in western New York specifically,
[SPEAKER_02]: led to record low streams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the lowest stream flows we've ever
seen in the past 60 years, dipping below
[SPEAKER_02]: that historical low in the middle of the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's indicative of not only
depleted surface water resources,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also groundwater resources,
both of which farmers rely on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had plenty of farmers tell us not
only did their ponds and streams dry up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but their wells went completely bone dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that kind of answers the first
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How severe was the drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to this fairly long-term
record, it was pretty historically severe,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in western New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next question, how was agriculture
impacted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is just for western New York,
because the impact on farms in eastern New
[SPEAKER_02]: York was a little bit less severe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this figure is showing on the x-axis
the percent crop loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did a farmer lose 0% to 10% of their
crop, 11% to 30%, and so on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the y-axis, the percent of
respondents, the estimated losses within
[SPEAKER_02]: those ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the thing that jumps out to me
first is that irrigated crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are the striped bars, fared a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see over half of the farmers lost
less than 10% of their crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually maybe a typical annual
loss anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you look at the solid black
and solid purple bars, which are the
[SPEAKER_02]: rain-fed crops, you can see that about
half of the farmers lost over 50% of their
[SPEAKER_02]: crop in western New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables and field crops and different
[SPEAKER_02]: sized farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also see that over 10%,
maybe about 15%, of rain-fed fruit and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable crops saw yield losses of over
90%, so pretty extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we asked them to rate the
economic impact, over 80% of the farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: in western New York said that it was
either moderate or severe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only 1% of all those farmers said,
meh, it was merely a nuisance and there
[SPEAKER_02]: was really no economic impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so now we're shifting to the whole of
New York state.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all 275 farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we asked them, what was it that
limited your ability to maintain your
[SPEAKER_02]: yields, not surprisingly, about 70% said
either irrigation equipment or water
[SPEAKER_02]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we asked them, well,
and this is what we asked them in August
[SPEAKER_02]: and September, what might you have done
differently if you had known in advance
[SPEAKER_02]: just how bad this drought was going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see a relatively similar
distribution for answers relating to
[SPEAKER_02]: changing their crop types or diversifying
or maybe changing the planting dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 22% said we would have bought more
irrigation equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 36% said we would have done
something else that you didn't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: list here, and that included things like
increasing your water storage,
[SPEAKER_02]: so more ponds or wells and other
irrigation infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another big chunk of farmers said that
they would have done things to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: their soil health, so more cover crops,
less tillage, so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another chunk of farmers said
that they would have done something to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase their economic resiliency,
so maybe start doing some of these things
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier or recover field fields or just
increase their ability to feed their cows.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so now this is the follow-up
interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have a sense of what farmers
were thinking in August and September when
[SPEAKER_02]: they were kind of in the thick of the
drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't actually know exactly how much
they had lost yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked them, well, what did you actually
do, and this is in January and February,
[SPEAKER_02]: during the drought, real time,
to cope with this situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: 7% said they changed their irrigation
management strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so often they told me that meant
irrigating at really inopportune times,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe like at 2 o'clock in the afternoon
in the middle of August, just so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: could get through all of their fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: 7% said they created makeshift watering
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were using fertilizer, chemical
sprayers to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were driving their pickup truck to
their neighbors and just filling up jugs
[SPEAKER_02]: of water and using hoses and watering
cans, basically just desperate times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Called for desperate measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16% went out and bought irrigation
equipment, and another 16% invested in
[SPEAKER_02]: water supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they dug ponds or they drilled wells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, with the follow-ups, we asked
farmers, OK, so after what you experienced
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2016, has this changed your perspective
on future drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: Over half of the farmers said yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, we asked them,
all right, we know what you were thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about in August and September in terms of
what you would have done differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You told us what you actually did
differently in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now what are you thinking about doing
in the future to cope with future drought,
[SPEAKER_02]: so maybe in 2017 or in the next few years?
[SPEAKER_02]: 6% said they're going to invest in
irrigation equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: 26% water sources, so again, ponds,
wells, streams, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 11% are going to change their
irrigation management routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a very water-focused
presentation, but I do want to point this
[SPEAKER_02]: out because Dave is so proud of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: 32% of the farmers said to help them cope
with future drought, they plan to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: their soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, cover cropping, reducing
tillage, adding organic matter to their
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that healthier soil increases
your resiliency to these climate extremes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we basically answered number
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers were pretty severely affected,
especially in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this got them thinking about drought
in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are thinking maybe it's going to
occur more frequently and how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to prepare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually saw them change their
behavior and do things that they may not
[SPEAKER_02]: have normally done if they weren't in the
thick of a really bad drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, well, what does this all mean
for water resources in a fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: water-rich, usually relatively humid state
like New York?
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I get into our actual crop
irrigation, potential crop irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: water use, I want to point out this great
figure from one of Dave's publications
[SPEAKER_02]: showing that in a lot of, this is just
Rochester, New York over about a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred-year period, but this could be
said for a lot of regions in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: state where we see precipitation,
the blue line, doesn't quite compensate
[SPEAKER_02]: for potential evapotranspiration,
the red line, during several summer
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the summer water deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what that means is there's
a period in the summer, even historically
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking, where irrigation could actually
increase agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think about the farmers that went
out and bought irrigation equipment in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016, they're probably going to use it
even in a normal year because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: already made that investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we think about, this is where my
climate change minds and thoughts come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summers in New York are predicted to
get longer, quote unquote, just because
[SPEAKER_02]: the freeze-free season length is going to
get longer, and also hotter and drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is data from the North American
Regional Climate Change Assessment
[SPEAKER_02]: Program, and it's comparing a historical
30-year mean to this projected future
[SPEAKER_02]: 30-year mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just for the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all of the different seasons and
the entire United States, so you can check
[SPEAKER_02]: this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check it out online if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially what they're saying is in
the summer, temperatures throughout New
[SPEAKER_02]: York state in the future could increase
anywhere from three to almost six degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit, depending on where you are in
the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Precipitation could decrease three to
about 6%, and the freeze-free season
[SPEAKER_02]: length could increase anywhere from 20 to
30 days in various parts of New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we already have, historically
speaking, a summer water deficit here,
[SPEAKER_02]: a period in the summer where irrigation
could be optimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with climate change, we're going to
see that gray blob get really big and
[SPEAKER_02]: tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you're going to have longer,
warmer, drier seasons, which increases
[SPEAKER_02]: crop water demand, longer seasons,
and hotter summers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you combine that with decreased
precipitation in the summer, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to see a bump in irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now for our water use modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is at the county level.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the manuscript, it's actually going to
be at the DEC drought zone level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one's a little bit finer scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, this image is showing
normal average year potential crop
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation water use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'll give you a link to the
manuscript at the end of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get into all of the
modeling techniques we used, because that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, what you're seeing is,
on average, most counties throughout New
[SPEAKER_02]: York state use maybe 10,000 to 100,000
cubic meters of water throughout an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually not that much water
use, with a few counties maybe using
[SPEAKER_02]: 100,000 to around 800,000 cubic meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we have Long Island
with sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a lot of sod and heavily
irrigated agricultural acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if we look at a year like 2016,
it gets really colorful all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_02]: because now counties are using,
on average, across the state, eight times
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of water in a dry year compared
to an average year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some counties, 17 to 23 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for some regions, we were seeing 800%
increase in water use in a single growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that equates to about 4 billion
additional gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water being used, just one growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in conclusion, with this giant climate
change blob, there's various things that
[SPEAKER_02]: could happen in New York, including,
when Dave mentioned, the increased
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding with these heavy rainfall events,
but also maybe more short-term summer
[SPEAKER_02]: droughts like the one we saw in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, we're going to have a lot
more variability and uncertainty in our
[SPEAKER_02]: water supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much is coming, when, where,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the ways farmers will adapt to
this is to increase their irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not terribly surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also not just assuming that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that happen in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked to farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told us, A, what they wanted to do,
B, what they did, and C, what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do more of in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to increase agricultural
water use, because, again, even in a
[SPEAKER_02]: normal, average, typical year,
there is a summer water deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be ideal for a farmer to
irrigate if they've already invested in
[SPEAKER_02]: the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a dry, droughty year that could
just maintain their agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have a normal New York summer,
that could actually increase your
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that could also entice farmers
from other regions in the country to come
[SPEAKER_02]: to New York and farm if they see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, in the Midwestern regions
where they have much more long-term,
[SPEAKER_02]: severe droughts and much more limited
water resources, they might be enticed to
[SPEAKER_02]: come to New York and start farming here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just going to keep
increasing this water resource
[SPEAKER_02]: competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just in the agricultural sector,
but also the other competing forces in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial sector or residential sectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that feeds right back into the
loop of increased variability and
[SPEAKER_02]: uncertainty in our water supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll leave you with this thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, given the economic necessity
to use irrigation to maintain yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe even increase productivity,
even in a normal kind of average year in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York State, a lot of the resource
managers across the state need to start
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about climate change,
climate uncertainty, and potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: increased irrigation water use,
which is just going to create more
[SPEAKER_02]: uncertainty in the water supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes for a historically humid
region like New York or anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world or anywhere in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole southeastern United States needs
to start thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the questions that I'm going to
continue to address are, A, how are
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers going to adapt to climate change?
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw some of that with how they adapted
in 2016 with the drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And B, how do we protect our water
resources and agriculture in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: State and keep them both viable?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really important for the economy of New
York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, food and water are two
pretty important things for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, I'll leave you with a
few of our publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a lot of extension publications
come out of just the survey results,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're interested in digging in deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: VegEdge, Scaffolds, and What's Cropping Up
are vegetable, fruit, and field crop
[SPEAKER_02]: extension publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kix, if you don't know about them,
is the Cornell Institute for Climate Smart
[SPEAKER_02]: Solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their briefs are usually geared more
towards policymakers and researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the North Eastern Organic Dairy
Producers Alliance, or association,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember which.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, this is our publication
that we put out in December that goes into
[SPEAKER_02]: much greater detail of everything that I
covered today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also look at how the different
regions throughout New York were impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my email address, if you want
any of this material or have questions
[SPEAKER_02]: about the NatureNet Fellowship or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to leave this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crazy slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a lot of text.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also know that a lot of you are
involved in extension work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're probably interested in not just
how farmers were impacted and maybe what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing, but what do they want?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they want us to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last question we asked on the
survey is, what do you want us to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can NGOs and researchers and
extension agents do to help you cope with
[SPEAKER_02]: and prepare for drought in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one response of what the
farmers want is better long-range
[SPEAKER_02]: forecasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told people that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually got on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people like Toby Alt and Art Zagatano,
who is a co-author on the manuscript,
[SPEAKER_02]: are working on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the number one thing they want to
know more about is drought-resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll leave the slide up that you
can stare at and take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done a little early, but thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about the need for the infrastructure
for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do they use in New York grid
irrigation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grid irrigation will decrease the water
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll repeat that question just in case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't hear us in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was about the amount of drip
irrigation that's used in New York state
[SPEAKER_02]: relative to other types of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And off the top of my head, I don't have
that exact number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have it in the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's actually a large
percentage of irrigation in New York state
[SPEAKER_02]: is drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've talked to irrigation experts at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some say, depending on the crop,
that doesn't always actually save water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously that's going to be better
than flood irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But drip irrigation isn't always the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, a very large percentage of
farmers who are irrigating fruit and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable crops are using drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of the apples and the sandy
soils in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of like strawberries, apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are irrigating in high tunnels,
you're probably using drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some use overhead sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say some of the really large maybe
cabbage farmers and potato farmers are
[SPEAKER_02]: using center pivots and larger sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a good portion of drip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're suggesting like if it looks
like we're really going to start putting
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure on water resources, making sure
farmers are aware of drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drip irrigation is not only water,
it's also nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fertilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are some of the things that we
need to start helping if farmers are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to invest in irrigation infrastructure
that we need to help them think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of farmers said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to know like, how do I save
water?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of irrigation should I be using
for different crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things they did want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's not us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume that your irrigation water is
coming from wells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are using ponds,
on-farm ponds or streams.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good number of farms have streams
running through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are somewhat seasonal and
perennial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they may not always be
flowing and especially in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, a lot of farmers just pump right
out of creeks of streams that sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: are fed by springs so they don't dry up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say it was pretty,
I actually have in some of the survey
[SPEAKER_02]: results a figure that shows what portion
of the different types of irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment and the types of water sources
the farmers are using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly, about 15% said they're using
city water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're paying dearly for water to
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had one farmer who has an apple
orchard said he used about 10 million
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of city water in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: He normally uses three million gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a million throughout the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to follow up on what Tom was just
asking about, for those farmers who are
[SPEAKER_06]: using wells, did you also detect a decline
in the quality of water as a result of the
[SPEAKER_06]: drought?
[SPEAKER_06]: It sure was up, increased salinity,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't actually ask them about the
quality of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would presume, yeah, whatever water
source you're using as you're getting less
[SPEAKER_02]: and less, even ponds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality would decrease, wells,
whatnot, with the exception of probably
[SPEAKER_02]: city water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't ask that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be an interesting follow-up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everyone in Geneva hearing the
questions being asked, or should I repeat
[SPEAKER_02]: them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, we can hear it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_07]: In your own research, what approaches or
adaptations do you find have the most
[SPEAKER_07]: promise for recommending to farmers going
forward in this kind of broad?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know, what are you most
excited about in terms of adaptations in
[SPEAKER_07]: your research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dave is currently working on the New
York State Soil Health Initiative along
[SPEAKER_02]: with Cedric and a handful of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the beauty of increasing your organic
matter on your farm and your soil is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it makes you resilient against not just
drought, but also these heavy rainfall
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it increases, it can improve
productivity and just make your soils
[SPEAKER_02]: healthier for the plants, less fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It traps greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's protecting our water and reducing
climate change mitigation and also helping
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer to be more resilient to
potential climate change implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would say improving soil health
is a pretty easy way to deal with these
[SPEAKER_02]: things for farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's a little bit longer term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, buying irrigation equipment
is going to help you the very next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil health takes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, for the long term, I would say
improving soil health is a great
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, thinking about irrigation
infrastructure to protect yourself against
[SPEAKER_02]: drought.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you mentioned early on about some
farmers that were using 3 million or 10
[SPEAKER_06]: million gallons.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the reporting requirements for
water that farmers might pump on their own
[SPEAKER_06]: land?
[SPEAKER_06]: And is there a fee or a tax that's paid to
the counties?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that their water to pump?
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of water rights, I don't know
anything about how this works in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I went to a really cool water
conference in West Virginia a while ago
[SPEAKER_02]: and saw an amazing presentation by a water
rights lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said basically, to sum it up,
the eastern seawater, all the northeast,
[SPEAKER_02]: southeast, we are the wild, wild west when
it comes to water use resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the west, every drop is accounted for.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the east, it's really there are no
water rights yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's on your own property, you pretty
much own it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really regulated if it's your own
pond.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those giant ponds could be stopping
water from getting to other water
[SPEAKER_02]: resources, streams.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says cheaper county water for
agricultural use.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are there any county-provided
water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the people who are using city
water, that is accounted for.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have meters recording every drop of
that water being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if it's your on-farm water use
and not city water use, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: technically have to report it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're using over 100,000 gallons
a day, they are supposed to report it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's fairly unregulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just how it's always been.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we do see more of these droughts in
the future, that might not be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we need to start thinking about
tapping into other water resources for
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any potential of rainwater
harvesting during the rainy season?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you repeat that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any potential of rainwater
harvesting during the rainy season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so yeah, that's something we've
thought about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in the southeastern United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is basically saving the
water, catching the water during the rainy
[SPEAKER_02]: season and reusing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, we have these heavy
rainfall events in the springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rather than just let all of that run
off and affect potentially water quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: can farmers keep that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is definitely one thing maybe
more ditch systems and ponds on your farm
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're experimenting with in the
southeastern United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be interesting to try that
out in New York too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dave and I have talked about that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it could work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of investment for a farmer,
though, to put in all of that
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're also taking land out of
production if you're building a five acre
[SPEAKER_02]: pond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but that would definitely be,
if we do start seeing more droughts in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future, one potential way to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone in Geneva have questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, could I ask a question from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you hear it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so yeah, I'm interested in the organic
soil because that's new for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know organic soil is good in severe
climate like the drought weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but what's the percentage of organic
soil in America, especially in the western
[SPEAKER_03]: New York state?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, I might have to field that question
to Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, what is the
percentage of organic matter in soil sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of in the entire country, but also New
York maybe relative to the entire country?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it depends on the soil type.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sandy soils have very low potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only so much you can build up
organic matter in sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they might be 1% or 2% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of our typical soils,
long soils, might be 3% to 5%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And farmers can build that up some higher
than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The higher it is, the better it is for
water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we actually have a few pockets of
truly what we call muck soils here,
[SPEAKER_06]: which are really just peat soils,
almost like super high organic matter
[SPEAKER_06]: where a few crops and some of the sods,
some kind of ranges.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the big target for most of the
acres is now kind of loam soil where I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean, anywhere from.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put organic soil might be as low as
2% to 4% or 5% and try to build that up
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep it high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another question here from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you showed the data that there is a
deficit and precipitation during the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer from the evapotranspiration,
I know that when you're doing the water
[SPEAKER_00]: balance for that sort of thing,
you can calculate how much is coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: underground water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of course, plants are not dying
every time during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take a look at how during that
specific season because the drought was so
[SPEAKER_00]: severe, how much water was taken out of
the water table and if the following
[SPEAKER_00]: season that was replenished or the best
sort of calculation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't actually, I didn't do any
real field work aside from being in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fields talking to farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't measuring actual soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pretty sure there is that kind of
data available online, probably through
[SPEAKER_02]: NOAA or USGS where you can look at soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just operating under the assumption
that given all the snow and rain that we
[SPEAKER_02]: had in 2017, that probably the water table
came back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a pretty short term drought,
not a long term drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is going to be water in the soil
even during that summer water deficit
[SPEAKER_02]: period that plants will have available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of springs and aquifers
that also help farmers, even if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have precipitation, helping to compensate
for the evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I did not collect the soil
moisture data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say based on those yield declines,
I mean, the soils were growing pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, we did in 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so lucky to have two such different
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did survey farmers and ask them about
how the heavy rainfall events and flooding
[SPEAKER_02]: impacted their farms and their yields and
so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have some of that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we didn't have quite as
great as a response rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably not peer reviewed journal
publishable, but perhaps in some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: extension publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep your eyes out for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I couldn't answer that question
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I would say the soil was really
dry in 2016 and it probably wasn't as dry
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2017.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the hydrologist here, Todd Walter,
I think those guys did track.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tracked that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that says growing season of 2017,
the stream flows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had come back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if we had had another low snowpack
year, it probably would have been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: damaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year's been a low snowpack year,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you seeing farmers reporting issues
with the invasive earthworms and drought
[SPEAKER_08]: related to that at all?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if farmers are experiencing
it, but I know a lot of homeowners and
[SPEAKER_08]: gardens are seeing increased basically
drought because of loss of water retention
[SPEAKER_08]: due to disturbed soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so yeah, I don't even, this is new to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these invasive worms are more prevalent
during drought, is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're here now and they're getting
worse in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what their pattern is across
our state though, but they're disturbing
[SPEAKER_08]: soils in cultivated areas and woodlands
also in a way that basically the soil just
[SPEAKER_08]: becomes worm castings and it's really hard
to keep moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if it's affecting farmers
at all or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard anything about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wondered if it came up at all
during the drought that it was even harder
[SPEAKER_08]: to keep moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I didn't have farmers tell me
anything about the worms, but.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, home gardens where you get to
the point where there can be so much worm
[SPEAKER_06]: activity and so many worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've hardly ever seen a commercial farm
where there's that much worm activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're probably talking about Lumbricus
terrestris, which is part of, by the
[SPEAKER_06]: Europeans in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called an invasive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been here the common earthworm for
a couple hundred years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to deal with so many other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably bottom of their list.
[SPEAKER_06]: For woodlands, you know, it's a bigger
issue because the nutrient cycling can be
[SPEAKER_06]: so fast with those kind of worms that the
trees are growing slowly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like an annual row crop where
there's a lot of fast growing plants and
[SPEAKER_06]: plants need a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the worms are doing so much activity
that the nutrients get released by the
[SPEAKER_06]: earthworm activity before the trees can
actually capture it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and also the castings, as Emily was
saying, tend to be hydrophobic and what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're doing is greatly reducing the
organic matter in the whole layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just another thing to deal with,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess with that, it's almost 1 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had another really quick question,
I could field that or we can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any, I know there's organizations
out there that do this, but anyone out
[SPEAKER_06]: there that's educating farmers on some of
the information you've come up with,
[SPEAKER_06]: like say, instead of investing so much
into irrigation equipment, maybe more soil
[SPEAKER_06]: modification and control, it's a cheaper,
maybe a bit longer term process,
[SPEAKER_06]: but is there anybody educating farmers on
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there can't be too much organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There can't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, you want to find that balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is limits, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be too much,
but education is the only way that not
[SPEAKER_06]: every farmer has $6 million to buy new
irrigation equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously Cornell Cooperative Extension
is an incredible source of education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Soil Health Initiative that Dave
and his team and Cedric are working on is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely geared towards, right now
they're doing a little bit more research
[SPEAKER_02]: and surveying, but the ultimate plan is to
have a website and handouts and
[SPEAKER_02]: information and education for farmers on
how to help improve soil health and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Kix, right, the Cornell Institute
for the Climate Smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess there's a lot of them out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was more referring to what you
specifically done recently with this
[SPEAKER_06]: drought information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we do have a plan to relay this
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these publications, Veg Edge,
is read by vegetable farmers across all of
[SPEAKER_02]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a publication for vegetable farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the Fruit Journal and What's
Cropping Up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all read.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's read by the actual farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it does give, it's mostly talking
about the survey results, but it does give
[SPEAKER_02]: some ideas of what all of the different
farmers wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you obviously have those resources
that farmers can follow up with that are
[SPEAKER_02]: listed in those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shannon, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
