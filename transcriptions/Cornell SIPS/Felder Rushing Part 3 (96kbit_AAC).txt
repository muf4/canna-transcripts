[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your own food, if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't support, if you can't grow a
lot of your own, go to farmers markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought, with me on this trip,
homemade fig preserves, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all don't know, if anybody ever eat fig
preserves, a bunch of Yankees,
[SPEAKER_01]: y'all don't know anything, and y'all eat
rhubarb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhubarb eaters, I'm surrounded by rhubarb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figs grow well with no care at all in the
South.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made these figs, my children helped me
pick figs two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made fig preserves from their great,
great grandmother's fig tree, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids know about climbing in it,
they know about picking, they know about
[SPEAKER_01]: sorting them out, getting the bad ones
out, cutting the stems off, all those
[SPEAKER_01]: details, making figs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the revolution comes, my wife,
who's a hotshot lawyer, she says that
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyers can be among the first to be lined
up and shot, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But people who can grow food will be
spared, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my kids know that, they've been to
Vermont, and they know that they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: Vermont maple syrup in every pigly wiggly,
y'all know what pigly wiggly is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every pigly wiggly in Mississippi has
Vermont maple syrup, but you got to know
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody to get homemade fig preserves,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is slow food, but it's also slow
gardening, because you're enjoying things,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we want to have something sweet to eat
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I brought a case of this,
and a friend of mine over in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_01]: swapped me out, some strawberry rhubarb
preserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he playing a joke on me?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to hurt to eat it,
is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what slow gardening is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a real quick rundown,
I've got a list of a few things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that, you already do these things,
but you don't think about them,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think about sharing with others,
you don't think about talking with
[SPEAKER_01]: children in that garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some fantastic children's gardens
all over, the New England, all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: country, but all you have to do is bend
down and wiggle your finger in the grass
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk about whatever you find with the
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky, it'll be a roly-poly,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you'll just talk to the child for a
little while and engage them, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: change that child's attitude about not
only the world, but maybe about grownups,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what slow gardening is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what it is, just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's non-commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't keep track of who goes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on the thing called Slow Gardening,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And see if it's not things that you
already do that maybe you just haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my job here today, just get us
relaxed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to throw out one last thing before
we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bottle tree, anybody have a bottle
tree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a bottle tree?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't get it, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where you take an old tree that died
and you stick bottles on the branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's been to Sissinghurst, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you go up the tower about
halfway up, they got that window with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the glass in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the wintertime, particularly people up
north, have colorful glass bottles in your
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason you do that is because in
the wintertime, your pineal gland,
[SPEAKER_01]: that thing that affects your attitude,
shrinks up, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what they call seasonal affective
disorder, the blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put a little colorful glass in the
window and it stimulates you a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: it sparks you up, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, bottle trees are just taken out of
the yard, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, some people don't like bottle
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: My way of thinking, if you think it's okay
to hang stuff out of holes in your ears,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can shut up about my bottle tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to have a little fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local artists do this and it's supposed to
be swirly, throwing, organic and swirly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an artistic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these car tags, what do y'all call
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them car tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licensed plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get me out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in mind, St. Madison County on the
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not from Madison County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Madison, I'm in a little artsy-fartsy
community and Madison County is the gated
[SPEAKER_01]: community county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do this with all Madison County
because it honks them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say it honks them off, you know
what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, so I'm being even a little expressive
in a mean way with this kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when I'm riding down the road,
when I hear my wind chimes going,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I smell rosemary waffling around the
cab, when I can check my rain gaze,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if I want to carry watermelons in the
bathroom, in the back of it, to my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Roger swinging over to answer,
you know, that's what I think I'm trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call this my truck truck and all I'm
trying to do is have a little fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I blown it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You never get invited back, so let's just
blow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, whose poodle is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep clipping and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do y'all have trouble with people who
prune trucks poorly?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what pollardy is when you cut
them back little balls?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that good or bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who says it's good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who says it's bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shrub doesn't care if it's been
pollarded any more than that poodle cares
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's been pruned into a tumor shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say you shouldn't do that
stuff because it's not natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks, neither is plucking eyebrows,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different ways of looking at
stuff, and all I'm trying to do here today
[SPEAKER_01]: is say, you know, it's okay to lighten up
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martha Stewart quoted me by name.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I was on a radio program.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said something about how I look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, look, Martha, I look like a bubba,
I sound like a bubba, I drive a bubba
[SPEAKER_01]: pickup truck, but I'm no more of a bubba
than you are a stereotypical blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't hang up on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What she quoted me as saying, it doesn't
matter what you do or how you do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: your neighbors are going to talk about you
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go forth and have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tellyourrushing.net, not dot com dot net
for net work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see some cheesy stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Addie, and my colleague Pat and
I are working on Min's garden and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of other gardens around campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd like to invite the Cornell
community, those that are not part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, but are here after the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every Wednesday, we have Weeding
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We meet in the manned courtyard at noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give out free ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go around to all the different
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do weeding, and we talk about,
you know, the different blooms.
That's what we do.
That's what we do.
That's what we do.
