[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to teaching, Bob has an
extension appointment in the landscape
[SPEAKER_05]: nursery and urban forestry program,
and his role there is to provide accurate
[SPEAKER_05]: and timely diagnostics of insect pests.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also makes recommendations for pest
control and writes about current trends in
[SPEAKER_05]: pest identification and management.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he also acts to overall resources for
the green industry in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very happy to have you,
Bob, and hopefully you are right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will begin, correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the newbies here, as you can
probably tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, everyone, and thanks for
listening in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: My task today is to talk to you about
winter moth, which was a new pest for us
[SPEAKER_01]: in Massachusetts for about the last eight
or nine years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it popped up quite unexpectedly in the
landscape areas and the nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was after a couple of years that we
realized it was becoming a big problem in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a number of growers in southeastern
Massachusetts that experienced such damage
[SPEAKER_01]: from this insect that they had virtually
no crops for two, three years in a row
[SPEAKER_01]: until we were able to get a handle on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to explain to you our
experience and what perhaps you can do to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on the lookout for this monitoring and
management techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2000, 2001 in Plymouth County,
Massachusetts, southeastern Mass,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had an outbreak of this little insect
called fall canker worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a native inch worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And periodically, it can go into outbreak
phase, and it can be a problem for two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three years until natural controls catch
up to it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then usually, the way that that story
goes is that the insect is then knocked
[SPEAKER_01]: down into very small population numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't see it for quite a while,
maybe 10, 15, or 20 years in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And population started to build up fall
canker worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little green looper, as hopefully
you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a distinguishing feature in that
loopers or inch worms only have two to
[SPEAKER_01]: three pairs of prolegs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to try to use the pointer,
which are the abdominal legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The abdominal legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fall canker worm, the first pair of
their prolegs are very short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's said that it's a half a pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very distinguishing feature of fall
canker worm is that it has two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: pairs of prolegs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually green.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the population numbers go into high
density mode, the caterpillars turn very
[SPEAKER_01]: dark black with light colored stripes on
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two caterpillars that you are
looking at now, both fall canker worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were both collected at the exact same
time on the same branch on an oak tree in
[SPEAKER_01]: southeastern Mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The population was in a phase change going
to the dark color.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually, they're green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we had occurring in
southeastern Mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura, I have a screen that popped up that
I want to get rid of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after two or three years, the
population of fall canker worm building
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically, Deborah Swanson,
our extension specialist in southeastern
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass, called me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, the problem's getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I told you in the
beginning it was probably going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: worse for a few years till nature caught
up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she started saying, you know,
I'm not so convinced it's fall canker worm
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had these other little green inch
worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she sent some to me here in Amherst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I immediately realized it was not fall
canker worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still had some fall canker worm in that
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly, we had these little green
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a while trying to identify it and
was pretty convinced it was not a native
[SPEAKER_01]: insect here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved on to Jeff Bettner in our
department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was unable to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Joe Elkinton, our forest
entomologist, who sent it to Rick Hobeck
[SPEAKER_01]: at Cornell and also David Wagner at UConn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of them came back almost the same
day and said, you have winter moth,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is native to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been known to be in Nova Scotia
since the late 1940s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be problematic, this little
geometric looper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly, we had a new exotic here in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, this is a little video
just to show you that it just is an
[SPEAKER_01]: innocuous looking little green inch worm
or looper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't believe we're going to get
this quick time to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will just move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall canker worm has a pretty wide host
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: This native caterpillar is found on oaks
and maples, birches, crab apples,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a number of other deciduous hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We primarily see it as a problem in oak
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oaks and maples, winter moth shares many
of the same host plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, too, is a generalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: In England, in Northern England,
Scotland, it's a problem with Sitka spruce
[SPEAKER_01]: and heather.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly, it feeds on deciduous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that I've listed apple and
blueberry as being potential hosts for
[SPEAKER_01]: winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did winter moth come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, we did not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know now, thanks to the work of Joe
Elkinton.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear me mention Joe Elkinton quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, as far as I know, has the only active
winter moth research program going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the eastern part of North America right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he has done some very interesting
work, and I will pass some of that along
[SPEAKER_01]: to you in this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The insect is native to Europe,
including England.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was found in Nova Scotia, as I
mentioned, in 1949, mostly in apples and
[SPEAKER_01]: oak.
[SPEAKER_01]: It popped up in British Columbia in 1976,
several thousand miles from Nova Scotia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we believe it was moved there
accidentally, perhaps on nursery stock or
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other finds have been in Washington State
and Oregon, and these have been in
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In British Columbia, it's more of a
deciduous tree problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, it's very well established in
Eastern Massachusetts and most of Rhode
[SPEAKER_01]: Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be moved, as I mentioned,
with plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the caterpillars are through feeding,
they spin down on a silken web to the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, burrow in an inch or less,
and pupate almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if plants are dug and balled and
burrowed after containerized or moved,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the insect could very well move with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter moth has probably been in
Massachusetts much longer than we realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in low numbers, I'm sure,
for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is remarkably similar in a number
of ways to our native fall canker worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They share many of the host plants,
as we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The adult female moths are wingless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're similar to fall canker worm,
and I'll show you pictures of that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: few moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The adult moths are active at the same
time as fall canker worm, which happens to
[SPEAKER_01]: be around Thanksgiving time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And winter moth, being a new introduction,
has very limited natural controls here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's winter moth on the left and fall
canker worm on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their eggs, the female winter moth
deposits her eggs rather loosely on
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate, usually it's the tree trunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fall canker worm lays its eggs in
clusters, these little barrel-shaped eggs
[SPEAKER_01]: usually packed together on stems or tree
trunks primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: The area that's enclosed in the red line
is pretty much where we're having a severe
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with winter moth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work, and the slide looks a little
busy here, but I'm just going to highlight
[SPEAKER_01]: what I think are some of the important
parts for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magenta color is where winter moth has
been picked up in pheromone traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Elkinton's lab, Jeff Bettner works
with Joe Elkinton, had been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: extensive survey work throughout the
Northeast and cooperating with other
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers in different parts of the
world to try to get a handle on winter
[SPEAKER_01]: moth and DNA and relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's thought now that our winter moth
population here in Massachusetts is from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Nova Scotia population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its DNA matches most closely to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in coastal Nova Scotia,
the magenta dots and then coming down
[SPEAKER_01]: through Maine and New Hampshire and then
the cluster of it into Massachusetts and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine and New Hampshire are unaware that
they have winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were until Joe Elkinton had done
this work and picked them up in traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the population levels are so low,
they've never been problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom map has DNA and genitalia and a
lot of things we don't need to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the magenta represents the
known areas of winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe has been looking at the potential
for a connection between cold hardiness
[SPEAKER_01]: and winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that it's coastal Nova
Scotia, coastal Maine, coastal
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, all in that
zone 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zone 6A slash 5B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite possible that winter moth
may never venture into the zone 5 or
[SPEAKER_01]: colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that Joe will
continue to research to see if he can have
[SPEAKER_01]: more of an understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible winter moth may just stay
coastal and continue to move southward for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe not westward and northward in
New England.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture is from an organic apple
orchard on Cape Cod taken several years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the defoliation you're looking at here
in early June was from winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a very voracious feeder of
foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The life cycle of winter moth that hatches
very early in the spring here in eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass, it would be approximately mid-April.
[SPEAKER_01]: This last year, I think it was April 16th,
we saw the first hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere around 20 to 50 growing
degree days, roughly, or base 50 for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fairly early.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves have not emerged at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the winter moth really wants to find
are buds that are just beginning to swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wriggle into those buds and feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can cause great damage within
those buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been some research done in years
past that shows that established winter
[SPEAKER_01]: moth populations time their hatch with
that of the phenology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're in an oak stand,
oaks tend to break bud later than,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not emerge for a week,
10 days or more later than they would in a
[SPEAKER_01]: maple stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the buds open, the larvae become free
feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be managed like any free
feeding lepidopter caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we have a lot of caterpillars in a
bud, if we have a cool season where bud
[SPEAKER_01]: break is delayed, then those caterpillars
can create quite a bit of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buds may never open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They consume both foliar and flower buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem for the blueberry
growers is that the larvae will eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive parts of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no flowers, no fruit, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feed for five or six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then late May, usually that last week
in May, sometimes into early June if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: having a cool season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they spin down to the soil and
pupate where they stay until about
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving time and then emerge as adult
moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eggs in the upper left corner are
scattered loosely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're white at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn sort of a pinkish color.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the embryo matures, they become a
deeper red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just before hatching, they become this
beautiful deep blue color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell if they're close to
hatching when they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do achieve that coloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larvae hatch, seek out swelling buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the buds are not swollen, the larvae
may spin silk and balloon in their hope to
[SPEAKER_01]: land on a plant that does have buds and
suitable phenology for them to enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed for five weeks, drop to the soil,
and then the adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture was just taken a couple of
weeks ago in Southeastern Mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are two female winter moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those little white spots on this
structure are their eggs, very freshly
[SPEAKER_01]: laid eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will lay their eggs on anything if
they have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a piece of lichen about an inch in
length.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see just the little red eggs
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a first instar winter moth
caterpillar's dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are just starting to swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wriggle in through the bud scales
to get to the center of the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: start feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2003, Deborah Swanson and I talked to
Joe Elkinton about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he deemed it important enough to go
take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dominic Marini, who's pictured here in the
middle, was an extension specialist in
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeastern Mass since retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has a small farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was having a terrible time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly it was blueberries with winter
moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are peeling buds, looking for
the little winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you peel the buds, when they're in this
stage, they are very tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture shows here from a,
thank you, from a, I believe this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: Norway maple bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see at the bottom,
the head capsule and the three pairs of
[SPEAKER_01]: legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's less than a millimeter in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deborah Swanson refers to this as looking
like a little eyelash when you peel open
[SPEAKER_01]: that bud in the spring and the pristine
pale green tissue in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden there are these little
things in there, little lines that just
[SPEAKER_01]: look like they don't belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's a winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very important stage for
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larvae will chew holes in the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the bud continues to expand,
or the leaves continue to expand from the
[SPEAKER_01]: bud, those holes become more exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larvae are still there and continue to
be free feeders and to create more injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Norway maple bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see two larvae in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a penny that's at the bottom of
that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're starting to become free
feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will completely defoliate their
host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work again was done by Joe Elkinton,
taking samples and going to six different
[SPEAKER_01]: towns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dark red line for Falmouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Falmouth is on Cape Cod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really didn't start seeing winter
moth out there 2005 or 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's pretty well established.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see how the numbers can vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there can be upwards to seven,
eight, or nine within one bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: which of course can be extremely damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the damage from winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the female moth emerges, she seeks a
vertical sew at a tree trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she'll race toward it, race up the
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: She emits a pheromone, tracks the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're seeing here are these
clouds of male moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we've been experiencing
in eastern Massachusetts for the past two
[SPEAKER_01]: to three weeks now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been getting many, many reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's looking like this next season is
going to be a very heavy winter moth
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillar season for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pheromone has been identified and
synthesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are traps that Joe Elkinton uses
to monitor for this insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It attracts the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The female is at the top as she races up
the tree, emitting pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males are attracted to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes she's still racing up the tree,
dragging the male along with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that process is through,
she'll begin laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of moths that are
flying around Thanksgiving time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to be small and drab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't give us a lot of
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fall canker worm, which we started
out talking about, the male moth has a
[SPEAKER_01]: little white patch on its wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The winter moth does not have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male winter moth has a band of marks
near the posterior end.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wings are like little hash marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce spanworm on the right is a native
insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the same genus as winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's native here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is not problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get these at my porch light around
Thanksgiving time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a dark band that's highlighted
here, a little mark on the vein that
[SPEAKER_01]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once these moths have been active for two
or three days, they lose a lot of their
skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this becomes very difficult to
discern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll move on for the sake of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter moth females are said to be
wingless.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see in the center picture,
the better picture, they do have these
[SPEAKER_01]: very stubby wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fall canker worm is completely
wingless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the little remnants of the winter
moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Female wings where fall canker worms are
completely wingless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert, give it a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have had a little challenges
here, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to prepare some poll
questions for our next speaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's just give it a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one question from Dan Miller.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's wondering, what is the timing of
maple versus oak versus blueberry budding?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how would that affect the amount of
winter moths that might be out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's something that's not
really well understood at this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially here in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know if I have an answer for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't specifically work with
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't say for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mostly follow growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we like to know before they're active
and trying to wriggle into buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that can be an important timing
for managing them, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries, where it's essential to
manage them before they enter the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tree banding for the adult females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jo Alcontemple has had a number of years
now of study where he takes these bands
[SPEAKER_01]: that have the fiber batting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wrapped tightly around the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the female runs up the tree,
she encounters this white bat and can't
[SPEAKER_01]: crawl under it, tries to go out around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, it's rather thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's this film around that band
that hangs under the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fiber band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is sticky on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the female tries to get up around
the cottony band or the fibers band,
[SPEAKER_01]: she hits the stickum and is stuck there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great way of sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are two bands on this tree to
see if any were able to get past the first
[SPEAKER_01]: band.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why that's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, I'm able to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Laura, you're not able to advance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let me know what I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Jeff Bettner with two bands from
one tree that I think you can probably see
[SPEAKER_01]: are loaded with moths.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you could advance the slide for me,
Laura, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to have you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not responding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'd advance again, there are
males and females on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the bottom of this band now,
on the bottom left, you can see there's
[SPEAKER_01]: all this red stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you would advance that for me,
we'll see a close up that even though the
[SPEAKER_01]: females were stuck there, they continued
to just spew out eggs, thousands and
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each female produces about 150 eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those two bands that Jeff is holding
both filled up within an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first band filled up so much that the
new moths were able to run over the stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies on the first band and get up to the
second band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'd advance for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is some of the work that Jeff has
been doing for the past several years on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, the population since
2005 of Wintermont in three towns has been
[SPEAKER_01]: going downward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in 2008, it started going up
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some moderating factor to
population size that's not understood yet
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Massachusetts what the natural or
environmental causes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, we're expecting a banner
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, Joe's data only goes to
November 27th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was some significant activity
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some quick numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very high density.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2004, he was getting 1,000 to 1,600
female moths per tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far this year in some towns,
Hanson Mass, he's captured 900 females in
[SPEAKER_01]: just four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can be looking at 150 plus thousand
eggs per tree with these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: population densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we going to manage this insect?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to monitor first presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to know it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to be familiar with all of the
life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, can you advance for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moths are very obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eggs can be difficult once we get into
late winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time we see free-feeding
caterpillars, it may be too late,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if it's a high density year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: For blueberry growers, we've been
recommending a horticultural oil spray for
[SPEAKER_01]: the overwintering eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the growers have been adding a
chemical within the spray tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they try to time their spray just
before hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the oil doesn't cover all of the
eggs, and it probably won't, that the
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars that are successful in
hatching from eggs, the chemical companion
[SPEAKER_01]: which might be an organophosphate or a
pyrethroid, whatever is labeled for
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries and mixes with oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps even spinosad.
[SPEAKER_01]: BT works, but it will not work when the
larvae are inside of the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a lot of damage can
occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes significant damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spinosad products for trees and shrubs,
it's conserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the commercial version.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of homeowner versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And TRUST is an organic version or label
for spinosad products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works remarkably well on all
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have to be free feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tebufenazide is confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it has labeling for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily for lepidoptera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then chemical insecticides such as the
pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, once they're free feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the primary factor that's being looked
at are parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nova Scotia had remarkable success with
using these parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are now the controlling factor of
winter moth in Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter moth is hard to find in Nova
Scotia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, I need for you to advance for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyzenus albicans is a tachinid fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only known.
[SPEAKER_01]: A host is winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agrapon is an ipnumonid wasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a generalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be here already.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the work here is being done with
Cyzenus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you advance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Nova Scotia, again, I got this slide
from Joe Elkinton.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that in 54, they started
releases of both of these parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they got into 1962 and 63,
winter moth populations were extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the controlling factor, again,
is this fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mass reared and released it over
eight or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got very good successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fly seeks out winter moth
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using the olfactory cues, it picks up
on where winter moth is feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, can you advance for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lays its eggs on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are three eggs highly magnified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tiny dot is an egg of the Cyzenus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the winter moth caterpillar feeds,
it ingests the egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the egg is in the gut of the
caterpillar, it will hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fly maggot continues to
consume and kill the winter moth
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are six sites now where Joe
Elkinton has released Cyzenus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has been able to retrieve some in
following years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very low numbers so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But his goal is to continue mass rearing
these and to continue releasing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, I have a bit more to go,
but I'm concerned about time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to cut into Roger's time.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd advance for me, just tell me when
I'm finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've covered this, so you may continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our website, UMass Green Info.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is on the handout that is posted here
at this website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to read more about winter
moth and learn some resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Joe Elkinton is doing primary
research here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a comment about that, Bob.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I stated at the beginning, I don't work
with blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incidentally, I wound up working with some
of the blueberry growers trying to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them with this winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But virtually all of my work with winter
moth has been with it feeding on deciduous
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if Sonya Schloman is still
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw she was earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she may have some input for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn on your microphone for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just give me a little checkmark or
something if you'd like to comment through
[SPEAKER_05]: the audio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, if you could type something in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a couple of other questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anyone looking for the winter moth in
the lakes regions of New York State?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even in Eastern New York, which I'm
somewhat concerned about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not been looking for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you know, Bob, if there's any
larger regional scouting going on for this
[SPEAKER_05]: pest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know that the pheromone trapping
was pretty widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it was mostly done in areas
where it was suspected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also where it's established,
you know, in other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was picked up in two sites in Long
Island for the past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the extension people there
were completely unaware that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still, if it wasn't for the trapping,
they wouldn't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in very, very low numbers there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pam Gianetti has a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If females... No, I don't know if anything
is being done in the lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They emerge over a fairly lengthy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can start about the week before
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can go into January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it's possible that you could
spray pyrethroids at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, a knock-down type spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather... You know, we have freezing
nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how conducive it would be
to... Those conditions are for using
[SPEAKER_01]: products like that at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it depends on where you're... What
surrounds your blueberry fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have forested areas,
especially if you have maples or oaks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may be successful at treating what is
on your blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may have blow-in, ballooning,
drop-down from the surrounding trees once
[SPEAKER_01]: they hatch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very frustrating pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking a lot to the blueberry
growers in Southeastern Mass for two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three years when this was so problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom line is that it's very
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be on it daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when they're hatching,
or about to hatch, and just stay after it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monitor the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they're getting into the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that is really the crucial time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the buds open, you know, if we don't
have a big problem, but once the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: open, we can treat them like we would any
other lepidopter caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite easy to manage them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one other question from Jeff
Miller.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the timing for the release of
predators?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's actually a parasitoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's released a week or so before the
winter moth caterpillar is going to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding and drop to pupate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fairly mature caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here it would be about the third week
in May.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I should have said parasitoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the last week in May.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other question from Carl is,
are there bird species or any other
[SPEAKER_05]: natural predator that feed on the winter
moth?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do see different birds in trees or
bushes picking away at winter moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's once the foliage has opened and
they're obvious and free feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't seem to make a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The population numbers become excessive
and very, very damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the points I wanted to make is that
we have had consecutive years of winter
[SPEAKER_01]: moth and southeastern mass on the oaks and
the maples primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have just thousands and thousands
of dead trees now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trees were so weakened that they
succumbed to other secondary factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've become a huge liability for
the utility companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these dead trees threaten the power
lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can attest to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having been in New England this
Thanksgiving and over the summer,
[SPEAKER_05]: it really is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to cut off questions now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be able to get to some of them
after Dr. Williams' presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Childs, thank you so much for telling
us about this pest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'd like to introduce our next
speaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to apologize to all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Williams had some poll questions for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for some reason, the polls are not
working today.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pods won't open up properly for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have to bypass that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to introduce Dr. Roger
Williams, who is from the Ohio State
[SPEAKER_05]: University.
[SPEAKER_05]: His focus of his research is to develop
better insect management practices for the
[SPEAKER_05]: small fruit growers in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's been involved in developing IPM
techniques through the employment of
[SPEAKER_05]: biorationals, attractants, and biocontrol
measures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Presently, he's studying the efficacy of
various nematodes to control grape root
[SPEAKER_05]: borer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also investigating the use of
parasitic nematodes in the management of
[SPEAKER_05]: the raspberry crown borer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But today, he's going to be talking to us
about managing Japanese beetles and
[SPEAKER_05]: different strategies for that pest,
which is a serious pest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dr. Williams, I do want to let you
know that you have the full half hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't get cut off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can have a little bit of
question and answer at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for joining us.
OK,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And welcome to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in Ohio, we've kind of missed the
storm so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hidden this way, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, our roads are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the small fruit entomologist from here
in northern Ohio, connected with Ohio
[SPEAKER_03]: State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it OARDC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I work primarily with grapes,
blueberries, brambles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, as you will see on the slides,
we do have very serious problems with
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese beetles in Ohio and also in the
neighboring states.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most problematic pests
that we will see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the reasons is that it attacks
so many different crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another reason probably is that so
many people know what the Japanese beetle
[SPEAKER_03]: is, because they've seen it in their yards
eating on a lot of different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also work with a Japanese beetle problem
that we have in the Azores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has been going on since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it originally came in there at the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Air Force base that we have in the Azores
on Tercero Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're pretty sure that we're going to
be the guilty ones of bringing it in there
[SPEAKER_03]: on some of our jet planes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's all over the Azores on the
nine different islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Azores are about three quarters of
the way over from between New Jersey and
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you get yours to advance?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is your slide set advancing?
[SPEAKER_03]: As most of you know, the Japanese beetle
arrived here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: sometime between 1910 and 1916.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was first really discovered in 1916,
I guess, in southern New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thus the first Japanese beetle
laboratory was established there in New
[SPEAKER_03]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the Japanese beetle moved west,
the USDA Japanese beetle lab moved here to
[SPEAKER_03]: Worcester, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's still mostly here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go by a different name, but still
there's several people here that work with
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is still on the move, and it's moved
north up into Michigan over the last few
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a terrible pest of blueberries and
other small fruits in Ohio and surrounding
[SPEAKER_03]: states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan leads the nation in production of
high bush blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure that this is the most recent
data, but because I know Georgia has
[SPEAKER_03]: planted an awful lot of blueberries with
the help of Michigan companies and
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the time this was published,
they had about 40% of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, financial security of the
Michigan berry industry was threatened by
[SPEAKER_03]: the recent invasion of the Japanese
beetle, which happened something like 10
[SPEAKER_03]: or 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's now into the major centers where
the commercial blueberries are raised
[SPEAKER_03]: there in Michigan, not too far off of Lake
Michigan there on that side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they produce a lot of fresh fruit,
and some of it's even exported and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've tried a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the Japanese beetles to keep them
down, but they have trouble with residues,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they keep working on better systems to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much of the Michigan crop is harvested
mechanically, and this has led to some
[SPEAKER_03]: unique problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is that it, of course,
skeletonizes the leaves like it does on
[SPEAKER_03]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And makes the fruit unsalable,
where it bites off the skin and leaves the
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit, white fruit, exposed there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another problem is, and this is one that I
had a hard time believing, was that
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese beetles were getting inside of
the berries, and they couldn't be found on
[SPEAKER_03]: the conveyor belts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did everything from changing the
color of the conveyor belts to changing
[SPEAKER_03]: the lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lights overhead, and still they had
difficulties with that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why do the berries go inside of the
beetles, inside of the berries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody seems to know that here in Ohio
because we don't mechanically harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I kind of doubted it when I
first heard it, but then I was invited
[SPEAKER_03]: over to really see it at one of the
processing companies nearby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is that the berries are
mechanically harvested and then
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately taken into the cold storage
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when they're harvested, of course,
that knocks down a lot of Japanese beetles
[SPEAKER_03]: with the blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so evidently what happens,
they're looking for a warmer home,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they dig their way inside of the
berries themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And conceal themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The adults feed on the foliage,
fruit, and flowers of more than 300 kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But blueberries and grapes are two of
their preferred hosts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larvae are C-shaped grubs in the soil
and do serious damage, especially to
[SPEAKER_03]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're distinguishing characters of
the grubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, of course, the rastral pattern,
which is right under the underside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Japanese beetles, it's shaped like
a V.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty easy to distinguish from most
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the adult beetle, of course,
is metallic green and coppery brown wing
[SPEAKER_03]: covers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tufts of white hair along the edge of the
sides of the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: The adults are about a half an inch long.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after you haven't worked with them for
a while, you start thinking they're larger
[SPEAKER_03]: and larger because there's so much of a
problem to our growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larvae feed principally on grass
roots, as I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they show up, the adults show up
around the same time that we start seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: ripe blueberries here in northern Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's around the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that time, when the females emerge
from the soil, the eggs mate very close to
[SPEAKER_03]: that time because the males are so
strongly attracted to them that you'll see
[SPEAKER_03]: just a lot of activity on the ground as
the females, the virgin females,
[SPEAKER_03]: come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes it for interesting behavior
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the wintertime, they go down
from 3 to 12 inches in the soil the larvae
[SPEAKER_03]: do and come up in the following spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is but one generation a year here in
northern Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in some colder areas,
come different states, it takes two years
[SPEAKER_03]: to complete the life cycle further north
and where it's a lot colder than it is
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beetles prefer foliage exposed to
direct sunlight and often are seen
[SPEAKER_03]: clustered together, feeding on tender,
vegetative part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damaged leaves have a laced appearance and
severely affected leaves will drop off.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the same for blueberries or for
grapes that we work with a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In southern Ontario and northern New
England and the Adirondacks of western
[SPEAKER_03]: regions of New York that are unusually
cold and also in southern New England
[SPEAKER_03]: portions, it takes two years to complete
the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that would be useful here too if we
could get rid of them for one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the last three years, we have seen a
lot of Japanese beetles, especially right
[SPEAKER_03]: here at Worcester because we've had just
about the right amount of rain and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really been a hectic time for us
and we've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this varies from area to area of
course, but the last two years prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: 2009 were really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you go further south, then you get an
earlier emergence as you would expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: In southern Georgia, they may come out in
early May and mid June.
[SPEAKER_03]: North Carolina and Kentucky, but until
July in eastern Massachusetts and Ohio in
[SPEAKER_03]: this area, this far north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Males begin to emerge a few days earlier
than females and the sex ratio of adults
[SPEAKER_03]: emerging in the field is about one to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: To control the Japanese beetles and other
fruit insects, I recommend that you go to
[SPEAKER_03]: your local extension publications because
some things are illegal in some places and
[SPEAKER_03]: not another.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, Ohio and New York have
pretty different regulations due to their
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions that they have there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, despite the concerns of the federal
and states to eradicate it, then to limit
[SPEAKER_03]: its spread, the JB progressively extended
its range and now it is in most of
[SPEAKER_03]: widespread and destructive insect pests of
turf and landscape plants in the eastern
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than $460 million is expended each
year for direct control cost and for
[SPEAKER_03]: renovating or replacing damaged turf and
ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese beetles also damage fruit crops,
soybeans, maize, and other gardens and
[SPEAKER_03]: field crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Larvae and adults are targets for
substantial insecticide usage,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially on home lawns, golf courses,
and urban landscapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some research that we've done here and
surrounding states, we've picked this
[SPEAKER_03]: information up and I think most of this is
in our label book for the Midwest
[SPEAKER_03]: Commercial Small Fruit and Grape Spray
Guide 2009 and it will soon be out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010 version.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you wanted to know more on the
pesticides for blueberries, you could go
[SPEAKER_03]: to that on the website, this Midwest
Commercial Small Fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most common one here is 7XLR and the
XLR type of 7 is the best because it will
[SPEAKER_03]: hold on leaves that are more or less waxy
or slick, such as some of the grape
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the blueberry leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 7 does a good job, but you do have some
problems there if you're doing it at
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest because you have to wait 7 days if
you use 7.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's one of the holdbacks on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's other things that you can use
that do a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you want to harvest real soon
after spring, then you've got to wait and
[SPEAKER_03]: watch the PHI on those different
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all of those that are listed there
are labeled for blueberries, at least in
[SPEAKER_03]: Ohio and somewhere or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mustang Max is labeled for other
insects, not Japanese beetle, but it could
[SPEAKER_03]: be used for the other insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, seasonal trapping of Japanese
beetle.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more or less systematic in that
most of our peaks for Japanese beetle come
[SPEAKER_03]: out sometime in August there usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this year I was just over in Portugal
in November and on the Azores there,
[SPEAKER_03]: they had noticed something really strange
about their population because the peaks
[SPEAKER_03]: all were in late September and we never
have experienced them quite that late.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen them range into there,
but most of it is usually in August.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not sure exactly why the peaks
are changing, but they speculate that
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe global warming is having something
to do with it out there in the Azores.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's just to kind of give you
an idea of where you might be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: control Japanese beetles either in the
grub stage and which methods you could use
[SPEAKER_03]: and also in the adult stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go over that a little bit more as we
go into the other slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another option here for controlling
spores, and this is particularly in high
[SPEAKER_03]: value places, such as golf course greens
and so forth, Milky Spore could be used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Milky Spore is of course pretty expensive
and it was actually taken off the market
[SPEAKER_03]: here about 10 years ago because they
started checking the shelf life of some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Milky Spore disease that was for sale
and it wasn't up to snuff, so the USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: made them take it off and then be checked
so now the spore counts are up and it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like it's working much better,
but you can run up something like $350,
[SPEAKER_03]: $360 an acre if you put it down the way
they recommend in lines, even on golf
[SPEAKER_03]: courses or your backyard or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not very many people do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course the other thing you
have to worry about on the Japanese beetle
[SPEAKER_03]: is that the adults are such strong flyers
that you're not going to really do
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself very much good by putting it in
your yard to rid yourself of the adults
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might get rid of the grubs,
but the adults are going to be flying into
[SPEAKER_03]: your roses and other things anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the tests that we did this past
summer with the blueberry grower here,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were trying to look at some different
fungi that would control Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used typical Japanese beetle trap on
top of this auto-dissemination trap and as
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see it's kind of an interesting
makeup of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too easy to go through,
but the Japanese beetles come into their
[SPEAKER_03]: lures and then they fall down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese beetles fall down into here
and this seems to have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: room than the ones we made here,
but they're the same design actually
[SPEAKER_03]: except that they have a thicker top and
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this little door right here is
where you put your petri dish in full of
[SPEAKER_03]: either your Boveria like we used or the
Metareseum which we use in the Azores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the beetles fall down, they come down
into here and the main problem or one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the problems could be water because it
collects rainfall and this forces it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So underneath this there's a screen to let
the water out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the beetles are supposed to walk
across this petri dish that's inside this
[SPEAKER_03]: door being attracted out to this light
over here that's just a piece of glass in
[SPEAKER_03]: there and this is just open for them to
fall out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done our test by using this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Oklahoma, it's been three or four years
ago, they had such dry conditions and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth they decided that they would use a
wet auger petri dish and put it in as the
[SPEAKER_03]: spores were developing so that they
wouldn't get blown around so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they designed a new trap,
auto-dissemination trap, which was made
[SPEAKER_03]: out of PVC pipe and it worked pretty good,
but they didn't really do enough testing
[SPEAKER_03]: to know if it was going to be satisfactory
for killing a lot of beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we have just a slide just mentioning
that we have a fly and also a little wasp
[SPEAKER_03]: that attacked the beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Japanese beetle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been introduced and they do a
fairly good job, a fair job I might say,
[SPEAKER_03]: on one of the golf courses or several of
the golf courses I believe up in
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've tried to introduce them into Ohio
and we have had absolutely no luck in
[SPEAKER_03]: getting anything established.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've moved them to the mountain areas
near Boone, North Carolina and there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: area up in there five or six miles that is
supposed to have pretty good control from
[SPEAKER_03]: these parasites and predators.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pheromone is something that was
developed here in Worcester by T.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladd and Mick Klein.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you probably know them and so
they're used along with the feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: attractant to attract in the beetles to
our auto-dissemination traps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this one was put in and then we
didn't take it back out, but unfortunately
[SPEAKER_03]: this was developed and they actually
isolated something that would shut down
[SPEAKER_03]: the identification of the pheromone so
that it couldn't be detected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked in the laboratory but it wasn't
field tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after some more testing and maybe using
some different methods they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: work something out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that developed this is one of the
leading guys on beetle, especially scarab
[SPEAKER_03]: pheromones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's really good at it and he thinks
that this has some real possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nematodes are another thing that are
useful especially in golf courses and
[SPEAKER_03]: high-value places.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a scientist here by the name of
Parwinder Grewal who's working on that
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect and having some pretty good luck as
far as golf greens and things like that
[SPEAKER_03]: and using it on a lot of different
insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: The material that we've been using in this
auto-dissemination trap is a Bolveria and
[SPEAKER_03]: we've been using Bolveria here and over in
the Azores.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bolveria is labeled gives white spores
and this company that I wasn't familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with until recently has helped us and
supplied us with material and we're kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of happy with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't change the formulation at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just used what came commercially and
that's what we put our traps out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We set our traps out using their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here again, this is the trap that we used.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only difference from the one that's
been used before there in the Azores is
[SPEAKER_03]: this trap is a different kind of Japanese
beetle trap and it actually goes down
[SPEAKER_03]: inside a little bit and that makes it a
little bit restricted there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here you can see that we use sponges
and we put the mixtures in with water
[SPEAKER_03]: usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beetles come down in through here and
then they get clogged up there a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit if there's too many of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, they're supposed to walk
inside over this sponge or without this
[SPEAKER_03]: sponge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them we had it out in this plain
water for the check.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plans are in the future that they would
just be released here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were collecting them so we could do
bio-essays in the lab on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can see another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can see down inside of a trap
showing the number of beetles that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually built up there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they build up too much, sometimes
they can get away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see underneath here where a lot of
them were congregating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right under the trap we put some duct tape
there because too many of them were
[SPEAKER_03]: congregating there trying to get out
rather than going down to the other end
[SPEAKER_03]: and walking through the fungus to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can see a little bit different
situations how the trap was set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used just regular ring jars or
canisters on the bottom to collect them
[SPEAKER_03]: when we were going to do some tests with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the different treatments that we
used, the different five different
[SPEAKER_03]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one we had the spray in a Petri
dish, sponge in a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second one, no sponge.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third one with the sponge at a
different concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the fourth one was the powder in the
Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without water and without sponge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was this one here which did the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just the powder itself mixed with
water and with no sponge.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see I need to get my pointer here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These right here, this tall one,
that was the best and that was just the
[SPEAKER_03]: powder that they sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go to the next slide there but anyway
you can see that the ones where we mixed
[SPEAKER_03]: water in the sponge didn't do as good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a later version of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that bio essay on the 27th of
August and then the 7th of September we
[SPEAKER_03]: did a another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what the Japanese beetles look
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if this was Metaresium, of course
these would be green spores but look very
[SPEAKER_03]: similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit closer up picture of
those but you can still tell that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roger, yeah actually keep your microphone
on for a sec because I think we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one interesting one and Carl
asks how does increasing the soil organic
[SPEAKER_05]: matter help to manage the Japanese beetle
population?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak to that at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well the Japanese beetle grubs they kind
of thrive on organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends if it's the kind that they like
or not but they really like grass roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's their preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like it might not so that's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really can't tell you how the
organic matter would help reduce them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like the green June bug thrives on
the underside of bales of hay and so forth
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of the questions that were
asked earlier in the presentation for
[SPEAKER_03]: example is the spring tiffia wasp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was mentioned as a way to
manage Japanese beetles and there was
[SPEAKER_05]: another question about technid flies
specifically and I'm not sure if that was
[SPEAKER_05]: the species of fly that is helpful in
controlling Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roger?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, both of these things are good and
we've tried many times to introduce them
[SPEAKER_03]: into the Azores where we figured the
climate would be a little bit milder and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we've tried to introduce them here in
the Worcester where we have you know
[SPEAKER_03]: moderately cold climate and we just
haven't done very much good at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a hit or miss thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now whether they can be counted on I don't
know but there where that one is
[SPEAKER_03]: established in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a crab crop that is effective for
blueberries?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know of any widespread things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we usually just say put raspberries
near them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A trap crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have a question it was a
comment made privately but do you know if
[SPEAKER_05]: they've tried using infrared on conveyor
belts to see if that actually pops the
[SPEAKER_05]: Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this technology is being used
to control some pests of grains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got a question about the
effectiveness of milky spore in colder
[SPEAKER_03]: climates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of the folks that are logged on are
actually from New England area and upstate
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that in there was some studies done
at Cornell that implied that milky spore
[SPEAKER_05]: was not very effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just didn't get it didn't build up
enough of a population.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you read anything more recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: No I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The latest person I've talked to that's
knowledgeable on that is Mick Klein and he
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to think here you know for the
conditions we have here which are pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: cold that it's working pretty good now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a while there the shelf life just
wasn't any good and so they made him step
[SPEAKER_03]: that up and now they released it for them
to sell it again and I just wonder if the
[SPEAKER_03]: studies could have been done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry for interrupting I just I was
reading this thing from Satnam Basra.
[SPEAKER_05]: He comments that infrared was used at a
nursery farm in Michigan and so that's
[SPEAKER_05]: really interesting to see that that was
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of different questions
Carl primarily about effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_05]: vertebrae and invertebrate predators.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming you're talking about birds
and I think the invertebrates we've talked
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit about nematodes and other
kinds of parasites and other natural
[SPEAKER_05]: controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's one more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does no-till have adverse or beneficial
impacts on Japanese beetle population?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I'm afraid that no-till would not be
you know very good because it would allow
[SPEAKER_03]: the grasses to grow in there unless you
came in and wiped out the grasses too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've seen some things where no-till
makes the insect problems worse you know
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I because we're starting to run out
of time and I'm sorry to cut you the
[SPEAKER_05]: questions off but I just want to make sure
that people have time to download the
[SPEAKER_05]: information sheets that we mentioned
briefly at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone has any additional
questions for Robert Childs or Roger
[SPEAKER_05]: Williams.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very happy that they took time out to
get their presentations ready and practice
[SPEAKER_05]: and learn this new kind of delivery
technique but I am very very happy that
[SPEAKER_05]: you folks participated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to remind everybody that we've
got quite a long break here for the
[SPEAKER_05]: holidays before our last series of
webinars on brambles which begin on
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday January 6th.
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to kind of keep momentum up you
may see some emails during the holidays
[SPEAKER_05]: from me to remind you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will try not to be obnoxious with them
but I don't want people to forget about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well maybe they come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost my auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: She lost her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh somebody said yes they could hear me
now.
Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Laura can hear now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I don't know if anybody can hear or
not but anyway I thank everyone for
[SPEAKER_03]: showing up and putting up with us and hope
everybody will have a good day tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Roger I got my audio back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what happened but I want to
thank you and I apologize about the polls.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what happened with them but
they just completely froze up and we had
[SPEAKER_05]: some other little weird things that
happened during the presentation but I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: glad that you weren't affected and I hope
you have a great holiday season so thanks
[SPEAKER_05]: again for being part of this.
Thank you.
