[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Donna Nugger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a youth development educator with
University of Illinois Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with the 4-H program and youth
activities in metro communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do things that are a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my world is about STEM,
and I've found that climate change has
[SPEAKER_01]: been one of the things that our youth are
concerned about, they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have been very motivated by some
of the opportunities through 4-H,
[SPEAKER_01]: through the Ag Innovators program,
some of the STEM challenges that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: available, and that you can get these
things through shop 4-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are available to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last year, the science ambassadors
who are all middle school and high school,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're early teens through high
school, go out and they do teen teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: and outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work in some of our underserved
communities and do large walk-by
[SPEAKER_01]: activities down to small group activities
for smaller groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group I have with me today have been
very active in developing an app to track
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon outputs and give alternatives on
how to reduce your carbon outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Ashmit Gambir, Dharmik Mudapathi,
and Joshua George with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are part of a team that was working
on a program called BLAST.
[SPEAKER_01]: And BLAST was offered rather in
Naperville, which is one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: communities in my unit, which serves three
counties in the Chicago metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And BLAST is about building leadership
around sustainable transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a program that teens took
their ideas, their concerns, and developed
[SPEAKER_01]: a program to get something done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are three of the guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're my coding experts because you need
that coding for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have another larger group of
youth who also did a lot of research to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the information that they needed to
use to put it into the app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, I'm going to turn it
over to my 4-H team and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take over and tell you a little bit about
what they were doing, how they just got to
[SPEAKER_01]: that point, and about some of the coding
that they've been teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 4-H team, you can get in and do your
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why did we start this project?
[SPEAKER_04]: So since all of us are soon to be computer
science majors, we wanted to have an app
[SPEAKER_04]: that has practical solutions for
day-to-day applications and for it to be
[SPEAKER_04]: easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether you have an iPhone or an
Android, we want it to be on the Apple and
[SPEAKER_04]: Google Play Store.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we specifically, since all of us are
environmental activists, we wanted to have
[SPEAKER_04]: an app that promotes sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the three topics that we dove into are
carbon emissions, water conservation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and food waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So later on in this presentation,
we're going to get into the specifics of
[SPEAKER_04]: why we wanted to dive into these three
topics and also, of course, give our,
[SPEAKER_04]: how we implemented these solutions into
our app and the functions of the app.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanted to influence an app that
influences the long-term generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since climate change is an existing
problem that we have and we need it to
[SPEAKER_04]: promote sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's our timeline of our project.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, we started our first team
meeting, and that was back in,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, January of 2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like Ms. Nugar mentioned before,
we're actually three out of eight people
[SPEAKER_03]: that joined in on this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from there, we actually broke off into
a different research group.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was carbon emissions, one was food
waste, and also water conservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from there, we actually received a
grant from Apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: They provided us with iPads to actually
start on the coding processes for this
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, we developed a prototype
on Figma, this application where we can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of just outline our program without
actually starting on coding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually started on Figma first
before presenting at GLAST.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Ms. Nugar touched upon that,
but we were there in hopes of receiving
[SPEAKER_03]: funding for our app.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was at GLAST.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then right now, we're actually
educating the other people in our group on
[SPEAKER_03]: the basics of SWIFT so we can actually
start on programming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our goal eventually is to get this
published and available on the App Store.
[SPEAKER_03]: On to our first topic, carbon emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have some stats on the screen right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, the average US
passenger car emits about 2.7 metric tons
[SPEAKER_03]: of CO2 per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our goal is to try to get that number
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can see that food transportation is
responsible for 19% of all carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So along with that, there's also a diagram
you can see up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says that cars and vans have
around, I think, 48% our biggest share of
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2 emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, it's the freight trains
and trucks, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how does our app actually combat these
problems?
[SPEAKER_03]: So our app has two functions on the carbon
emissions part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them is to input our ride info.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say if you take a 20-minute car ride,
it'll provide the output of carbon emitted
[SPEAKER_03]: based on the time elapsed, and it'll also
provide an alternate route of travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was our first function.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second function is it'll provide a
carbon footprint based on the food
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging of any food, let's say,
you get at the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you input the brand and the type of
food, it'll output the exact carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: footprint based on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second component of our app is water
conservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what is water conservation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Water conservation is using water
efficiently and effectively to provide and
[SPEAKER_05]: prevent using water unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the main problem that stems
from this is that freshwater resources are
[SPEAKER_05]: limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to combat that by having
healthy habits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to promote that by using it as
features in our app.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as you can see in the pie chart,
about 20% of the water that we use comes
[SPEAKER_05]: from toilets, showers, faucets,
clothes, and washrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of these things are in our own
household.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we believe that with our functions,
we will be able to combat this usage with
[SPEAKER_05]: our two functions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our two functions are meaningful
reminders and providing a personalized
[SPEAKER_05]: list for the user.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the first one, the meaningful
reminders.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the user will input their water usage,
and we want to provide the user with more
[SPEAKER_05]: information about how to cut down their
water usage, like what they can do and
[SPEAKER_05]: some calculations of how much water
they've been using and how to prevent them
[SPEAKER_05]: from using that much water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our second one, providing a
personalized list for the user.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to have personalized things for
the user that they have inputted and based
[SPEAKER_05]: off of their needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for example, for me, one of the
things that I would do is I've been using
[SPEAKER_05]: a water bucket at home to collect rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been just storing it in that
bucket and using it for daily tasks such
[SPEAKER_05]: as watering plants, cleaning outdoors,
and flushing toilets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talked to my family about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found it very beneficial and
healthy for the environment because we're
[SPEAKER_05]: not using as much water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're saving the water because we're
collecting it from the rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so some other examples are mulch and
compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the water bucket with the rain,
that is what I found the most beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was something that worked for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to have something
personalized like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to use that as a function in
our app.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the final topic that we dove into
is food waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are some facts that I found
really interesting about food waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I found that one third of the world's
food goes to waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see on the picture,
on the graphic on the bottom, it shows how
[SPEAKER_04]: 43% of homes is where our waste comes
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40% comes from restaurants, groceries,
and food service companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: 16% comes from farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 2% comes from manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just really wanted to have our app
combat all these problems and have less
[SPEAKER_04]: food being wasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for our app function for food waste,
we have three specific functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first one is inputting food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, the user inputs whatever food
they bought and the expiration dates of
[SPEAKER_04]: those produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as it gets closer to the date of
expiration, the app is going to constantly
[SPEAKER_04]: send reminders on recently bought food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to give you a friendly
reminder on when the item is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: perished.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the second app function,
with the expiration date being passed for
[SPEAKER_04]: the produce, the app is going to send
specific recipes that you can make with
[SPEAKER_04]: the expired produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So such as, for example, bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: When bananas are perished, the app would
send a recipe of banana bread that you
[SPEAKER_04]: could make.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then for our third and final function
of this app, we would have location.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the user would input their location.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a 50-mile radius would be
generated to find the nearest donation
[SPEAKER_04]: food center.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all these three functions contribute to
less food waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have many goals to promote a healthy
environment and promote sustainable
[SPEAKER_05]: habits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we are planning on promoting these
healthy habits through our app.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our first goal that we have is to
continue to teach classes to other
[SPEAKER_05]: students.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so prior, we have succeeded in
teaching classes as we've been going to
[SPEAKER_05]: other schools and other offices to teach
classes using the Swift language.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so from the grant from Apple that our
4-H group received, we're given many
[SPEAKER_05]: resources such as iPads, Apple Pencils,
while also getting their full support.
[SPEAKER_05]: These resources were very useful for
teaching the students.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're able to show the app that we're
making with our full timeline of events to
[SPEAKER_05]: the students.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this allowed the students to see what
our app was, how it worked, and what we
[SPEAKER_05]: did to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this was able to inspire the other
students.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were inspired to make their own
app.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was that app that they wanted to
make was something similar to what we've
[SPEAKER_05]: been making.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we spoke to some of the students,
and they told us that they were interested
[SPEAKER_05]: in making their own apps about
environmental sustainability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a very big progress step that
we wanted to make.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is something that we were very
proud of as we were able to promote a
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our second goal is to continue
working on the app and to ultimately
[SPEAKER_05]: publish it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want this app to have a big
impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once we're done with the coding,
we'll be able to publish it on the App
[SPEAKER_05]: Store and Google Play Store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this will help promote positive
change, which is our third goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been doing this throughout.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been promoting positive change
throughout, as I said prior, by inspiring
[SPEAKER_05]: other students to create their own apps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we believe that this is very
necessary to promote healthy environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: change and promote a positive impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: People will be conserving water better,
they'll be reducing carbon emissions,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll be wasting less food while
just making better and healthier decisions
[SPEAKER_05]: overall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these will all ultimately assist us in
reducing the impact of environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges that we face today as a world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hope to bring positive change day
by day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening to our
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I greatly appreciate your attention in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to thank and
congratulate these young people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came up with these ideas themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not created by any adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came to me and said they wanted to
take their talents and find ways to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very grateful to a couple of the other
members who are now off at college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very, very busy doing other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the one who got us into BLAST to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were people who were already into
environmental issues and wanted to take
[SPEAKER_01]: this further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're grateful for all the teaching
that these guys have been doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're providing opportunities to
youth who otherwise would not have an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin, if you have any questions,
we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be happy to answer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have our questions and answers open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, a lot of our questions
and answers are just outstanding,
[SPEAKER_02]: great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fantastic presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a fun way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few kind of direct... Oh,
David has a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just I thought those were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As James was just saying, I'm just kind of
wondering how you all think this
[SPEAKER_00]: individually might kind of help you sort
of take your next steps in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: your work on this, in terms of what you
each want to move on to do after this is
[SPEAKER_00]: finished and a success, let's say.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really looking forward to
publishing this app and promoting a
[SPEAKER_05]: positive change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that is something that we've been
very interested in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been combining this with coding as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so coding is our very big hobby for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been teaching classes, and we're all
planning and hoping to be computer science
[SPEAKER_05]: majors as we apply this coming year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been combining two of our
interests into one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is just something that we're
really interested in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this positive change that we've been
promoting, and that we've seen already
[SPEAKER_05]: happened so far, these results that we've
seen, we've found those outstanding,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we just want to keep seeing more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just really love the positive
impact and change that it has.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you considered exploring info about
the carbon footprints of, say,
[SPEAKER_02]: larger corporations or transportation
industries like airlines and the like to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide information in your app for that
as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Josh is talking, but he's muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I believe that we would be
looking at some more larger corporations
[SPEAKER_03]: like airlines and I think it said,
yeah, larger corporations, airlines,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now we just started focusing on
the driving aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think when we were looking at
users, they'll use this app when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe that's more in their everyday
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could incorporate something with
airlines or even corporations,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe just put an informational article
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from my perspective, a thing that
I would like to hear, a lot of our
[SPEAKER_02]: attendees in the meeting are practitioners
similar to me or Donna.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from your perspective, what do you
find has been one of the more helpful
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects, I guess, from the extension or
the 4-H system as you've gone along in
[SPEAKER_02]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us are trying to figure out how
to best support the young people that we
[SPEAKER_02]: work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have any specific thoughts
on that, I would appreciate it myself at
[SPEAKER_02]: least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the 4-H organization really
supports us really well with especially
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms. Nugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been supporting us through all these
different activities and giving us the
[SPEAKER_04]: resources that we need to better our app
and even our activities that we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: With teaching and everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, just supporting resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, like with the iPads, we wouldn't
have been able to do all this Swift coding
[SPEAKER_04]: without the Apple grant that we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like putting our support,
putting your support to us will just drive
[SPEAKER_04]: us exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So providing that space for you to explore
your interests and making sure you're
[SPEAKER_02]: supported.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
