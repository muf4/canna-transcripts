[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Lynn, for a very nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also very fortunate to work with Lynn
because she's an amazing wheat scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think working together, you will see
that in our presentation today,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are doing such a good job, I think,
as wheat scientists.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my presentation today will be really on
novel technologies applied to specialty
[SPEAKER_06]: crop, on just showcasing some of the
projects that Lynn and I have been working
[SPEAKER_06]: over the last three to four years with
these new technologies this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just my background, very quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like Lynn mentioned, I'm an
associate professor on extension
[SPEAKER_06]: specialist in wheat science for specialty
crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a two-way split where I'm doing
research, I'm doing extension,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, it's 100% all the time,
especially this semester, fall semester
[SPEAKER_06]: for me is really big semester.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two classes I'm teaching in
semester.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fall semester, I'm teaching wheat
science at Rutgers, and I'm also teaching
[SPEAKER_06]: an introduction to horticulture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my research station is located at the
Philip E.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marucci Blueberry and Cranberry Research
and Extension Center, right in the middle
[SPEAKER_06]: of the Pine Barrens, a southern part of
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Initially, I did a lot of work on
blueberry and cranberry, but over the
[SPEAKER_06]: years, I expanded that to specialty crops,
including veggies and tree fruits.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the station, we have a very diverse
group of researchers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have people from USDA on Rutgers doing
work on cranberry and blueberry breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a bioinformatician.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a diverse team of entomologists,
plant pathologists, and wheat scientists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have also molecular biology as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we are working on cranberry,
we have someone from Ocean Spray,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is located on our research station
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are specialty crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be the topic of what we are
discussing today.
[SPEAKER_06]: But specialty crops, for me, in my
opinion, are any fruits bearing a plant
[SPEAKER_06]: that is not soybean, field corn,
or wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which doesn't exclude the fact that from
time to time, I can do soybean work as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything else, truthfully for us in
New Jersey, is considered specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: My research on extension focus is really
on cranberry, because New Jersey is
[SPEAKER_06]: ranking number three in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blueberry, we're ranking number five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peach, we're still ranking number five.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ranking number five in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the veggies, New Jersey is ranking
relatively high for pepper.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the last few years, I did work on
pepper, cooker beets, asparagus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm increasing my work on grape as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was mentioning the Marucci Center,
the Marucci Center is located right in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Pimerons.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have extension.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have research site in South Jersey right
here at Rarik.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have also research site at Snyder in
Northern Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: So different type of environmental
condition between South Jersey and North
[SPEAKER_06]: Jersey, which is very closer from what you
have here in New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just some of what we're doing in my
research, in my wheat science team at
[SPEAKER_06]: Rutgers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We try to understand the biology and
ecology of various wheat species that
[SPEAKER_06]: treat the sustainability and profitability
of major New Jersey specialty crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking at developing integrated
wheat management practices to provide
[SPEAKER_06]: effective on economically viable
strategies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely, over the last few years,
we have been doing a lot of work assessing
[SPEAKER_06]: the risk and benefits of new wheat control
technologies for New Jersey specialty
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, when we're looking at weeds,
I mean, it's always good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we'll be discussing today in
context, but why are weeds really
[SPEAKER_06]: important for specialty crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you're looking at what would be
the yield losses due to unmanaged weeds in
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the major North American crops,
everything else being conducted perfectly,
[SPEAKER_06]: meaning that you're getting good
fertilization, you're getting good disease
[SPEAKER_06]: and insect control.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just let the wheat compete,
you're getting between 50% and 70% yield
[SPEAKER_06]: losses for some of these major crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for soybean, for example, that would be
equivalent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we are losing around 70%.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are losing around $19 billion each year
due to weed management issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing for corn, dry beans,
over $700 million of yield loss caused by
[SPEAKER_06]: wheat competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: So direct competition for nutrients or
water or any kind of resource is not the
[SPEAKER_06]: only impact of weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have other impacts to consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these weeds really reduce harvest
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here, you're looking at Palmer
Amarant in corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the size of Palmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's me right here on the picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Palmer can grow extremely tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're starting to get Palmer in
a corn field, clearly, when you will be
[SPEAKER_06]: harvesting, just the fact that you have
Palmer will reduce not just your yield,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the speed at which you can harvest the
crop as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is a picture that I took in
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you see right here is Dodder growing
in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dodder can be extremely parasitic and
cause several yield losses in blueberry
[SPEAKER_06]: just because it's a parasitic plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have Dodder in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Dodder in cranberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, I mean, parasitism is something to
consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these weeds can also be a host for
pests on disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to consider as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last thing is probably one of my
favorite weeds just because it's in
[SPEAKER_06]: cranberry right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're looking at cranberry on
everything that you see, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: yellow, brownish.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is actually called Carolina redwood.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent a lot of time before getting
tenure working on Carolina redwood.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was really interesting because
cranberry is a really low growing crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have this Carolina redwood,
which is overwhelming, dominating the
[SPEAKER_06]: cranberry canopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you are applying fungicide,
when you are applying insecticide to
[SPEAKER_06]: cranberry, most of the spray will be
intercepted by the Carolina redwood.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just because you have the weeds,
you will have to affect other management
[SPEAKER_06]: program as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will not get your insecticide.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will not get your fungicide where you
need them to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we are talking about weeds,
herbicide is still the number one solution
[SPEAKER_06]: for weed management.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in 2022, there was around 266 million
acres of crops in the United States that
[SPEAKER_06]: were treated with herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a dominant in terms of acreage is
really the dominant pesticides that we are
[SPEAKER_06]: using for managing pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this can be rapidly changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big problems that we are facing on
Vipan and Lynn will not deny it because
[SPEAKER_06]: they are also working on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But clearly, I mean, herbicide resistance
is really a major issue that we are facing
[SPEAKER_06]: these days is 533 unique cases of
herbicide resistance to 168 herbicides
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been documented in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning that herbicides that were at some
point controlling these weeds at a
[SPEAKER_06]: specific rate are not controlling the
weeds anymore because the weeds evolve
[SPEAKER_06]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were able either by different way to
survive this herbicide application.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have export market access, especially
when you're starting to look like
[SPEAKER_06]: exporting to Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these herbicide may not be
accepted in other countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we may have restrictions on what we can
export to Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or China, anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consumer perception, I mean, more and more
consumers are reluctant to the use of
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticide, including herbicide,
of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last thing which is really to
consider as well is that, yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you're using a pesticide,
it's not something which is neutral.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have to take into account the
fact that you need to protect your worker.
[SPEAKER_06]: On some of these herbicide also,
I mean, you heard about 240 or Dicamba
[SPEAKER_06]: drift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these herbicide may be causing a
lot of injury to other crop as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has been a problem in recent years
with some specific herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: Increasing prevalence of herbicide
resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, many of the herbicide resistant case
are located known for soybean,
[SPEAKER_06]: corn, wheat, and barley, and rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're looking at specialty crop,
if you're looking at our chart,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are actually number six in terms of
number of cases of herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just something which is for
agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also something which is affecting us
in specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a picture of what we have in New
Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn and Vipam could probably draw the
same table for New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I mean, the first case of
herbicide resistance in New Jersey was
[SPEAKER_06]: documented in 1980.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smooth pigweed resistant to the
photosystem 2 inhibitor, atrazine,
[SPEAKER_06]: simazine, and metribuzine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just last year, I mean, I documented a
new case in New Jersey where we have
[SPEAKER_06]: goosegrass evolving resistance to
glyphosate in soybean field, which is also
[SPEAKER_06]: a problem for us in specialty crops
because many of these weeds will not just
[SPEAKER_06]: stick to the soybeans.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will move to other cropping system,
especially if you're looking at New
[SPEAKER_06]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a very intricate network of crop
where you may have a soybean field.
[SPEAKER_06]: On next week, you will get a blueberry
field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these goosegrass species will love
moving into the blueberry field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oursweed, my team will be working on
investigating oresweed resistant to
[SPEAKER_06]: powerquats and potentially to mesotrion as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have constant case of potential
herbicide resistance that are popping up
[SPEAKER_06]: in New Jersey as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big game changer these days is also
the fact that we have some new regulatory
[SPEAKER_06]: changes that we have to face, especially
regarding the Undangered Spaces Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all federal agencies, including the
EPA, who are registering a pesticide,
[SPEAKER_06]: must ensure that the actions they carry
out, fund, or authorize does not
[SPEAKER_06]: negatively impact treated and undangered
species of their critical habitat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one good example for us in the East,
including New Jersey and New York,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's in New York as well,
the bog turtle is one of these undangered
[SPEAKER_06]: species that we need to consider in terms
of protection and make sure that when you
[SPEAKER_06]: are using herbicide, insecticide,
fungicide, the use of these pesticides
[SPEAKER_06]: will not be putting a greater treat on
species that are already undangered.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these days, there is a new EPA
Undangered Spaces Act work plan for
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide that has been produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, the plan will introduce some
new restrictions on the use of some of
[SPEAKER_06]: these herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our growers will have to face new
mitigation measures for reducing spread
[SPEAKER_06]: drift, reducing runoff erosion,
potentially reducing any kind of other
[SPEAKER_06]: measures that will reduce pesticide
exposure to undangered species and their
[SPEAKER_06]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clearly, if you're looking at the
picture of using herbicide these days,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are getting into a different
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will not get the same freedom at
using herbicide in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clearly, that can make herbicide more
difficult to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to start looking at what
alternative we can have to herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a paper published in 2018
looking at what will be weed management in
[SPEAKER_06]: 2050.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that herbicide are not going away.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still need to use some of these
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know in some situation how to
replace them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to point out that we don't
have any new mode of action that have been
[SPEAKER_06]: released across large acreage on specialty
crops in 30 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is nothing in the pie,
basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking at other disciplines in
pathology, entomology, yes, they're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting new pesticide, new insecticide,
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the case for us in weed
science.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's also something which is
stimulating the fact that we need to
[SPEAKER_06]: really to look at these new technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Biological control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leon and I were in a class with Steve
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are discussing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't really have biological
control in weed science.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're an entomologist, you know that
you can use some biological control for
[SPEAKER_06]: controlling insects.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have this kind of opportunity in
weed science.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is work which is conducted on
announcing crop biology for improving the
[SPEAKER_06]: crop competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that needs to be further
developed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of what we're doing these days is
really looking at these new tools and
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at precision agriculture and
looking at robotic equipment that can be
[SPEAKER_06]: not replacing but supplementing the use of
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we'll be discussing today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will discuss three different types
of technologies that I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: investigating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lina investigated the same kind of
technology as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be looking at targeted spraying
right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be looking at autonomous seeder on
weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the last one, probably the most
exciting one, is looking at laser weeder,
[SPEAKER_06]: using laser for killing the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one, which is really what I'm
calling the optically targeted herbicide
[SPEAKER_06]: spraying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that we did in high
bush blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Lina conducted the same experiment
looking at grape.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this kind of technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, my two principal collaborators,
well, Lina, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, Lina and I, we worked a lot with
IR4, with Roger about IR4, because this
[SPEAKER_06]: project was considered to be an integrated
solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So coming up with some things that can be
reduced.
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of herbicides that we are
using.
[SPEAKER_06]: So IR4 was financially supporting this
project, the project that I will present.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we're looking at blueberries,
there is different challenges when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: growing blueberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is that you're not working
on a flat ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're working on a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are working on a three-dimensional
surface, if you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, when you're applying herbicide,
when you're applying anything to the soil,
[SPEAKER_06]: may be more challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've never been a big fan of drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you have a single entry point of
water where you can wash out, wash off all
[SPEAKER_06]: the herbicide out of the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, that's something challenging to
work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have weed populations that are
consisting of annual weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can deal with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have also a lot of perennial weed
species.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're working with perennial crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you will see that in weed science,
many perennial weed species are really
[SPEAKER_06]: associated with perennial cropping system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't have a lot of herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: That can really tackle these perennial
weed species.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something which is also to consider in
terms of weed management for blueberries
[SPEAKER_06]: is that blueberries are developing from
new canes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So each year, you have production of new
canes that will be the support of future
[SPEAKER_06]: production for the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to make sure that when you are
playing herbicide, you save these new
[SPEAKER_06]: canes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't damage these new canes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because otherwise, you will jeopardize
your yield potential in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a relatively narrow for weed
control, especially with post-emergence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you're looking at blueberries
this way, when they're starting to be
[SPEAKER_06]: loaded with blueberry, what will happen is
that many of these branches will start
[SPEAKER_06]: bending over the row.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it happens, there is no way you
can get any kind of equipment moving
[SPEAKER_06]: between the rows for cultivating or
applying herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will narrow the time during which
you can apply herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely, you can see it on this
picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really have a lot of reliance on
cultivation on sandy soil between the
[SPEAKER_06]: rows, which is a challenge as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why blueberry weed control matters?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, most of our blueberries in New
Jersey are grown on sandy, acidic soil
[SPEAKER_06]: with low water retention.
[SPEAKER_06]: The crop has a very shallow root system,
which means that, yes, if you have any
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of competition, especially with the
weeds, because you have very low water
[SPEAKER_06]: retention in the soil, the weeds will be
extremely competitive for pumping water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the crop is really highly sensitive to
water stress, as well as disease on insect
[SPEAKER_06]: pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really need to get good weed
control, because weeds can quickly be a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weeds can be also pests on disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, weeds can prevent proper
targeting of insecticide on fungicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look at the next slide right
here, you see what I mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking at horseweed right here
growing in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically, these horseweed, if they are
not managed early on, they can grow taller
[SPEAKER_06]: than the blueberry, and they can really
intercept any insecticide or fungicide,
[SPEAKER_06]: the same way as I was showing before with
Carolina Redwood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we have horseweed issues in
blueberry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because still many growers are relying on
glyphosate for controlling horseweed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a perfect case of herbicide
resistance, of glyphosate resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that our population of horseweed
are completely resistant to glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We cannot kill them with glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes time for growers to integrate the
fact that they need to change their
[SPEAKER_06]: practices, that glyphosate may not be the
solution anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we are talking about
optically-guided targeted spray system for
[SPEAKER_06]: weed control, what may be the advantage of
this system?
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're using the herbicide,
we want the herbicide to be especially
[SPEAKER_06]: post-emergence herbicide, the one you
applied once the weeds have emerged.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want this herbicide to be precisely
located on the weed that you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're using something that can just
apply the herbicide exactly where you need
[SPEAKER_06]: it, that would be great, because you can
reduce the volume of herbicides that you
[SPEAKER_06]: apply annually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of doing a broadcast application,
you're just applying the herbicide where
[SPEAKER_06]: it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're reducing the crop injury potential
associated with post-emergence herbicide
[SPEAKER_06]: application, because you just apply the
herbicide to the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't apply the herbicide on a
broadcast basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we did in this study is that we also
tried to evaluate new herbicides that are
[SPEAKER_06]: not specifically labeled for a crop using
this system, because since you can
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially reduce the damage caused to
the crop, you can eventually consider that
[SPEAKER_06]: new herbicide may be labeled, because you
will reduce the amount of injury to the
[SPEAKER_06]: crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And eventually, that could be considered
as a mitigation strategy for preventing
[SPEAKER_06]: off-target herbicide movement that could
negatively impact T&E species.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, you don't do a broadcast
application.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just put the herbicide where it needs
to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this system, the weed IT system,
you can see it right here, used in
[SPEAKER_06]: agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will explain the way it's working.
[SPEAKER_06]: But clearly, you cannot apply this kind of
system in agronomic crops, in specialty
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to work in specialty crops,
we decided to use a smaller system,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is really mounted on this ATV.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have a detection system right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have the spray system associated
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very smaller system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But more practical than using this kind of
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, the basic technology is the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way it's working is that you have a
sensor right here, which is emitting blue
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: This blue light will be absorbed by the
weed profile, by any kind of vegetation if
[SPEAKER_06]: you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in turn, after absorbing the blue
light, the profile will produce,
[SPEAKER_06]: will emit near-infrared interaction to the
blue light.
[SPEAKER_06]: This near-infrared will be sensed by the
sensor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sensor will trigger a spray boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will trigger the application of
herbicide exactly where you detected the
[SPEAKER_06]: profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see it right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the sensor, which is located
right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the picture of the sensor
projecting blue light on the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's divided in one, two, three,
four different sections.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each section is corresponding to a
specific nozzle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have four different independent
nozzles that can just independently apply
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide where weeds have been detected
by the sensor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had this project in 2021-2022,
both in New Jersey and New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn was working on grape.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was working on blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this project was funded by
Iofour within the Integrated Solution
[SPEAKER_06]: Program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our goal, we are ready to evaluate the
potential to safely apply novel or
[SPEAKER_06]: non-registered herbicide using a
commercially available optically-guided
[SPEAKER_06]: spray system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we wanted to compare this system,
the efficacy of this system, with a
[SPEAKER_06]: regular broadcast application.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we tested different herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will not get into the detail.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, we had references right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glufosinate was our standard herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: That blueberry and grape grower can use.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was also using 2,4-D choline in
blueberry because it's labeled for use in
[SPEAKER_06]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not labeled for use in grape.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything in red, it was new herbicides
that we tested to check if using this
[SPEAKER_06]: precision system would improve crop safety
using these herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had two different application
methods, either bonded or using the weed
[SPEAKER_06]: IT system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're looking at weed control in
blueberry, four weeks after application,
[SPEAKER_06]: I look at three different major weeds in
our blueberry plantation, ground-cell,
[SPEAKER_06]: horseweed, purslane.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a similar level of weed control
using either a regular bonded broadcast
[SPEAKER_06]: application compared to the
optically-guided weed IT system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of pure weed control efficacy,
effectiveness, we had the same level of
[SPEAKER_06]: efficacy between the two systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where it started to be really interesting
is that if you're looking at crop injury,
[SPEAKER_06]: clearly right here, that was grape canopy
injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lineups have increasing injury over time
with some of these herbicides with a
[SPEAKER_06]: bonded application, which was not the case
of vision-guided application.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way we are thinking it's working is
that some of these systemic herbicides may
[SPEAKER_06]: have been taken up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because you do a bonded application,
you have more herbicide that can be
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially absorbed by the plant compared
to the vision-guided where you just put
[SPEAKER_06]: the herbicide on the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're looking in blueberry,
we had a different picture in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if you're looking at the new
cane stunting, we saw more damage on new
[SPEAKER_06]: canes, more stunting associated with a
vision-guided in red application as
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to the bonded application.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the sink, my hypothesis is that
definitely this kind of system,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's nice, but it's not artificial
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just talking about a sensor which
is detecting crop file.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is no difference between the crop
file of blueberry plant and the crop file
[SPEAKER_06]: of a weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clearly, especially on the new canes,
we applied herbicide on the new canes
[SPEAKER_06]: because it was sensed, it was detected as
a green tissue.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had two different time of application.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the first application and the
second application right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the first application, when the canes
were relatively small, that's the canes
[SPEAKER_06]: right here, we got a lot of injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second application that came later in
the season, we saw definitely less injury
[SPEAKER_06]: because the canes started to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are less exposed to the herbicide
application.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what you can see on this
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this one was for pyroxyphen
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that this new cane
starting bending.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a group for WSSA Group 4 herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can typically see the damage
associated with oxenic herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way you're considering the system,
if it's grape or blueberry, you may have
[SPEAKER_06]: different results using this kind of
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we achieve a reduction in the
herbicide use?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I look at my data, we measured the
volume of herbicide we are using.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at blueberry treatment,
we saved between 40% and 55% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide using this system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we got the same level of weed
control.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big problem we got in blueberries is
that, yes, because it's not artificially
[SPEAKER_06]: intelligence-based system, you got injury
to the new canes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that crop injury gave us an idea,
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2024 this year, well, yes, we conducted
a new trial with Lynn where we are looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at evaluating the weed IT sprayer right
here, using it in grape for controlling
[SPEAKER_06]: suckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not trying to control the weed,
but really trying to control the suckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to get any vegetation
growing on this drawing because that's a
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrient that will not be available for
where you want to get grapes to be
[SPEAKER_06]: produced by the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had two systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a typical spray application.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's West, my technician, applying right
here, applying herbicide, working on
[SPEAKER_06]: applying herbicide on the suckers right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second one was using the weed IT
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's barely visible, but each time the
weed IT is detected, it's getting the
[SPEAKER_06]: green on the trunk and is applying
herbicide strictly on the suckers on the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's data coming from New York here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn got the same level of sucker control
between traditional and sucker removal
[SPEAKER_06]: using the wand or using the vision-guided,
the optically-guided spray system.
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference between the two was on the
wand spray system, she used less herbicide
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to the vision-guided spray
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was mostly on this case because
when they spray the herbicide,
[SPEAKER_06]: they spray both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: When with the wand spray, they only spray
one side of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't come back the other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you're looking at, you did some
further experimentation on this one,
[SPEAKER_06]: comparing one side application of the
vision-guided sprayer versus two sides,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually, you're getting the same level of
biomass reduction looking at these two
[SPEAKER_06]: types of applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the vision-guided one side will be
providing the same level of control of a
[SPEAKER_06]: regular application.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us in New Jersey, again, you're
looking at the percentage of fresh weight
[SPEAKER_06]: of the suckers as expressed as percentage
of the non-treated control.
[SPEAKER_06]: On removal, we were at the end of the
season at 6% of what we were getting
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise without removing the suckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got the same level with the weed IT
sprayer, with the vision sprayer.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are just using the wand,
yes, we get significantly better control
[SPEAKER_06]: of the suckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, we use twice more
herbicide doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clearly, for the growers, that's what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The on removal is typically what the
growers will be doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were, well, if we can save
herbicide, go faster just using the
[SPEAKER_06]: vision-guided sprayer, we are all for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to have someone walking
along the vine, along the rows,
[SPEAKER_06]: to spray herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what next with the vision-guided
sprayer?
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to get more automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornell got a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's using this new robotic platform,
the farm NG Amiga, and try to get
[SPEAKER_06]: something fully autonomous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So transferring the vision-guided sprayer
to a fully autonomous platform so you can
[SPEAKER_06]: get application of herbicide without
having someone driving the ATV like I
[SPEAKER_06]: showed you before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we plan to go in the
future with this system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at autonomous platform,
which is a second type of equipment that
[SPEAKER_06]: we are looking to investigate in our
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were looking at the NIO's autonomous
platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a project that we conducted,
yes, with Lynn, but also with Matt
[SPEAKER_06]: Bertucci and Claire Plassmeyer at
University of Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a multi-state project
investigating this new platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are some advantage of robotic
readers?
[SPEAKER_06]: With this kind of equipment, you can
really do weed prevention.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do early detection on removal of
the weed before they really start
[SPEAKER_06]: competing with the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of equipment can be extremely
precise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can have precise targeting on
removal of the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can reduce herbicide use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, what we are doing is that we
are not just using herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pure mechanical control.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have labor efficiency.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's fully autonomous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scalability.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a big system like the FarmDroid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are bigger systems than the
FarmDroid.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also have very small systems that
can be adapted for very small farming
[SPEAKER_06]: operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last one is cost savings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you have high initial investment when
you're buying this kind of system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But later, based on reduced labor on the
use of pesticides, on reduced use of
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides, you can save in cost later as
well by just using this kind of equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, autonomous platforms for me
are mostly tool carriers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will see many of them fitted with
finger weeders or shanks, anything that
[SPEAKER_06]: can mechanically control the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is really necessary required with
this platform is that you just don't want
[SPEAKER_06]: to use GPS.
[SPEAKER_06]: GPS is not precise enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get something that will give
you centimetric precision.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're planting a crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to make sure that when you're
using cultivation, it's killing the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not killing the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes the weed can be growing
extremely close to the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need what recordings are all time
kinematic, which is really a next level
[SPEAKER_06]: GPS, if you want, where you're getting
this centimetric precision that you need
[SPEAKER_06]: for controlling the weeds where they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what you have right here on the
NIO-Os, which is really a small robot,
[SPEAKER_06]: the ones that we are using.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a GPS RTK receiver right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a toolbar in the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is relatively small.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only weighing 300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 100% electric.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something also to consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not based on fuel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really based on electricity.
[SPEAKER_06]: On autonomy, it has up to eight hours of
autonomy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can run it autonomously in the
field.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can run it in the field for eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you can do with it is that,
yes, you can do weeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do mechanical weeding by using
Oblade on torsion spring weeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use finger weeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I really like with it is that you
can use a seeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been using a single row seeder
attached to the NIO-Os robot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like it because you can create a map
of your field.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a GPS system on board.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can precisely locate where your rows,
your corn rows, whatever crops you're
[SPEAKER_06]: planting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And later, you can come back for
controlling the weed between the rows
[SPEAKER_06]: because you know precisely where the rows
are located.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did some work over the last two
years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got it last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking at the efficacy of
autonomous mechanical weed control based
[SPEAKER_06]: on tools, application, frequency,
on the weed density, diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you compare these kind of tools
with a standard chemical weed control?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the crop safety?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will point out that right here,
when you're working with something like
[SPEAKER_06]: cabbage, it's really important that when
you're owing, when you're mechanically
[SPEAKER_06]: controlling the weeds, you're not damaging
the crop because otherwise, you will see
[SPEAKER_06]: yield reduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we conducted trial in 2023 at Rutgers,
Cornell, on the University of Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_06]: New Jersey, and Arkansas, we worked on
sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: On New Jersey and New York, we worked on
transplanted cabbage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see right here, the NIO-Os seeding
corn right here, working the ground,
[SPEAKER_06]: tilling the ground between the rows of
cabbage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two videos.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right here, you see the seeding
autonomously.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one is controlling the robot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seeding autonomously the corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And later, again, it's fully autonomous.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have equipment which is coming just to
control the weeds between the rows of the
[SPEAKER_06]: corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what kind of data did we get?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking at trial we did in 2023
at Rutgers, looking at the weed biomass,
[SPEAKER_06]: we tested different one, two, or three
passes of the NIO-Os.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we were getting three passes,
we were getting the same level of weed
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass reductions than using a standard
herbicide application.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, it works in terms of reducing weed
pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn did the same work.
[SPEAKER_06]: At KBH last year at Cornell, one pass was
sufficient, maybe not to provide the same
[SPEAKER_06]: level of weed control as herbicide,
but significantly reduce weed biomass
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to an untreated check.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here, it's again my different trial
we had on KBH at Rutgers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the Os.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did four passes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We compared with a standard pre-emergency
herbicide, which is PreFAR.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used PreFAR on three passes of the
robot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had Gold Tender right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly, four passes of the Os were
sufficient to significantly reduce the
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was at the same level of what you
would expect with a standard herbicide,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is Gold Tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was working well for controlling the
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big thing, and I mention it because
it's a big problem we still have to face
[SPEAKER_06]: with this kind of equipment, is that if
you're looking at the yield, if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at the KBH head weight,
clearly with four passes of the Os,
[SPEAKER_06]: we had a significant reduction in head
weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact is that it's mostly
associated with damage, mechanical damage,
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're getting when you keep running
this kind of equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if we have RTK, we still eat
basically the transplanted KBH.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got sufficient mechanical damage on
the KBH for causing a significant yield
[SPEAKER_06]: reduction right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we saw that with the Os only.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also saw it with the PreFAR herbicide
plus the robot.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're using just PreFAR, we didn't
see this kind of damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Herbicide didn't damage the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a trial that we did this year in
Sweetcorn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we were looking at pre-emergence
herbicide, pre- and post-emergence
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had two frequencies of use for the
robot equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had either bi-weekly, twice a month,
or weekly application.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we're using weekly application of
the Os, we are getting the same level of
[SPEAKER_06]: weight control as what we are getting from
a standard pre-emergence and
[SPEAKER_06]: post-emergence herbicide application
program.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some weeds that escaped the Os
robot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, this one, full panicom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with herbicide, it's a hard weed to
control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And clearly, this one, because it's
emerging late in the season, the Os didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: do such a good job at controlling this
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're looking at ear weight on the
airlines, clearly, I mean, Os application,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're looking right here at the weekly
application of the Os right here,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're the same ear weight as what you
will get from a standard herbicide
[SPEAKER_06]: application program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you're getting a bi-weekly,
definitely, bi-weekly was not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clearly, we need to have a frequent
almost weekly passage of this kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: technology if you want to get good weed
control.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, what is next with this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we want to get more autonomy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to try to use new tools that we
can integrate with this technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, there's two different types of
tools that I think will be interesting for
[SPEAKER_06]: us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn mentioned it in the introduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do significant work looking at cover
cropping in veggies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a hard time sometimes
establishing our cover crop between the
[SPEAKER_06]: rows of veggies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that using this kind of robot
may be something that if we are using it
[SPEAKER_06]: with a spreader, we can potentially start
seeding cover crops between the rows of
[SPEAKER_06]: crops in plastic culture system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the other one is that right here,
you have broccoli planted in red clover.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometime, you have significant
competition between the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_06]: the red clover, and the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are thinking that we had something
for mowing the red clover between the
[SPEAKER_06]: rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will significantly reduce the level of
competition due to the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to test potentially a mower for
reducing cover crop competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move to probably the most
exciting ones, which is really the laser
[SPEAKER_06]: weeder, which is work that Lynn and I did
last year, duplicated between New Jersey
[SPEAKER_06]: and Cornell, New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we worked with Travis Parker from
Carbon Robotics using this laser weeder
[SPEAKER_06]: platform coming straight from California.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Carbon Robotics was founded in 2018 on
its headquarter in Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_06]: The units are made in the US in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Early 2022, Carbon Robotics launched the
laser weeder targeting large vegetable
[SPEAKER_06]: grower states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Arizona, California, New Mexico,
Oregon, Washington, Idaho.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, this technology has been
mostly developed on the West Coast,
[SPEAKER_06]: not so much application, not so much
testing on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So laser weeders are on farms in at least
17 US states, including New York now,
[SPEAKER_06]: on three provinces in Canada, with
expansion into international markets to
[SPEAKER_06]: follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way it's working, I mean,
what we got here for testing was this,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would call it the research unit that was
their protocol, that was their protocol.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prototype, sorry, that they planned to
commercial.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, they evolved towards
something which is really attached to the
[SPEAKER_06]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the commercial units,
$1.6 million.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you can see in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some onion growers here, I forgot
their name.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Tories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got one unit as well in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the commercial unit which is
working with the tractors.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one was initially developed for fully
autonomous laser weeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the way they pursued.
[SPEAKER_06]: They decided to get with something which
is really attached to the tractor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we end up getting this one for
experimentation this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way it's working, a nice video
right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have artificial intelligence on
board, which is, I mean, you're projecting
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the light will really help the
artificial intelligence discriminating the
[SPEAKER_06]: crop on the weeds, identifying the weeds
versus the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: This system is directing lasers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see some of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see some smoke right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have weed detection, the laser
are specifically targeting the weeds and
[SPEAKER_06]: burning the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you see right here, right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impressive because you will see some
picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not touching the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really have excellent
discrimination between the crops on the
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't see any crop damage
associated with the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's quite impressive to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a picture of what it looks like when
you're using it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing you need to know is that
you need to use it on small seedlings.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that, yes, you need to
look at your crop when you're using this
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to know what is the size of your
weeds because that will determine the
[SPEAKER_06]: efficacy of the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right here, it's on broccoli.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that all the weeds that I
circled in here, all right here,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can see the burning of the growing
point on the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really targeting not the leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's targeting the growing point of the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really precise enough just to do
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here, you didn't see any damage on
the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing right here, looking at some of
the pea that I planted in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the peas right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these weeds are extremely close to
the pea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pea was not damaged.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, something which is interesting to
consider too is that the system will give
[SPEAKER_06]: higher priority for controlling smaller
weeds like this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because controlling a big, big weed,
it's not so big, but it's already big
[SPEAKER_06]: enough, for controlling a big weed like
this one, that will require too much
[SPEAKER_06]: energy for the system, too much time
spending on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are giving priority to controlling
the smaller weeds versus the bigger weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the bigger weeds, I mean,
you can always send a small crew to just
[SPEAKER_06]: hoe and remove some of these bigger weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a trial in New York on New
Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: We look at different crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we look at peas.
[SPEAKER_06]: We look at spinach.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn looked at beets as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had different treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had, of course, untreated weed check.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had pre-emergence herbicide in spinach.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had post-emergence herbicide in peas in
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had pre-herbicide followed by laser
weeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had laser weeding alone for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're looking at our pea trial
right here in New Jersey, you're looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at the weed density 14 days after the
second laser weeder pass.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did two laser weeder pass during the
season.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking right here at two different
types of herbicide, one which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: standard, pentazone, a pyridate that is
not labeled, but we wanted to use
[SPEAKER_06]: something different as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're looking right here at the
carbon robotic in blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the laser weeder, the carbon
robotic laser weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: And clearly, in terms of weed density,
we had the same level of weed density as
[SPEAKER_06]: what you would expect from the standard
herbicide, which is pentazone right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weed tree was cleaner, of course,
because we were manually weeding the
[SPEAKER_06]: plots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pyridate, not as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that we are investigating
it, but not such great control with this
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking at weed-fresh biomass at
harvest, again, excellent efficacy of the
[SPEAKER_06]: laser weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was really mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we found by this type of application
is that you just do two passes,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was sufficient to give you the same
level of control of what you will get with
[SPEAKER_06]: the standard herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you're looking at yield,
we collected the crop-fresh biomass at
[SPEAKER_06]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And clearly, what was really interesting
also to check is that we got the same
[SPEAKER_06]: level of crop-fresh biomass with a laser
weeder as compared to the weed tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was not the case with pentazone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if we get good weed control with
pentazone, this herbicide may still be
[SPEAKER_06]: causing damage to the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And later, it will translate into
crop-fresh biomass reduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So advantage of the laser weeder right
here is that, yes, you're getting the same
[SPEAKER_06]: level of weed control, but you don't get
herbicide injuries that may be associated
[SPEAKER_06]: with the herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're looking at the yield,
yes, I mean, we had significant yield
[SPEAKER_06]: difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the laser weeder was at the same
level of pea yield as a weed-free check.
[SPEAKER_06]: And more significant yield than what we
got with herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at spinach weed control right
here, same thing looking at weed-fresh
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass at harvest, excellent control with
the carbon robotics with the laser weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have basically any weeds left
over at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when you're looking at the yield
weight, what was interesting as well is
[SPEAKER_06]: that you had the same level of,
I mean, this spinach was weighing as much
[SPEAKER_06]: as what you would get in the weed-free.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right here, the dual herbicide plus
the carbon robotic laser weeder,
[SPEAKER_06]: we had lower yield on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that may be something that may
be related to crop damage caused by the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, that's something that Lynn
demonstrated in New York, where right
[SPEAKER_06]: here, you have herbicide, herbicide plus
carbon robotics on carbon robotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're looking at peas at beads,
sorry, on spinach, we definitely have
[SPEAKER_06]: lower emergence where you have herbicide
or herbicide plus carbon robotics plus
[SPEAKER_06]: laser weeder because this herbicide may
have significant effect on the emergence
[SPEAKER_06]: of the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really something interesting
with some things that we as weed
[SPEAKER_06]: scientists are not documenting enough on
that kind of experimentation when you can
[SPEAKER_06]: start to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so that was similar experimentation,
the crop stunting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, greater crop stunting in beads and
spinach associated with the use of the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's next for the laser weeder?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll continue laser weeder evaluation for
early season use in crops that can be
[SPEAKER_06]: sensitive to herbicide injury,
like beads and spinach.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for some high-value specialty
crops, like in my case, basil,
[SPEAKER_06]: that may be really something interesting
to test.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any herbicide in basil,
very few herbicide, very ineffective
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So using the laser weeder will be
something interesting to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: A brief overlook at some other novel
technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mentioned the Farm Engie Amiga.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what they already did at Clarel,
where they associated the Farm Engie
[SPEAKER_06]: platform, autonomous platform,
with a weed IT sprayer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So combining two of these technologies
together to get something fully
[SPEAKER_06]: autonomous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be working, and Lynn will be
working as well, with the Zasso Zap
[SPEAKER_06]: Weeder, which is using electricity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't develop it today because I didn't
do it, but Lynn did work with electricity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's something that we want to use
for vegetable crops, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: to get some smaller units for approach
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did some demonstration with autonomous
unit for weed control in grape.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see this one, that's a Nyoted,
fitted with finger weeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, you have some turning a
tip phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how fast it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty autonomous.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're controlling the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're walking on the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, you're getting some
training using some of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that we don't have on the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we'll get it anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a Vulcan autonomous weeder,
where actually you have cameras on board
[SPEAKER_06]: that are detecting the crop on actuating
some fingers, if you want, for killing the
[SPEAKER_06]: weed in the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what did we learn so far?
[SPEAKER_06]: These technologies does not necessarily
eliminate the need for herbicide,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially pre-emergence herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still need some of these herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're not eliminating all the
weeds, you may still need to get manual
[SPEAKER_06]: labor for controlling some of these weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some weeds will escape.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're always escaping.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will always be a place where the
weed will escape.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what selection pressure could we be
imparting with these technologies?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that for herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know it so much for this kind of
technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all alternative practices will be
compatible with new technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, I'm working with cover crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does cover crop will fit using some of
these new tools?
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know it yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really think that there is a role
for this tool, especially as companies are
[SPEAKER_06]: coming to the Northeast to test and modify
their equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we cannot place all the eggs in
the same basket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many questions that we need to
address before seeing full adoption of the
technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is the cost, not just the
cost of the unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The laser weeder is costing $1.6 million.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also need to get additional
services.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get GPS.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get RTK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about local support?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very high end technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have the capacity locally to provide
support for supporting this technology?
[SPEAKER_06]: Adaptability.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of these technologies have been
developed for the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different environment, different soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does it fit on the East Coast?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have weeds that are emerging on a much
more frequent basis than California,
[SPEAKER_06]: for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have much more rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does it fit for us on the East
Coast?
[SPEAKER_06]: Infrastructure and regulatory readiness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Operation on safety of transportation.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you transport some of these units?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you transport the laser weeder
here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any specific regulation that you
need to use?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm starting to talk to road girls
about using laser weeder, the next thing I
[SPEAKER_06]: know is that I will have people from road
girls telling me you have to be extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can damage your eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have all this kind of regulation as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cellular service, internet service,
base stations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to get all this service
available as well for using this new
[SPEAKER_06]: technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: On changing the nature of the labor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is high end technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not many people have been trained so
far for using this kind of technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I mean, we are living in
communities where people are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wind management is some things in
blueberry farm, veggie farm in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many people are still doing it manually.
[SPEAKER_06]: What will these people do if we start
getting this kind of technology widely
[SPEAKER_06]: available?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to start thinking to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So future studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be evaluating new autonomous robotic
platforms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I plan to work with the farm in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be working with electric weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just ordered a Zap weeder from Zasso.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be ordering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I order the XP coffee weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will be using the Zap weeder as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be continuing, if possible,
the response of laser weeding in high
[SPEAKER_06]: value annual crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are also planning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We already did some work in cranberries,
looking at hyperspectral imaging for weed
[SPEAKER_06]: detection.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to mention that Lynn has a
leading PI on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad Hanson, myself, and other wheat
scientists, we received a planning,
[SPEAKER_06]: a CRI planning grant in 2024 for
identifying the novel technology adoption
[SPEAKER_06]: barriers on drivers by surveying
stakeholders on a national basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my funding and acknowledgement over
the last few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, the dream team.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if we have time for any question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the Finger Lakes area,
a lot of vineyards will maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: underlying vegetation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious, for the blueberry farmers in
New Jersey, is the ideal weed management
[SPEAKER_03]: completely bare under the vines?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there room for some competition or
ground cover?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, for blueberry,
can we get some weeds growing under the
[SPEAKER_06]: blueberry bushes?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we tolerate that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer is no, mostly because
traditionally, I mean, yes, growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't want.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, our blueberry growers don't want
to see weeds in the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also because, as I mentioned,
we are growing blueberries in sandy soil
[SPEAKER_06]: with really low water retention capacity.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have weeds competing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a dryer, quickly enough,
you will see the blueberry bushes dying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a picture from a drought maybe
20 years ago where there's such high weed
[SPEAKER_06]: competition that the blueberry bushes were
dying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because yes, I mean, the water you're
providing even with drip irrigation will
[SPEAKER_06]: be benefiting the weeds, will even not be
absorbed by the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say it depends on the nature of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have soil here where you have
higher retention capacity.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us in blueberry, sandy soil,
so water is penetrating through the soil
[SPEAKER_06]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: On low organic matter content,
I mentioned that we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation, which I think we need to
change, because cultivating the ground is
[SPEAKER_06]: just depleting the organic matter over
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're combining both, definitely we
have soil that cannot keep the moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we're working on a project where
we are working trying to change things by
[SPEAKER_06]: growing cover crops between rows of
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big challenge is that, again,
you're working on acidic soil,
[SPEAKER_06]: on sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have so many cover crops that
can fit in this kind of condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're working on soil pH,
which is 4.5.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many, many cover crops will not just
grow well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're under this condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so that may be challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the machinery is so expensive,
how do small farmers and communities
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like a rental scheme?
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost of the technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think right now, yes, I mean,
you see adoption of some of these big
[SPEAKER_06]: technologies by big farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And truthfully, I think that for us in New
Jersey and probably as well in New York,
[SPEAKER_06]: as a smaller farm, they don't have the
capacity right now to adopt this
[SPEAKER_06]: technology as a farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they start to come together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they can provide sufficient funding
for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see two things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not every crop will be useful for
this kind of technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing the laser weeder, let's say,
in squash production, you don't make
[SPEAKER_06]: enough money.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is not enough profitability in
squash production for adopting this kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of high end technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the thing that may happen,
too, is that over the years, this kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: technology will keep evolving.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I expect that within the next 10
years, we'll start to see smaller units
[SPEAKER_06]: that can start to be affordable for
smaller farms like we have on the East
[SPEAKER_06]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this system has been fully
developed for giant farming operations in
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are coming here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are coming here to see us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And clearly, yes, maybe a few big farms
can adopt it on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the majority of the smaller farm,
they don't have the capacity of doing
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, if you're looking at,
yes, I mean, that's the case for laser
[SPEAKER_06]: weeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking at the NIO OZ robot that
I was showing, it's $70,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can have small organic farming
operation, a very small farm, where they
[SPEAKER_06]: can start considering buying this kind of
technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because yes, I mean, it's effective for
weed control.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be really effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have a steep learning curve
with some of this technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: The NIO OZ, I show you the slide where,
actually, you have good weed control,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you're getting so much crop damage
that you need to learn to use this tool as
[SPEAKER_06]: well to make sure that maybe you can
generate a little bit of crop competition
[SPEAKER_06]: if you don't get too many crop damage at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to mention the cost of the
Amiga and the out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you booted, so you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Terry was saying, yeah, the laser
weeder is definitely an outlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have two units in New York,
and we have two more ordered by growers in
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some very high value large
farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the Amiga, I think the Amiga runs
about $15,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it starts to enter a range where it
does become more affordable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are companies that are building
smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: More affordable units.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also, there are some people
who have a push for open source systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guy Coleman out of Australia has built an
open weed locator, which is basically an
[SPEAKER_05]: open source vision guided system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that runs about $400.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're just going to have to be
extremely talented with building it,
[SPEAKER_05]: building your own spray system.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is kind of this potential to
minimize the cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Terry said, more companies are
entering the market, even in the laser
[SPEAKER_05]: weeder market, using different lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the cost is expected to drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing too, when you are talking about
the cost, is that you have the cost of the
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you need to get all, this technology,
it's not just putting fuel in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get access to RTK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get access to GPS.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need, in some case, to get bus base
station for the Amiga, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get these other services as
well that sometimes may not be available.
[SPEAKER_06]: In New Jersey, in the Pine Barrens,
I don't have Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have some good cell phone service.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I don't have it on my own cell
phone, I know that this kind of system
[SPEAKER_06]: will not be working as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to consider too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'll be there at some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing too, I mean, I didn't
mention it, that many of these
[SPEAKER_06]: technologies, they are excellent
engineers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are not plant biologists.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys saying that they are coming
with new equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be working great under these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know what are the conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a tendency, it's changing,
but they have a tendency of working as a
[SPEAKER_06]: company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't always come to see us,
University Extension people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's starting to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw that last.
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: But initially, it was mostly driven by
engineers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not have the focus on a cropping
system, on weed management, on weed
[SPEAKER_06]: ecology, weed biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not be familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something that you need to
integrate, especially here on the East
[SPEAKER_06]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because our condition, I mean,
California, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have rain, you don't have
weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different challenge.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you notice the laser reader?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you notice the difference in
performance when it was reading annuals
[SPEAKER_02]: versus perennials?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't see the difference because we
didn't have perennials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, we have nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Lynn can talk about the nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's something that, yes,
definitely is interesting to check.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you may make the assumption that
the nutsedge, it's a tuber.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can kill the one which is a merge.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you still have sprouting that may be
coming from the tuber.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, did we see something on this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we had regrowth of nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We killed some small ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the whole, what do we leave
behind?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wins?
[SPEAKER_05]: And perennials are going to be,
no matter what system we use, perennials
[SPEAKER_05]: are probably going to rise to the top of
the winner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for nutsedge, because we are
working on annual crops, nutsedge,
[SPEAKER_06]: what will be important is that if you're
looking at the ecology of nutsedge,
[SPEAKER_06]: at some point during the season,
May, July, the nutsedge will turn to our
[SPEAKER_06]: production of new nuts, new tubers for
next year, instead of producing new
[SPEAKER_06]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of weed competition,
if you can get the nutsedge at least under
[SPEAKER_06]: control up to May, July, we tend to see
that you will be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because basically, you don't have many
clonal population coming from the nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's something that,
yes, I mean, you may still get regrowth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least you will not get the giant
clonal patches of nutsedge that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: get if you leave it uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the application of
either the lasers or some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: tech in more of an agronomic setting?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a question for Vipan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know for, I think for the laser
weeder on Vipan, tell me if you think
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the laser weeder is really well
adapted for specialty crops, because
[SPEAKER_06]: they're also high value crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you make enough money?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need many of these agronomic crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they still have been a huge
diversity of herbicides that they can use.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are not as limited as what we are in
specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they may not have the same need for
laser weeding than we have in specialty
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what they have in agronomic crops,
the targeted application that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioning before, Blue River,
for example, they have this kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: targeted application where clearly they
will still rely on herbicide, but they
[SPEAKER_06]: will really rely on a lower rate of
herbicide because of more precise
[SPEAKER_06]: application.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think, I don't know Vipan,
but I don't think that the laser weeder,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not something which is explored for
agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all depends on the cost of the
technology, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The value of the crop, the high value
crops, where you can spend one and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, I mean, we folks have changed four
or five months officially.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The laser weeder is also much slower than
if you went to Blue River's talk last
[SPEAKER_05]: week, they were going what, 10 miles an
hour?
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: The laser weeder is not doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't cover the acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: But leafy greens, they can cover the
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into the future, that is in the
future, maybe in the future we'll see
[SPEAKER_06]: units that can go faster as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the graduate students here,
there is a lunch provided with Dr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bisousom in 413.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have questions for Terry,
you can reach out to him via email.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can put you in touch with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Terry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are looking forward to 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are already planning the projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it's getting exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
