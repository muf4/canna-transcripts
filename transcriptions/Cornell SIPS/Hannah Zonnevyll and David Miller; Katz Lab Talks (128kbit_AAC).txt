[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is my pleasure to introduce Hannah
Zonneville, who is a second year PhD
[SPEAKER_07]: student here in Soil and Crop Sciences.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hannah got her bachelor's degree from the
University of Michigan, where she worked
[SPEAKER_07]: on topics including moose herbivory in
northern forests.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hannah then went on to live and work in
Chicago for two years, where she worked
[SPEAKER_07]: for an environmental education nonprofit,
and also was a community science fellow
[SPEAKER_07]: with the American Geophysical Union.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in SIPPS, Hannah has served as the
Graduate Student Council Chair,
[SPEAKER_07]: the Soil and Crop Sciences Graduate
Student Assembly Vice President,
[SPEAKER_07]: and as a representative on the SIPPS TDI
Council.
[SPEAKER_07]: She also regularly leads outreach
activities and finds ways to create broad
[SPEAKER_07]: and inclusive science-focused communities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today Hannah will be telling us about her
dissertation research, which is supported
[SPEAKER_07]: by an NSF Graduate Student Fellowship.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please join me in welcoming Hannah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for that kind introduction,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I haven't met you yet, my name is
Hannah, and I am a PhD student with Dan.
[SPEAKER_08]: And today I'm super excited to share with
you all the work that I've been doing
[SPEAKER_08]: since coming to Cornell, which is
leveraging remote sensing to quantify
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen production across space and time
for Juniper's ashy eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I jump into the nitty gritty of my
project, I wanted to first give you a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of background about me.
[SPEAKER_08]: As Dan mentioned, I hail from the great
state of Michigan, where I attended the
[SPEAKER_08]: University of Michigan and fell in love
with plant ecology through a series of
[SPEAKER_08]: undergraduate experiences there.
[SPEAKER_08]: After graduating, I wanted to do some more
community-focused work, and so I did an
[SPEAKER_08]: AmeriCorps service here in Chicago with an
environmental education nonprofit that
[SPEAKER_08]: partners with Chicago public schools to
bring a comprehensive, free-of-charge,
[SPEAKER_08]: outdoor STEM education to students from
low-income households.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was during this experience that I
saw firsthand how the systemic racism in
[SPEAKER_08]: the US leads to really awful inequities in
terms of educational opportunities,
[SPEAKER_08]: access to nature, and ultimately public
health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when I was thinking about returning
to graduate school, I wanted to find a way
[SPEAKER_08]: to unite these two passions and ultimately
do work that could help alleviate some of
[SPEAKER_08]: the public health burdens that I was
witnessing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is what brought me to the CATS
lab here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we focus on plant-related public
health problems, and the one that I focus
[SPEAKER_08]: on specifically is that of airborne
pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who among us has pollen allergies?
[SPEAKER_08]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Misery loves company, and you are not
alone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is actually estimated that over 80
million people in the United States have
[SPEAKER_08]: seasonal allergies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the worst that most of you will suffer
are a runny nose, maybe trouble sleeping
[SPEAKER_08]: for a few weeks out of the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for people with chronic respiratory
issues, these asthma allergies and
[SPEAKER_08]: subsequent pollen exposures can be
dangerous and result in emergency
[SPEAKER_08]: department visits due to asthma
exacerbation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also know that asthma is not
equally distributed across the United
[SPEAKER_08]: States.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty of research that shows that
asthma is in a higher concentrations
[SPEAKER_08]: within communities that are lower income.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I have additional bad news,
and that is that pollen exposure is
[SPEAKER_08]: increasing with climate change.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing that the increased
temperatures are leading to a longer
[SPEAKER_08]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're seeing here is the consecutive
days above freezing, which is a really bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also the case that the climate change
allows plants to start releasing pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: earlier in the year and then continue
later into the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also resulting in range expansion for
different allergenic species.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something we're seeing in common
ragweed in Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a recent meta analysis done in the
CATS lab showed that plants are able to
[SPEAKER_08]: allocate more carbon to reproductive
structures under increased carbon
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's a variety of mechanisms
that climate change is increasing pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: exposure and therefore possibly impacting
downstream public health effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucky for us, as with most things,
science has the potential to offer a
[SPEAKER_08]: solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this solution can look like better
airborne pollen forecast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Airborne pollen forecast can help people
know when they might be exposed to pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: such that they can take their allergy
medications with enough time prior to
[SPEAKER_08]: exposure so that it reaches its full
efficacy by time that they are exposed to
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can also let people know when to turn
on their air filters or help them avoid
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen hot spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, current predictions of airborne
pollen are insufficient to help people
[SPEAKER_08]: avoid this exposure.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're seeing here is some work done
by Dan that shows the predicted airborne
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen concentration from commercial
forecasters compared to the empirically
[SPEAKER_08]: measured pollen concentration from pollen
monitoring stations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so pollen.com is doing all right,
but the rest of them leave a little bit of
[SPEAKER_08]: room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you are associated with any of
these companies, I'm not smack talking,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just inviting you to fund me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, you might be asking,
well, why is it that current airborne
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen is modeled so poorly?
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the key reasons for this is
because we just don't really know how much
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen is being produced across space and
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: The current method for measuring airborne
pollen is through a sparsely populated
[SPEAKER_08]: network of airborne pollen monitoring
stations.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are only about 50 in the contiguous
US.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it does a really bad job of
capturing the spatiotemporal variation in
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen production.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is really difficult to calculate
the amount of pollen being produced based
[SPEAKER_08]: on ecology of plants because it's super
hard to study how plant reproduction
[SPEAKER_08]: varies over large spatial extents.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, the historical way of
doing this is manual measurements that
[SPEAKER_08]: take a very long time and actually can
limit studies that involve counting these
[SPEAKER_08]: reproductive structures on plants to
sample sizes of only 10 to hundreds of
[SPEAKER_08]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And further, it only covers a small
portion of the tree and a small portion of
[SPEAKER_08]: the range of these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucky for us, we live in the time of
remote sensing, which is an amazing tool
[SPEAKER_08]: in our toolbox that we can use to study
ecological processes across the entire
[SPEAKER_08]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's been plenty of literature in
the past couple of years that uses aerial
[SPEAKER_08]: images to track the timing of plant
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it has been positive that we could
perhaps use aerial images such as with
[SPEAKER_08]: drones or with satellite images to
quantify the number of reproductive
[SPEAKER_08]: structures on plants such that we could
calculate pollen production that we could
[SPEAKER_08]: use to inform these better airborne pollen
models.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you can probably guess, my research
focuses on one central theme, which is
[SPEAKER_08]: building better airborne pollen models.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have just proved to you all that this
could definitely help public health
[SPEAKER_08]: outcomes and improve the way that people
interact with plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in order to do this, we need to have a
better understanding of pollen production
[SPEAKER_08]: across space and time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to help do this, I have designed three
chapters to pursue here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one is to actually measure the
amount of pollen production over space and
[SPEAKER_08]: time using remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next is to build off of the data
collected in chapter one to then start to
[SPEAKER_08]: disentangle the abiotic drivers of plant
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is possible because the chapter one
data set will let us quantify the number
[SPEAKER_08]: of reproductive structures on plants that
we can pair with gridded environmental
[SPEAKER_08]: data and start to model what might be the
dominant drivers of plant reproduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my third chapter, I hope to take a
ecological forecasting approach and
[SPEAKER_08]: actually try to predict how climate change
might affect future pollen production of
[SPEAKER_08]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a similar approach that has been
done in phenology but has not yet been
[SPEAKER_08]: done for pollen production.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to spend most of my time today
talking about chapter one, since that is
[SPEAKER_08]: what I have worked the most on so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will also give you a little teaser
into chapter two towards the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd now like to introduce you to my
study species, the beautiful ash juniper
[SPEAKER_08]: or Juniperus ashii.
[SPEAKER_08]: Juniperus ashii is an evergreen dioecious
plant that is the dominant tree species
[SPEAKER_08]: along in central Texas where it thrives on
the calcareous soil of the Edwards
[SPEAKER_08]: Plateau.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is known by locals as an infamous
producer of pollen that causes something
[SPEAKER_08]: known as cedar fever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cedar fever is an awful affliction
that results in severe runny noses,
[SPEAKER_08]: achy joints, trouble sleeping.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can actually even cause some people
to run a fever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the culprit of cedar fever is the
super abundant number of reproductive
[SPEAKER_08]: structures on these plants, which are
pollen cones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Male individuals can actually contain up
to 1.3 million pollen cones on a single
[SPEAKER_08]: tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And each of these cones can have almost
half a million grains of pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this pollen is so abundant and so
allergenic that past work in the system
[SPEAKER_08]: has revealed that it can contribute up to
18% of asthma-related emergency department
[SPEAKER_08]: visits during peak pollen season.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, you can see the pollen coming off
of these trees in waves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is, from personal experience,
very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the thing that makes ash juniper a
horrible neighbor to all of the Texans
[SPEAKER_08]: actually makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it a wonderful study species for
me because the pollen cones have very
[SPEAKER_08]: distinct visual properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can probably tell, this individual,
which is a male with pollen cones,
[SPEAKER_08]: looks quite different from this
individual, which is a female,
[SPEAKER_08]: having no pollen cones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's take a little bit of a closer
look at these cones.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have this kind of beautiful orange
color that makes them stand out against
[SPEAKER_08]: the green foliage that you can see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it is this aspect of the ash
juniper that makes it observable from
[SPEAKER_08]: aerial imagery.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, I have been trying to derive
methods that use aerial images from drones
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as manual methods to quantify the
number of cones on these trees using their
[SPEAKER_08]: spectral properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd now like to show you a little bit
more about what those methods look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to test my methodology, I have
established 14 study sites across the
[SPEAKER_08]: range of the ash juniper trees in central
Texas.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that the study sites cover a
range of environmental conditions,
[SPEAKER_08]: including temperature, precipitation,
and what is displayed here is soil
[SPEAKER_08]: moisture data from SMAP.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at each site, I choose between five to
10 focal trees on which I take a
[SPEAKER_08]: comprehensive suite of measurements.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I take additional phenology
measurements from surrounding trees to try
[SPEAKER_08]: to understand how the timing of
reproduction varies among these trees and
[SPEAKER_08]: how that might impact the spectral reading
from the images.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have done this for two field seasons
now, which I go to Texas in January.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a nice little escape from Ithaca
winter.
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, that seems to last
until mid-April anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was also very lucky this past field
season to be joined by a wonderful UT
[SPEAKER_08]: grad, Dr. Annalisa Shields Estrada,
who was not only a really hard worker,
[SPEAKER_08]: but an absolute joy to be around.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really grateful for her help on
this project.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to show you a little bit more about
the methods in practice, I first select my
[SPEAKER_08]: focal trees at each study site and take a
couple of manual measurements.
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, this included the diameter at
breast height and the height.
[SPEAKER_08]: I then put a quadrat with a known area on
a branch of the tree so that it's facing
[SPEAKER_08]: upward and visible by the drone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after I fly the drone, I harvest all
of the foliage that falls within that
[SPEAKER_08]: known area of the quadrat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I use a super sophisticated method
for homogenizing it, where I run it
[SPEAKER_08]: through a mulcher.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that enables me to have a
representative sample where I can
[SPEAKER_08]: subsample the foliage 10 times,
take its weight, and count.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this will give me the number of cones
per grams of foliage that I can then
[SPEAKER_08]: multiply to the number of cones per grams
of foliage for the entire tree by using
[SPEAKER_08]: alimetric equations based on diameter at
breast height and height to give me the
[SPEAKER_08]: total gram of foliage for the tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these are all my manual methods,
but we're not done yet because we now get
[SPEAKER_08]: to do some fun remote sensing things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from the drone images, I find the
quadrats, crop that down so that it only
[SPEAKER_08]: contains pixel values that fall within
that known area.
[SPEAKER_08]: I then extract all of the pixel values
from that image and correlate these pixel
[SPEAKER_08]: values, their red, green, and blue values,
to the known quantity of cones that I just
[SPEAKER_08]: estimated using my manual methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: This results in an index that can be used
to predict the number of cones per grams
[SPEAKER_08]: based solely on the red, green,
and blue values.
[SPEAKER_08]: So having this index allows us to extend
our measurements of these reproductive
[SPEAKER_08]: structures beyond just the focal trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd now like to show you the index.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what I am provisionally calling
the orange-ness index.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any other recommendations,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is a combination of the red and
green values, red minus green over red
[SPEAKER_08]: plus green.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you can see here on the y-axis,
we have cone density.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is the manually estimated
cones that I used with my subsampling.
[SPEAKER_08]: And higher cone density results in a
higher index value because there are more
[SPEAKER_08]: cones in the picture, more red values,
more positive value.
[SPEAKER_08]: Compared to this quadra over here that has
very few cones and a very low cone
[SPEAKER_08]: density, has a lot more green values
associated and therefore returns a lower
[SPEAKER_08]: index value.
[SPEAKER_08]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our index.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does it look like when you actually
apply it to images?
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're seeing here is a quadrat
picture that I have processed to only
[SPEAKER_08]: retain the pixel values that are either
foliage or cone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use a random forest pixel classifier.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the results down here,
but it performs very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when you apply the index to this,
you can see that the positive values do
[SPEAKER_08]: indeed match up with where the cones are.
[SPEAKER_08]: For visualization purposes, I just created
a binary.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the positive values associated with
cones are orange.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the green values associated with a
foliage are negative and green.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so yeah, you can see that it works
pretty well and does a good job of picking
[SPEAKER_08]: up the distinct properties of these cones.
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember that the overall goal is to
use this index to count cones from trees
[SPEAKER_08]: that we don't actually have the manual
measurements on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's try to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you are seeing a subset of an
orthomosaic image from the drone,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is basically just a stitched
together landscape level picture that I
[SPEAKER_08]: put together all of the pictures from a
drone at a study site.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see the varying densities of
cones on these trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some with a lot higher density
compared to some here with lower density.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I've done is manually segmented
these tree tops so that we can only retain
[SPEAKER_08]: pixel values that fall within the canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once again, I can extract the pixel
values here and run it through the pixel
[SPEAKER_08]: classifier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apply the index.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, the lower values are associated
with more foliage and the higher values
[SPEAKER_08]: are associated with a higher cone density.
[SPEAKER_08]: From here, we have all of the ingredients
that we need to actually go ahead and
[SPEAKER_08]: quantify the number of reproductive
structures and therefore the pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: production of these trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can, again, calculate the total
grams of foliage for these trees using
[SPEAKER_08]: alimetric equations where the grams of
foliage is a function of the diameter at
[SPEAKER_08]: best height and height.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we can take the average pixel
value or the average index value from
[SPEAKER_08]: these trees, multiply it by the grams of
foliage from the alimetric equations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this can give us the number of cones
per tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Using this, we can calculate the pollen
produced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this can all go back into creating
better airborne pollen forecasts based on
[SPEAKER_08]: a more comprehensive measure of the amount
of pollen being produced.
[SPEAKER_08]: So well, I am definitely very excited
about these methods and my work so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty of limitations and it's not
perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some limitations that have been difficult
to work through are that the trees have a
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of a wide variety of coloring in
their foliage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you can see here, this is a tree
that has a lot more yellow foliage rather
[SPEAKER_08]: than green.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's returning a really high index
value despite there not being very many
[SPEAKER_08]: cones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Further, the index is sensitive to
lighting conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we have pictures that are either
very overexposed or very shadowy,
[SPEAKER_08]: the index is not able to do a very good
job of calculating the number or
[SPEAKER_08]: predicting the number of cones based just
on the spectral properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, it has been difficult to
calibrate the index using coarser
[SPEAKER_08]: resolution images from the drone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm still working out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some kinks there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I'm thinking about next steps,
there's a lot that I am looking forward to
[SPEAKER_08]: working on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first, I plan to create alimetric
equations that are specifically using
[SPEAKER_08]: remote sensing variables.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what these trees look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is really not that fun to take the
diameter at breast height of these trees
[SPEAKER_08]: and also probably not that useful because
it is not a variable that's observable
[SPEAKER_08]: from aerial images.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I plan to use LIDAR in the coming field
season to create better alimetric
[SPEAKER_08]: equations that rely on variables such as
height and canopy diameter instead of
[SPEAKER_08]: diameter at breast height.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will save me a lot of time and a
lot of being stabbed in the eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And next, these trees, as I think with all
other trees, are 3D objects.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they contain a lot of information on
the sides of the trees that are missed
[SPEAKER_08]: from aerial images.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to account for the number of cones that
are hidden from aerial images,
[SPEAKER_08]: I've taken some orbital flights around my
focal trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I plan to create a conversion factor
for the number of cones that are missed
[SPEAKER_08]: when just looking at the trees from the
top down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, and this is kind of like my big push
right now, is to figure out ways to adjust
[SPEAKER_08]: for different lighting conditions again,
you're seeing here a quadrat picture that
[SPEAKER_08]: is just in a lot of shadows.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the index doesn't really know what's
going on with the number of cones that it
[SPEAKER_08]: is seeing here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have any kind of workflow that
you've used in your research, I'd be very
[SPEAKER_08]: happy to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully, I can find a workaround for
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, one next step that is feeling
especially exciting to me is scaling up to
[SPEAKER_08]: satellite images using the index to be
able to measure cone production and pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: production across much larger spatial and
temporal extents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this would allow us to get a more
comprehensive data set across central
[SPEAKER_08]: Texas at the regional level rather than
just being limited to the study sites that
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm able to visit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to now bring us back to where we
started.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've shown you so far how we can better
measure pollen production across large
[SPEAKER_08]: spatial and temporal extents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now that we can measure it,
how can we use this information and pair
[SPEAKER_08]: it with existing environmental data to
start to understand what the abiotic
[SPEAKER_08]: drivers of reproduction might be that
drive variation in reproduction across
[SPEAKER_08]: space and time?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is very new data that is more of a
proof of concept than anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what you're seeing here is the mean
index value from my sites compared with
[SPEAKER_08]: the mean soil moisture data from SMAP.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is this kind of workflow that I
hope to use in my second chapter to
[SPEAKER_08]: compare the reproductive output with
gridded environmental data sets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, reproduction is an incredibly
complex process that will require much
[SPEAKER_08]: more sophisticated statistical tools such
as hierarchical modeling to start to
[SPEAKER_08]: uncover what is driving the variability
and reproduction in these trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I'm excited to explore this in
my coming years at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So key takeaways.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you remember nothing else from this
presentation, my name is Hannah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I have just shown you that we
can measure pollen production over these
[SPEAKER_08]: large spatial extents using aerial images,
which will allow us to create better
[SPEAKER_08]: airborne pollen forecasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is part of my chapter one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we can also use the data set
collected here to start to explore the
[SPEAKER_08]: abiotic drivers of the variability and
reproduction for these trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this will be part of my chapter two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you will just have to stay tuned for
chapter three.
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, I'd like to thank everyone who
made this work possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything we're doing is in the presence
of others.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm so grateful for everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only the people listed on this slide,
but just to be in community with you all
[SPEAKER_08]: has been a real joy at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll take questions now or later.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious, how did you arrive at
your sort of orange-ness conducts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you try other sort of indices?
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried a lot of indices, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of looking through the
literature and seeing what other people
[SPEAKER_08]: have used.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we arrived at the orange-ness index
just kind of by way of it being what seems
[SPEAKER_08]: the most feasible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the cones are so orange,
we thought that maybe because there would
[SPEAKER_08]: be more red values associated with those
cones compared to the green values,
[SPEAKER_08]: that would be the best combination of
bands to actually pick up on those
[SPEAKER_08]: differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, definitely still could possibly
change.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's what's worked the best so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, is there hope to maybe
the answer will come when you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: information on chapter two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there hope to kind of do a survey
one year and then run with that
[SPEAKER_00]: information for several years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it's going to be
something that has to be done?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, how often?
[SPEAKER_08]: How often for data collection?
[SPEAKER_08]: I plan to do three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the idea is that if we could scale up
to satellite images, this would enable me
[SPEAKER_08]: to not actually go down and collect the
data but have a longer time series both
[SPEAKER_08]: back into before I started at Cornell and
then when I don't have to go down anymore
[SPEAKER_08]: and kind of using that information as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks again, Hannah, for a wonderful
talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to introduce Dr. Dave Miller
next.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave is a postdoc working with me here on
soil and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he did his undergrad at Boston
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he got a master's and PhD from UC
Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_07]: He then went on to do a postdoc at UC
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the topics of the work for his
dissertation and for his first postdoc
[SPEAKER_07]: were about trees and cities and using
remote sensing to understand the effects
[SPEAKER_07]: of drought on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: His work from these was published in
journals, including Nature Communications
[SPEAKER_07]: and Remote Sensing of Environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been very fortunate to lure Dave
away from sunny California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he has been instrumental in this
transdisciplinary collaboration,
[SPEAKER_07]: the Cool Trees team, which is working to
understand how we can use trees to keep
[SPEAKER_07]: cities cool during heat waves and
ultimately reduce heat related morbidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been very fortunate to have Dave
here and to benefit from his expertise in
[SPEAKER_07]: remote sensing and in making beautiful
maps.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please join me in welcoming Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dan, for that kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And welcome, everyone, to our second of
two talks today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough act to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm going to be talking a lot
about New York City and classifying urban
[SPEAKER_01]: tree species using a lot of high
resolution satellite time series for heat
[SPEAKER_01]: related public health impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our co-authors here are at
Cornell in civil engineering and also at
[SPEAKER_01]: Weill Cornell in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll kind of get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tree species vary in cooling capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how can we use this to actually reduce
heat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who's walked under different types
of trees in your neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_01]: a big maple tree is going to provide a lot
more shade, a lot more cooling than
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps a smaller cherry tree would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so tree species actually cool
differently in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these differences aren't really
included in models for heat and human
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure health related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shading, for example, tree size,
of course, and leaf area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many leaves do you have on this
particular tree?
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has to do with transpiration
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much water can these trees actually
pump into the air to cool things down over
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Smodal density, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's differences across species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these aren't really included in tree
selection decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most you'll probably get from these
sort of things is how big is this tree
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to get in the way of power
lines or something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, is this tree actually going to
survive in this location?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of a lot of these species
level differences, we don't really have
[SPEAKER_01]: that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't really have good information
about what trees are where in the city of
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some information, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have information about where
they all are, which is really needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce heat and health impacts more
precisely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maps of tree taxa are really needed to
reduce heat more precisely in cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of this, we can actually
estimate cooling at a scale that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant to urban residents.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're thinking about a large
neighborhood area, a lot of this health
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis is done at census blocks or
census block groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be shady and cool in one part of
the neighborhood, but not the other part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're walking down the street
in your particular part of town,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't have many trees in your
street, what does it matter that that park
[SPEAKER_01]: has tons of trees just down the road?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are many methods from remote
sensing to do tree identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting down to genus and species
level stuff is just pretty hard in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big issue is that mid-summer,
you may have experienced this yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green trees kind of all look the same,
especially from multispectral images like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the satellite data we actually
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at certain times of year, trees can
look very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to show you one of the few
windows in Bradfield Hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan took a bunch of these pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can see here is that these
are a few different times of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So summer on the top left, these all look
pretty green.
[SPEAKER_01]: But spring, early fall, late fall,
they look kind of different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at this particular
tree, over here, well, it's turning
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow, while other trees are senescing a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one over here, it's not quite the
same color as the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps they're different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can lean on this type of
information to get at different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: seasonality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we use deciduous phenology to
classify trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: And by phenology, I mean the seasonal
timing of different events in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of deciduous trees,
when do they put out leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do they lose leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this timing differ year to year
in between species?
[SPEAKER_01]: So urban trees have been classified for
multiple seasonal images recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take a big stack of satellite data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw that all into a big classifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do pretty well with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what there haven't been before is that
classifications based on the time series
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually derives the phenological
dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is a precise date you could give
to a model to say, oh, what is the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the start of spring?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do is we're aiming to
identify taxonomic differences at fine
[SPEAKER_01]: timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can do that with time scales,
which all sounds well and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, getting the data to do this
is not the most straightforward thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some data requirements to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big trade-offs a lot of the
time with satellite imagery is different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of resolutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, you can get pretty good temporal
resolution, so lots of observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pixels have to be pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're dealing with something that
you want to get lots of precise
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements, you need high spatial
resolution as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fortunately, Planet is a commercial
satellite company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a constellation of
satellites called PlanetScope that both
[SPEAKER_01]: has high spatial, roughly three meters,
and high temporal resolution imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get observations almost every
single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they get around this is by
launching hundreds of these small sats
[SPEAKER_01]: that take observations pretty often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do that and lean on that to look
at individual trees and their seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also need good labeled training
data to actually predict on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do a classification without
having some good training data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, the city of New York has
tree STEM and ID database from a street
[SPEAKER_01]: tree database where people literally went
out and hugged a million trees in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: City and labeled them with different genus
levels, cultivar, quality status of the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's still less than 20% of the
total number of trees in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still a lot of places that need
to be filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you need a good tree crown
polygon data set, because you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: need an object that you're putting a label
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're just doing pixels,
and it could be pretty noisy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thankfully, there's already been
classification of tree crown polygons from
[SPEAKER_01]: city-wide LIDAR flights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to make polygons ourselves from
LIDAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're thankful that this data set
already exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the research goals from this,
examining the differences, the first step
[SPEAKER_01]: in this, and examining the differences in
urban tree phenology by TAXA in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the main research questions for
this is, how can satellite-based phenology
[SPEAKER_01]: be used to actually separate urban
deciduous tree TAXA in New York City?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key things to keep in mind,
and why we're getting away with this
[SPEAKER_01]: technique in a place like New York,
is that it's mostly deciduous trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: like over 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were doing this in a place with a
lot more evergreen trees, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, Seattle or Miami, you'd have a
lot harder time doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this may not be the best technique for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other questions, temporal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the year to year variability of
spring leaf out, in terms of the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: season, among different trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some types of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also spatial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does spring leaf out very spatially
across the city?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're a tree in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a real go-getter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You leaf out early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trees in Brooklyn, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have to just take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to look at the end of
season, but it's going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example of tree data in
Flatbush, Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit south of Prospect
Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's cool about this neighborhood is
that you have a lot of single-family homes
[SPEAKER_01]: with trees, individually, across this sort
of central neighborhood, but larger
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment blocks over on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big differences in the amount of tree
cover you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of these colored points is a
street tree that Parks and Rec Department
[SPEAKER_01]: actually labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so different colors by different tree
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of these points,
which is awesome, but there's still a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of places that are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what this tree polygon data set
looks like on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from the Nature Conservancy
and the University of Vermont Spatial
[SPEAKER_01]: Analysis Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this data set is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we can actually put labels to all
these trees for the places that are
[SPEAKER_01]: missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we actually get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this map of tree stems from the
New York City Parks and Rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we want is a final map of all the
trees labeled in New York City,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we actually get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We use this PlanetScope satellite time
series, LIDAR TreeCom polygons and
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, and also air temperature data
to look at what time of year should trees
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf out based on accumulated?
[SPEAKER_01]: How warm is this different place in the
city?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for each tree crown polygon,
extract this time series of reflectance
[SPEAKER_01]: from PlanetScope reflectance time series,
clean this up, extract key phenology data,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also LIDAR structural variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how tall is the tree?
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is the crown?
[SPEAKER_01]: How dense is the canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And air temperature related data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have this suite of different
information all for this individual tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can use the labels of tree stems
from the New York City Parks and Rec as
[SPEAKER_01]: our reference training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And validation data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the trees we know what they are
and where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can use that and develop a
classifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm using random forest to classify
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apply that classifier to all the
unknown tree polygons across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ta-da, we have New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: All completed for a final map of trees in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to talk mostly about this
part up here in terms of actually how we
[SPEAKER_01]: get the phenology information out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's from the National Agricultural
Imagery Program, NAEP.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've looked at any agricultural data,
you may be familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it in New York City as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a true color air photo from
summer 2019, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they only do this every couple of
years and right in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't get much seasonality out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is PlanetScope, which is slightly
coarser resolution, but much more
[SPEAKER_01]: observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing it in the false color
composite near infrared red green with
[SPEAKER_01]: near infrared on the red display.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants reflect way more light in the
near infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything that you see on this map
is bright red.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's normally green plants that you
would see with your naked eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's phenology time series of a
particular oak tree, a very charismatic
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's well-behaved in the South
Bronx.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what it is in the NAEP imagery
on the top left from the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this particular tree, I'm showing
the PlanetScope imagery down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a time series of NDVI through
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see as it gets bright red in
the spring, that's when it's greening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what we're tracking for
every single one of these tree crowned
[SPEAKER_01]: polygons across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the actual value we're tracking is the
NDVI, which is a very common satellite
[SPEAKER_01]: remote sensing index where you're
comparing the near infrared to the red.
[SPEAKER_01]: As this number gets higher, the plants are
greener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can track this year over year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, for all the trees that we
know, what they're labeled, this is for
[SPEAKER_01]: all the maples in New York City for 2018
from PlanetScope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, you can see a lot of these are
toward the first week of May, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do this year over year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have approximate timing of
leaf-out variability across every single
[SPEAKER_01]: year that we have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice there's some year-to-year
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, 2019 and 2022 tend to be a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can see is that when we can
separate this out further, you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: down to species level as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, silver maple in the middle
here tends to be a little bit later than
[SPEAKER_01]: red maple or Norway maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some different species level
differences we can get at as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do this for other genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, here is platanus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're plane trees or sycamores.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you'll notice about this one is,
A, it tends to be a lot later than the
[SPEAKER_01]: maples, which is reassuring because they
probably should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also this year, 2019, is super duper
late.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at late May for this
tree, which is suspiciously late in some
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we actually translate phenology
into a classification?
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to keep in mind is that this is
one particular year in 2019 and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: just separated by a different genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is different months in the
spring, box plots showing the distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: of timing for the trees that we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, based on this,
we could do a pretty good job separating
[SPEAKER_01]: Glittitsia, the honey locust, from Acer or
maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting back to platanus, it's way,
way later than everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we should be able to
readily separate this genus based on its
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent late spring leaf out in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we think is going on is that there is
an anthropomorphic fracnose fungus causing
[SPEAKER_01]: delayed spring leaf out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fungus that causes the plants to
attempt to leaf out in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it looks like they have frost damage
or leaf wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaves kind of shrivel up and
don't look that happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trees look bare until much later in the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they get their act together by the
end of May and summer goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can do is that for an example
test case on a classification,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can lean on this and a few other
structural variables from the lidar and do
[SPEAKER_01]: a prototype classification for the bronx.
[SPEAKER_01]: For platanus versus other genera,
just a split.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get like a 93% overall accuracy
in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big points that you see on here are
the actual labeled street tree stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything else, we label it as
either platanus or something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the blue, you can see a lot of
platanus are labeled around buildings
[SPEAKER_01]: where we don't have the street tree
labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're painting everything in that we
need new labels for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can do this in a lot of bigger
neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, this is a relatively large
apartment blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that a lot of the trees
that weren't included in that street tree
[SPEAKER_01]: database, we can actually provide labels
for based on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do an initial test case on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about spatial variation in
phenology?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need some more information based on
temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a temperature data set that
takes coarser resolution data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Downscales it based on different
structural parameters on the surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: like green vegetation, impervious surface,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't make this product, but what's
really cool about it is that it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: high spatial resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get pretty good information on
what is the temperature accumulation for
[SPEAKER_01]: different trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's important about that is that if
you have different amount of temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: in different locations in the city,
you would expect, oh, if I'm in this
[SPEAKER_01]: location and it's this warm, well,
what will my leaf out timing be for this
[SPEAKER_01]: genus versus this genus?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have information about, okay,
it leafed out here and it's this warm,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we have much more better information
about which is which.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for two different genera, we might see
different response patterns in air
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we're kind of going next
steps for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I've been dealing with
the last week or so is looking at a
[SPEAKER_01]: webcam.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's called a phenocam,
so a phenology camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at the top of CUNY in northern
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just staring at this park all
the time, so this is St. Nicholas Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is in, this is beginning of April
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they look at is like they take a
polygon like this and then work through it
[SPEAKER_01]: through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the trees green up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just back of the envelope,
comparing this sort of polygon shape that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have versus the trees in this
polygon, 2022 were roughly the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: May 3rd, April 29th, which isn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2023, we're a couple weeks off,
but in digging into the data, there may be
[SPEAKER_01]: some issues with the phenocam and there
may be some issues with the plant scope
[SPEAKER_01]: imagery, so take that one with a grain of
salt for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm working on now is examining
individual trees, so taking little boxes
[SPEAKER_01]: of trees and tracking those through time
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some implications for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenology shows promise as a way of
identifying urban tree taxa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this platinus classification as
a proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's separability that currently
exists for other genera, but we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to build on this and include temperature,
phenology, relationships, and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: other things in order to do a better
classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal will be, well,
we're not going to get every single
[SPEAKER_01]: species across the entire city.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just too many of them,
but we can get a lot of the most populous
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't get populous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not in here, but we'll get a lot of
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So methods have potential to be scaled
spatially and temporally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could do this across multiple years
if we needed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the eventual goal will be to create a
scalable pipeline that can be applied to
[SPEAKER_01]: other cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you live in Cleveland or Chicago or
I don't know, Ithaca, if you had the data,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could do something like this,
which would be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice I didn't talk about health
at all for the last, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the big picture for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to link tree identity to
public health decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my corner, Dan's corner of the
project, is in this tree taxa
[SPEAKER_01]: classification, mapping trees in New York
using the remote sensing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're actually planning to do is
hand off this information to colleagues in
[SPEAKER_01]: civil engineering and Professor Chi Li's
group to do genus level classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that genus level classification and
turn it into an urban heat model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a model that can run at
pretty high spatial resolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly 100 meters or however much they
want to define it, and include that
[SPEAKER_01]: information on tree structure and cooling
to be able to have better information on
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the condition in different areas
and different neighborhoods at a scale
[SPEAKER_01]: that's relevant to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have that sort of temperature
and heat information, that can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: related to epidemiology and social
justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So assessing marginal effects of species
on like emergency department visits,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you have certain amount of certain
types of trees in a neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing those neighborhoods,
how many department visits do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: during heat waves or other times of year,
and also those different types of health
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of these trees into urban green
decisions and public health decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that includes colleagues at Weill
Cornell, including Arnav Ghosh and Wenna
[SPEAKER_01]: Shi, colleagues in natural resources,
and also in other parts around New England
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so additional acknowledgments,
colleagues at the Nature Conservancy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Natural Areas Conservancy,
two separate organizations with similar
[SPEAKER_01]: sounding names, and some other information
from colleagues at American University and
[SPEAKER_01]: CUC Santa Barbara to help with the plan
and scope data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to leave this up for the end,
and feel free to ask any questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, many cities are considering what's
going to happen with climate change and
[SPEAKER_03]: how that's going to have to change the
kinds of trees they plant in a given
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you contemplating those issues in your
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about, with climate
change, is that information in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the tree species palette should be
included in our work and how we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not addressing that specifically,
but that is definitely a question longer
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be something where you look
at different parts of the city and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this part of the city is warmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use the survivability in this
part of the city to compare and project in
[SPEAKER_01]: other parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff being done in terms of
moving different genotypes and planting
[SPEAKER_01]: those that are from further south.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not dealing with that end
specifically, but that's definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the animation, the time
series animation with the DVI going up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting that thing to kind of
plateau and stay kind of high,
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly level, but it peaks and then starts
going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this typical of all trees doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this something that could be used
for maybe differentiating trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty typical for trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It peaks and then it's... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a peak around June-ish and
then it slowly kind of declines through
[SPEAKER_01]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a dense canopy through the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not as bright, vibrant as you
would have first thing in the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that plateau isn't necessarily
totally flat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nice to hear more about what you've
been working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of related to this last question,
I'm curious if there are other land
[SPEAKER_05]: surface phenology metrics besides just
start of season and end of season that
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of describe that curve in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And have you guys looked at how some of
those other metrics might vary across the
[SPEAKER_05]: species in terms of helping to parse those
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about other land
surface phenology metrics besides just
[SPEAKER_01]: start of season and end of season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked into it, but we haven't
actually gotten too far with that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's other stuff we can fit in that
curve besides what I'm showing at start of
[SPEAKER_01]: season and end of season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the 50% point on these S
shape, like these sigmoid curves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do different times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these other phenology models
will do stuff where they have like,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the max, here's this mid slope
decline, lots of other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for now, we're just going to stick
with these and then build out from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we actually want to try to do is
actually lean on the color component of it
[SPEAKER_01]: more and see if we can pick out
individuals that have really distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: color situations, different parts of the
year, for example, like ginkgo trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that ginkgo tree out there turned
like this electric yellow in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can capture that, that would be
really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I want to think about that more
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your system allow you to capture like
invasive trees?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm thinking New York City,
Tree of Heaven, Bradford Pears,
[SPEAKER_06]: which a lot of folks certainly wouldn't
want to see, or at least an increasing
[SPEAKER_06]: number.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering, have you come
across that as being an issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, so the question is about,
can we capture invasive trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is, if they're in the data
set already and there's enough of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can probably label them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have 100% like what the
classification level is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tree of Heaven, Ilanthus, there's
enough of them that we should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't currently exist,
so there's very few, they won't show up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the classifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice talk, Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question, coming back to your
very original motivation, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: cooling, different cooling factor from
different species.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering how your classifier map
can be combined with ET, like Yun is
[SPEAKER_04]: doing, to optimize like spatial
distribution of different tree species to
[SPEAKER_04]: basically, to best mitigate the heat in
the tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the first question is about
looking at different species types and
[SPEAKER_01]: evapotranspiration and how their cooling
will be included in the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about that, and we're not
100% sure how that's going to slot in
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first factor is leaf area index,
of course, which is just the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves you have over the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we would like to do is look at
like the TRY database and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: different species cooling capacities and
be able to work with Professor Lee to
[SPEAKER_01]: include what we can in the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's still a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second question is about air quality
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Dan's very interested in air
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we've been talking about some of
the stuff related to pollen, but other
[SPEAKER_01]: things related to like VOCs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that more, because
there's a lot of cool implications that
[SPEAKER_01]: can come out of classification once we
have it.
Thanks.
All right.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
