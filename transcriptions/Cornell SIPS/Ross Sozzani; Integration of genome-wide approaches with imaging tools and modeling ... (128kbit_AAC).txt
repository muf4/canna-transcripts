[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's a great pleasure today to
introduce Rossozzani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ros did her graduate work in Italy and
then was a postdoc with Philip Benfi and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when I met her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did this absolutely beautiful work
looking at how developmental regulation
[SPEAKER_02]: interacts with a cell cycle, looking at
the downstream gene network of short root
[SPEAKER_02]: and scarecrow in the cortex endodermal
initial division and found cyclin D6-1 is
[SPEAKER_02]: downstream of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was absolutely beautiful and I have
been very interested in how cell cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: interacts with cell identity and so I
loved her work when I saw that and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been friends ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met at several conferences and Ros is
one of these people who's always doing
[SPEAKER_02]: something innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always love hearing what her latest
thing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a beautiful publication in eLife
with a new microscopy method to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: protein movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was telling me last night about a
contraption she and a collaborator were
[SPEAKER_02]: building to image multiple roots
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: With live imaging and she does beautiful
gene regulatory network and now
[SPEAKER_02]: computational analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also teaching a joint class with an
engineer on computational biology at North
[SPEAKER_02]: Carolina State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome Ros and I'm looking forward to
your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Adrian for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true our friendship goes back when we
were both interviewing for job at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time and I always cheer for her to get the
best offer because she's an outstanding
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist, an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're so lucky to have her here that
I'm trying to get her to come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so today what I really like to do is
to just spend a couple of minutes and to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up why I'm working with plant in a
broader aspect and then I'm going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you three different stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tendency I try to always tell unpublished
story but things don't develop that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll spend most of the time talking
about unpublished story and the other two
[SPEAKER_00]: they were just recently published in eLife
and developmental biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will be short and I apologize that
they're already published but maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't yet seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say just let's keep this talk
very informal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just ask me any question that you want
during the talk and now towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to change the speed of my talk
and need so that everybody is on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again it will be about three stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay awake for the story you're most
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have an outline telling you when you
can go to sleep and when you can wake up
[SPEAKER_00]: or etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that I'll take on take again
Adrian to having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my interesting is really to
identify other people need identifying for
[SPEAKER_00]: me but pursuing some of the grand
challenges of our century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are these grand challenges
growing our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants our economy to get better
improving our health of course protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: our environment and enriching our youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at the university so we are all
agree with these four great challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I am here why plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there is a fifth and I would say very
important aspect that is feeding our
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the graduate student in here at
the talk they is extremely important how
[SPEAKER_00]: you really position yourself in this group
of amazing scientists and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate to your parents the public
what is the need why we need more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we are a very growing population.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2050 we're going to grow up to nine
billion people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Food and Agricultural Organization
tell us that we need to increase food
[SPEAKER_00]: production by 70 percent if we want to
feed the world population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the very first things that one
would say is well just plant more crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that another let's say
statistical scariness is that the arable
[SPEAKER_00]: land is declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always joke that I work on
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a model plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2050 we'll only see on the sidewalk
Arabidopsis plant and there will be not
[SPEAKER_00]: much arable land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so still when I'm talking to my mother
I say well we need to provide more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arable land is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would say well when I was a kid let's
say when I was a teenager she would say we
[SPEAKER_00]: will put a lot of fertilizer so that even
if you have a smaller land you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all know from the first green
revolution that that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that now fertilizer are
starting to harm the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we remain with these great green
challenge that we need more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have less land and we want to provide
enough food without harming the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like this date and I just told my
head of the department that I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: retire 2050 when I say well I did anything
I could up to that point to at least feed
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a beginning what you're going to
see from me is all research done on a
[SPEAKER_00]: model system hoping that all the research
and efforts we're putting in our model
[SPEAKER_00]: system will actually be then eventually
translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not meant to be there but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so focus on the need feed more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic approach is we are trying to
re-engineer stem cell regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our basic idea very grounded to the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always joke they say I'm very short so
I'm very close to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my idea is very grounded base.
[SPEAKER_00]: If stem cell give rise to all the tissue
and organ of a plant what if we learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about stem cell regulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we actually modify the architecture of
a plant from the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is to use everything that
we can gain from these model plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis and then eventually translate
that to the non-Arabidopsis plant and even
[SPEAKER_00]: to our to ourself as exemplified by the
Vitruvian men.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the talk for which you can stay
awake or you can fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all unpublished data where I'm
going to show you how we're going to we
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain stem cell type transcriptional
profile of genes and then we kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: had to gain more information about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to generate a gene regulatory
network of the stem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be a little bit on the
computational side and then if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested then in new in vivo imaging
where you can obtain information about
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of protein or for example in vivo
protein-protein interaction where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get down to the stoichiometry of protein
interaction then I'll wake you up and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you about this story and then the third
one will be to let's say make the life of
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student and postdoc better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we are trying to develop imaging
technique or at least the imaging device
[SPEAKER_00]: that will increase the eye throughput and
so I had the just wonderful talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: Miguel saying how eye throughput is
actually very important even if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to sacrifice on something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the whole three section of the talk
the main role is going to be played by not
[SPEAKER_00]: only Arabidopsis but the root of
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mainly is why were we using Arabidopsis
root is an extremely tractable system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to do a lot of cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toolbox in terms of molecular biology
they are fantastic for all our colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: and friends that have worked towards that
but especially for this talk I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: you to remember two or just one aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem cell that we are going to talk
today are found at the tip of the root and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the cells derive from division,
asymmetric cell division of the stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: and so when a daughter cells is derived
and then another cell is divided then the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells are pushed upwards such way that you
can follow time along the longitudinal
[SPEAKER_00]: axis so we have a developmental time along
the root and then what we have is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: root is speaking with you as a concentric
cylinder and so you can reduce a 3D space
[SPEAKER_00]: into a 2D space because all these cells
are radially symmetric with the exception
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vasculature but we're not going to
go into detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can follow time and space and so
when you can deal with spatial temporal
[SPEAKER_00]: information the best tool you could use
for me at least was to use the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going into right away the talk so we
were fortunate enough that we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect all the different stem cell marker
of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some we developed, some were from talking
with colleagues and say oh we are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get all the stem cell marker and these
phenomenal colleagues are just sharing all
[SPEAKER_00]: their marker even before publication for a
great collaboration so we have all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different fluorescent marker of the
difference themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can do, what we can obtain stem
cell specific transcriptomic profile by
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that we can identify stem cell
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we do that, I'm not going to go too
much into the details but we use
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent activity cell sorting so we
can obtain, we can protoplast this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we obtain two population of cells,
non-fluorescent protein and fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: protein so that we have an enriched
population of the different stem cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can do RNAseq data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody so far following?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these data what we did,
well the first point I had to sit down and
[SPEAKER_00]: say well as cool as it that we want to
work on stem cell we never really show and
[SPEAKER_00]: there were no data whatsoever that the
stem cell were actually transcriptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: different from non-stem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to do that at first,
we had to look at our stem cell and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we said well are those different stem cell
transcriptionally set apart from non-stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and so we had data transcriptomic
data from let's say stage one that
[SPEAKER_00]: contains all the stem cell and
transamplifying zone where cells divide
[SPEAKER_00]: very often and then we have a stage two
that contain elongating cells and stage
[SPEAKER_00]: three that will contain differentiated
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from these principle component
analysis so very first point that I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make here is a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first time I saw this PCA,
this is the work of my postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: Angel's, she's an allergic and computer
engineer, she never worked with biologists
[SPEAKER_00]: before and when I saw that I said wait a
second, we're working on our paradoxes not
[SPEAKER_00]: on Drosophila embryo, what is going on
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said no no no everything is on the
right track, what you're seeing here is
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and how they are different from
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, I always take the second and
actually ask a graduate student if he sees
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a volunteer here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well graduate students are gonna have
lunch with me right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna have a free lunch,
let's make it less of a free, who is the
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student that wants to take the
lead and see if you see beside the
[SPEAKER_00]: Drosophila embryo if you see any
difference if you see that the stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: have a different transcriptional profile
than the non-stem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the graduate students?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then now I need to pick you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hiding, wait a second,
you're gonna have lunch with me so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna see you in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay you kept your hand enough that it
seems, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like the more mature cells are
farther along the right side of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: principal component largely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right so big point you're having a extra
slice of pizza if there's pizza for lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: because you deserved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was actually very nice because we
saw that yes stem cell were
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptionally different than non-stem
cell what we realize is that stage one
[SPEAKER_00]: that contains some of the stem cell
couldn't use for any farther analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have that stage one is as we
expected close to the stem cell and the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-stem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a very first positive result
that when you're starting your lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying well am I going the right
direction I said it seems so yes if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking at the stem cell type
specific expression we're going the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction because indeed they are
different from non-stem cell and so with
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind we identify that are specific
for the stem cell only 1,600 genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: which 200 were transcription factors and
so we know exactly where all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes are expressing which stem
cell and etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that in mind then you could do
1,600 genes or 200 transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: you say 200 we can do reverse engineer we
can order 200 knockout line and good luck
[SPEAKER_00]: to the graduate student and postdoc
working with all these mutants right or we
[SPEAKER_00]: could strategize differently and then we
sat down with my postdoc and say well
[SPEAKER_00]: given a lot of information that I'm going
to give you in a second can we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: find the way that we rank what of these
1,600 gene or these 200 transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factor will most likely have a major role
in stem cell function and so we sat down
[SPEAKER_00]: and we developed a computational pipeline
and I'm going to go into the details in a
[SPEAKER_00]: second but I wanted to tell you that is a
joke that I'm going to steal from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else I just heard when you have a
computational pipeline you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: show every single needy greedy details
it's like when you have picture of your
[SPEAKER_00]: child and you want to show all the picture
of your child to your friends they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care much so I'm going to give you just a
brief overview of this computational
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline but I'm happy to give you any
extra details that you need so the
[SPEAKER_00]: computational pipeline is based on two
major aspects so is taking advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: spatial temporal data and so what are
these spatial temporal data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spatial is all the different stem cell
marker transcriptomic profile so cell type
[SPEAKER_00]: specific transcriptomic profile and
temporal data as I was telling you the
[SPEAKER_00]: root has embedded in the longitudinal axis
time so the temporal data is all the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression at every single developmental
time of the root so we had a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: data set already available from Siobhan
Brady showing dividing up the root in 12
[SPEAKER_00]: section that so we consider that a 12 time
point data set and so the computational
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline has a very first clustering step
that is a normal clustering step that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody may want to use and mainly is
based on gene co-expression the main
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption of it is that if a gene is
expressed in one specific stem cell then
[SPEAKER_00]: that gene should function in that stem
cell so they're practically dividing up
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene if their expression is specific
to one stem cell or two two three stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and etc and then the novel aspect of
these computational pipeline is a dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: vision network inference and is a very
simple concept the idea here is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you find if you have a regulator you
expect that these regulator is controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: a gene either in the time point or the
same time point or one time point after
[SPEAKER_00]: and so is based on a first assumption of
Markov where we saying well given the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression and time lapse zero and time
lapse one what is the probability that
[SPEAKER_00]: these gene is regulating these allergy and
so you do these inference throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 data point and then the other aspect
that you can have is that you can see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a directionality of regulation so
if he's up regulating one gene at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: lapse one or if he's down regulating okay
oh and those are steps of the network is
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea here was to look at intra cluster
connection so first of all considering
[SPEAKER_00]: just network that are for a specific stem
cell so that you will look at the network
[SPEAKER_00]: of genes that function just for that stem
cell and also inter cluster so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: function in one stem cell but they also
have a connection with another cell
[SPEAKER_00]: because all of these are multi cell
organism and we know this there is cell to
[SPEAKER_00]: cell communication and then you're gonna
see in a little bit the resulting network
[SPEAKER_00]: but before showing you the resulting
network you say oh this is all look good
[SPEAKER_00]: but how can you actually prove that this
is solid and reliable and etc so
[SPEAKER_00]: computationally we need to do a couple of
step before we can say we are confident
[SPEAKER_00]: about our infer network because it's still
based on probability right and so the next
[SPEAKER_00]: two step are how we validated in silly go
practically our new algorithm so our new
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm is the name is genies and you
can have a better name we still have the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to change it I really don't like it
but genie stands for gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: network inference from spatial temporal
data horrible name but there's no way that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find a better acronym but what we
were extremely pleased is when you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: new algorithm generally you challenge your
algorithm through a dream for now there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a dream five competition where you have
other existing algorithm existing data
[SPEAKER_00]: sets that they are challenged one against
each other and then you can choose
[SPEAKER_00]: specific matrix for example precision area
under the rock and then practically these
[SPEAKER_00]: are indirect measurement of the ratio of
true positive and false positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: genies always perform best and especially
the important aspect here is if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: node of 100 node or a little bit that 100
node they tell us that we will have very
[SPEAKER_00]: low false positive so that our graduate
student and postdoc will be happy to go
[SPEAKER_00]: after genes because they're not gonna
quote unquote waste their time and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other aspect though that is currently a
limitation and we are working on it it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us confidence if we model 100 200
gene network so I told you that we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand six hundred genes that were
specific for the stem cell and then is not
[SPEAKER_00]: by chance but I put that there are 200
transcription factors so from now on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna see is the transcription
factor network of the stem cell because we
[SPEAKER_00]: were highly confident for just modeling
these 200 genes and we couldn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: model the a thousand six hundred genes but
we're working on developing different
[SPEAKER_00]: steps so that we can deal with many more
genes another way that you can know an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional way that you should validate
new algorithm is with using in vivo data
[SPEAKER_00]: so for example here is an example for
example is an example of a known network
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cell type in the root where we have
these master regulator downstream genes
[SPEAKER_00]: and etc and so we compare our new
algorithm with existing algorithm mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that is often uses arachne and
what you can see here well it performs
[SPEAKER_00]: very well it finds four true positive one
false negative mainly because there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation back of this transcription
factor but what I would like you to see
[SPEAKER_00]: here is the difference between two pan
these two panels that our new algorithm
[SPEAKER_00]: what it can do it can find the
directionality as I was telling you so
[SPEAKER_00]: these arrow will actually tell you who is
regulating whom and the sign of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation if he's an activator or
oppression and the other thing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can clearly see is the different size of
these nodes so we use a matrix that tells
[SPEAKER_00]: you the importance of the different
transcription factor based on some aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: in this aspect could be outgoing edges so
outgoing regulation it could be on in how
[SPEAKER_00]: many people were loop these gene is
involved how many feedback loop how many
[SPEAKER_00]: by fan loop so you look at the network
topology and based on the network topology
[SPEAKER_00]: you can infer a ranking and so you can
infer a size of the node so that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were a graduate student you will not put
that much effort seem to see too but you
[SPEAKER_00]: will put much effort seem to these APL
gene that indeed we know is a master
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator of flowing development so the
next thing you're gonna see yeah go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: you want an extra pizza slice I got it
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent point the edges are also
different sizes because we have actually
[SPEAKER_00]: weight associated with each so the point
here when we cluster we do came in
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters and we run it for 10,000 times
and so based on the came in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene will go in one cell in one cluster
some of them will go in another cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: and so sometimes the edges don't exist so
what we do what we set a threshold it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.6 and then we drop all the edges that
are less important so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that many interaction yes so is based on
the weight and the number of how many
[SPEAKER_00]: times these happens throughout the
inference algorithm yep very good point
[SPEAKER_00]: extras which lab which lab are you in okay
so what you have here is the resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: network and is as I'm proud of my daughter
I'm proud of these network because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: the real vapors feature of all these
transcription factor for which there were
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years of work and what we can see is
that from these middle part of the network
[SPEAKER_00]: we do really recover all and with the
dollar sign is the happy myself we all
[SPEAKER_00]: recover genes for which in literature
there are data confirming their role in
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cell specification in stem cell
maintenance root development so what these
[SPEAKER_00]: network is showing just to make it brief
in the middle is showing all the stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in all the stem cell genes that
are important for the maintenance and then
[SPEAKER_00]: on the side at the beginning I was calling
these the spaghetti meatball disaster but
[SPEAKER_00]: then here's an Italian and I can I guess
but then biologically it makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sense all of these large notes are
important for the maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: specification of the stem cell and all of
these sub clusters then we look into them
[SPEAKER_00]: and we identify genes that have an
importance is for example specific stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell type function so what I'm going to
tell you next is that well we took to stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell identity network and valley dated
them in two different ways so the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first way was to look at chromatin
immunoprecipitation so protein DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction of these specific silent stem
cell so chromatin immunoprecipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: using these known transcription factor
that is actually the transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: was working while I was a postdoc and then
we also look at my home that's fine my own
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression data while I was a postdoc
of the induction of these gene and so what
[SPEAKER_00]: we could find in these network that one
two three four five six five out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: six downstream gene were confirmed by
chromatin immunoprecipitation and by gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression profile we still have one that
is not confirmed but we're working on
[SPEAKER_00]: using you molecular technique to see if
this is a real target or is a false
[SPEAKER_00]: positive the other that I would like to
spend and these panel was supposed to come
[SPEAKER_00]: up later but that's okay is the quiescent
center network so we were fortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that just recently Martin Yipnowski
have shown an important role of these gene
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor entity in the
quiescent center we had great work done on
[SPEAKER_00]: Bravo showing function of these gene in
the quiescent center but then we all and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we have known plethora one,
plethora two, plethora six that we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know that are important for QC function
and then we focus our attention on these
[SPEAKER_00]: gene periodontia and what we identify is
that you can believe me but I have another
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with the marketing side where we
see QC phenotype so the QC is this little
[SPEAKER_00]: hand part this smiley part of the root
this is a little bit crooked it will need
[SPEAKER_00]: some braces in terms of smiles it has some
crooked quiescent center and what we know
[SPEAKER_00]: from many years of work is that if you
don't have a functional quiescent center
[SPEAKER_00]: the distal stem cells that are the
collumal stem cells they depreciate and so
[SPEAKER_00]: what we obtained with a collaborator a
fantastic collaborator from Spain the
[SPEAKER_00]: inducible line of these gene periodontia
what you have is that you have extra
[SPEAKER_00]: collumal stem cell and the reason while
I'm saying that this is a PSPI staining
[SPEAKER_00]: where in red you can see the starch
granule so you have that in a mutant the
[SPEAKER_00]: starch granule are really close to the
quiescent center suggesting that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no collumal stem cell and here you see
extra layer of collumal stem cell and so
[SPEAKER_00]: we did and I'm going to not show you in
the details we did a mathematical model to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the function of pen but as
biologists and that is the reason why the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper is not yet out is under revision
because the reviewer thank you to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewer they asked for more biological
data what we did and that is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant but this time with the quiescent
center marker so you can see that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: crooked quiescent center we did RNAseq so
we look at the gene expression profile of
[SPEAKER_00]: these of the gene in this mutant compared
to wild type and that day I think I was
[SPEAKER_00]: close to cry so happy I was because if I
take a second and I go back to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these stem cell niche network what we find
is that 70% of all the stem cell niche and
[SPEAKER_00]: the one in the quiescent center they're
all downregulated in these pen mutants so
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our shore root gene is
downregulated all the plethora gene are
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulated all the other stem cell
genes are all downregulated suggesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that our network identify a master
regulator for quiescent center function
[SPEAKER_00]: and stem cell maintenance extremely happy
so that was the very first part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: talk perfect because the rest of the talk
will be just telling you and pointing you
[SPEAKER_00]: to these paper because unfortunately don't
have enough data to make another story so
[SPEAKER_00]: these very first part is that we develop a
gene regulatory network inference that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes advantage of any kind of spatial
temporal data so for example we have used
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays in collaboration with then cheat
would and use to make a leaf development
[SPEAKER_00]: to infer network involving leaf thickness
we use it for strawberry development from
[SPEAKER_00]: the green strawberry to the red strawberry
so anytime you have a time course and cell
[SPEAKER_00]: type or tissue type or integration line
data set you can combine these two data
[SPEAKER_00]: set and get useful information so now
these are going to be just ten minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: long and then I'll be happy to have many
more question just going back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial image that they show you the root
is a concentric cylinder what I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beginning is that all the different
stem cells give rise to all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue through asymmetric cell division
and work done while I was a postdoc in
[SPEAKER_00]: philip benphi's lab and that I started
while I was in philip so is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration we had was to study key
aspect regarding these two important
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor they regulate the
asymmetric cell division of one kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cell type that is the cortex endodermis
initial so in a short mutant you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to remember the name but they will
come up very often sure would just
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that these mutant was identified
had a very short short short route and
[SPEAKER_00]: then scarecrow was identified because he
also let these asymmetric cell division
[SPEAKER_00]: and he only had one ground tissue and so
it was named after the wizard of us they
[SPEAKER_00]: were two other mutant teeny man and lion
they also were missing some other cell
[SPEAKER_00]: type and these was I think call scarecrow
because at that time it was considered
[SPEAKER_00]: that the ground issue was the brain of the
route perhaps I was not there so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: put my hand on fire but remember a shorter
teeny tiny route and scarecrow the one
[SPEAKER_00]: without the brain but what we know that is
not just specific to these transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factor we have now plethora of data
showing that about 20 30 percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor actually moving
transcription factor so they move from
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are produced to adjacent cell
layer so these transcription factor is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the vasculature of the route and
it moves to the adjacent cell layer where
[SPEAKER_00]: it activate the downstream target
scarecrow and then we know that short and
[SPEAKER_00]: scarecrow interact together to regulate
these asymmetric cell division of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground tissue and so we had a mathematical
model and we really never asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: question is the quantification of this
movement important if we want to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: more quantitative model and is the
stoichiometry of the protein complex
[SPEAKER_00]: important you don't know until you test
that right and so we started to
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate with the scientists physicists
that you see your vine that he started
[SPEAKER_00]: just back then to use fluorescent
correlations spectroscopy scanning
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent correlations spectroscopy to
obtain information about movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and protein-protein interaction so
I don't want to go too much into the
[SPEAKER_00]: physics details but it's practically when
you have your sample and you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: under for example a laser scanning
microscope a confocal I know you tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: just have the most beautiful picture right
but the background things that is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: is that every time you have fluorescent
protein and it goes in and out your
[SPEAKER_00]: observation volume that is your confocal
objective and when it goes in and out your
[SPEAKER_00]: observation volume what it does it emits
intensity fluctuation and if you follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the intensity fluctuation over time and
over space and then you feed using an
[SPEAKER_00]: autocorrelation function you can do indeed
obtain information about the movement the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration and if you do dual
fluorescent cross correlation and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: two fluorescent protein one that gives an
intensive fluctuation in for example the
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP channel and one that gives you
intensive fluctuation in the red channel
[SPEAKER_00]: you can cross correlate and fit to this
cross correlation function and get
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the stoichiometry of the
protein complex so that for example you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care much if these protein are close
to each other so if you will need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: protein-protein interaction using FRET but
they can just be in the same protein
[SPEAKER_00]: complex even if they are far apart they
will still cross correlate and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: still give you information about the
protein-protein interaction so the
[SPEAKER_00]: scanning region very good question it
depends so it depends on let's see if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have an image here no okay the scanning
region could go through two or three cells
[SPEAKER_00]: so is
[SPEAKER_00]: few microns I'm trying to remember top of
my head just few microns because the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: in the root are very small but you can
have as long as you want with no problem
[SPEAKER_00]: let me walk you through a little bit and
see if I can get from you another question
[SPEAKER_00]: because so the point here is that with
raster image correlations for microscopy
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you do a scanning of a 2d frame
and so it could be as big as you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: important is that for example that the
pixel size is smaller than your point
[SPEAKER_00]: spread function so that is more
informative than you can image whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want you will just have longer
scanning but the important is that so your
[SPEAKER_00]: point spread function that is the
observation volume of your objective is
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency around 300 nanometer and you need
to have at least five to six pixels in
[SPEAKER_00]: each point spread function to have enough
correlation hope that that answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: question and so what I'm going to present
you and that we use these imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: technique in the plan for the first time
is raster image correlations spectroscopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to go into details in a
second that you can really calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and so what I want to take here
is a second and tell you that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use diffusion coefficient as a term but
that doesn't mean that your protein are
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusing they can be actively transported
it's just that the physics terms is
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion coefficient but they can be
really actively transported as in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case and then what I'm going to show you
is a line scan where we can tell really
[SPEAKER_00]: the intra and intercellular movement of a
protein and the number and brightness so
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the three techniques that I'm
going to spend next five minutes to it
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can see the oligomeric state of a
protein at the cellular level so the
[SPEAKER_00]: raster scan is really a raster of your 2d
image so you you trace you send your laser
[SPEAKER_00]: along the line and then along the frame so
that you can image the cell type of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest or the two different cell type of
interest in this case it will be cells
[SPEAKER_00]: that contain the vasculature where we know
the protein is produced and then cells
[SPEAKER_00]: where the protein moves to and so without
going too much into the details what we
[SPEAKER_00]: could already see is that there is a
differential movement of this
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor in this cell type
versus these other cell type where it
[SPEAKER_00]: moves and so we knew from previous
molecular data that this could be because
[SPEAKER_00]: in these endodermal cell is where short
route interacts with scarecrow and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder whether the slow movement of short
route was because of scarecrow and so in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case we really can quantify this
movement and is significant and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it caused an asymmetric cell division
we can see that in absence of scarecrow or
[SPEAKER_00]: in a scarecrow RNAi line now in the
endodermis what we have is that short
[SPEAKER_00]: route now moves like it will move in the
vasculature suggesting that yes indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: scarecrow is important for the movement of
short route the other thing that we look
[SPEAKER_00]: is well what is the movement and how
scarecrow restrict short movement and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they are PCF data where PCF is practically
correlating all the intensity fluctuation
[SPEAKER_00]: along a line that spans different cells so
that you can ask a question does this
[SPEAKER_00]: protein move from the cell type to the
cell type to the cell type and vice versa
[SPEAKER_00]: and if there is a differential movement
where these differential movement is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from and so in order for you to
actually read through the heat map that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you in a second I'm
going to just show you an exemplify
[SPEAKER_00]: version so the heat map or carpet that we
obtain are going to be looking like that
[SPEAKER_00]: so in the x direction is space in the y
direction is time if a protein is moving
[SPEAKER_00]: cell to cell to cell to cell in a
diffusive route in this way without any
[SPEAKER_00]: active movement what you're going to see
in blue is the representation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement between cells with diffusion if
you instead don't see diffusion so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: only see blue means correlation so
movement black means no movement if you
[SPEAKER_00]: see that you only see movement here but
not here then this will be your exemplify
[SPEAKER_00]: heat map if you instead see a delay in the
movement so you will see a arch formation
[SPEAKER_00]: that tells you that is taking some time
for this protein to move from cell to cell
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually will move and so we ask the
question well what is the movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: short route from where it's produced to
where it ends up and so what we can see is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it moves we know that short route
moves through plasmodesmata the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmatic connection it moves through
one cell and another through a delay
[SPEAKER_00]: movement but then when we look at the
direction like the directionality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement so going back to the vasculature
that kind of would correspond to the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that at that point short is moving slower
than in the vasculature we can clearly see
[SPEAKER_00]: that short route does not move back into
the vasculature and so I've shown you
[SPEAKER_00]: before that if we take away scarecrow he
moves faster now short route and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the intra and intercellular
movement of short route in a scarecrow
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant background and fear enough what we
find is that in a scarecrow RNAi line we
[SPEAKER_00]: can track that short route is going back
to the vasculature so these were to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you that indeed we can quantify the
movement and really give a route of the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of this transcription factor and
then we can also look in how they interact
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is the background you just need to
leave me here we need to calibrate every
[SPEAKER_00]: time with the control line that is a
monomeric form where for example monomeric
[SPEAKER_00]: form are exemplified by these blue pixels
when we look at short route oligomeric
[SPEAKER_00]: state what we are seeing if you imagine
here is a route this is the vasculature
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's produced and this is the nuclei
of the endodermis where it's moving what
[SPEAKER_00]: we see is that if there is a percentage of
monomeric form of short route just in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vasculature while there is a higher
oligomeric state in terms of dimers and
[SPEAKER_00]: tetramyl in the endodermis where interacts
with scarecrow so again we ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: question if he interacts with scarecrow is
the oligomeric state of short route
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by the absence of scarecrow and
so what we are looking here is more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less the same orientation you can clearly
see that in the nuclei of the endodermis
[SPEAKER_00]: where now scarecrow is no longer there
short is just as a monomer and so that
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us that scarecrow is practically a
bridge bringing together two short route
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and so what we did we took an
additional step and look at the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation so we label short route with
the GFP we label scarecrow with the
[SPEAKER_00]: m-cherry you can clearly see where they
are expressed short route scarecrow
[SPEAKER_00]: usually you will just look at the
localization and say fair enough but what
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually went is where they interact
how they interact so this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation map where you can
qualitatively see with the blue dots where
[SPEAKER_00]: they are interacting in a stoichiometry of
one to one and the green dots where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are interacting a stoichiometry of two to
one and here is the stoichiometric
[SPEAKER_00]: histogram where we can see that there are
mostly one short and worse scarecrow with
[SPEAKER_00]: red exemplifying the highest probability
to find this transcription factor in a
[SPEAKER_00]: stoichiometry of one to one but also that
you have a high probability to find two
[SPEAKER_00]: short route with one scarecrow and here is
the quantification so everything that I
[SPEAKER_00]: show you qualitatively we can also obtain
the quantification so 80% of these is of
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein-protein interaction is one to
one and two to one is limited to 15% so
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm telling you all this story well
I'm telling you all this story because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's extremely cool to be and go into
details of identifying the movement and
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify the movement and the
stoichiometry but the idea we had was to
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain these information and develop a
mathematical model that will give us
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the dynamics of these
two transcription factors so this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical model that we use is a series
of ordinary differential equation where we
[SPEAKER_00]: are modeling for example short route in
the vasculature short route in the
[SPEAKER_00]: endodermis and then from our data we know
that there are dimers of short route in
[SPEAKER_00]: the endodermis so that is the equation for
that aspect and then we have the model
[SPEAKER_00]: scarecrow and this is a yield term because
we know the short route regulates
[SPEAKER_00]: scarecrow and then we have the complex one
to one of short route scarecrow and the
[SPEAKER_00]: complex of two to one short route
scarecrow so all the information that I
[SPEAKER_00]: told you we practically retranslate in a
mathematical model it's like you will
[SPEAKER_00]: translate from the English to the Italian
all of these is what I just told you from
[SPEAKER_00]: the biology into the mathematical model we
ran up sensitivity analysis and find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that diffusion coefficient were extremely
important but let me tell you what the
[SPEAKER_00]: model tell us and how we validate it so
what these first outcome simulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: model tells you is that we don't know
anything about short so short is produced
[SPEAKER_00]: and it stays constant we can do much about
that until we identify upstream regulator
[SPEAKER_00]: of short in the red line is the expression
of scarecrow over time and what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see is that about two point five three
hour is when you reach the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of scarecrow and what you can
learn here is that as soon as scarecrow is
[SPEAKER_00]: produced is sequestered by short route and
you have the formation of a short route
[SPEAKER_00]: scarecrow one to one protein complex only
with time taking place at about nine hour
[SPEAKER_00]: we start to see that the two to one
scarecrow short route complex takes place
[SPEAKER_00]: and so what we did we practically
validated these mathematical models by
[SPEAKER_00]: using a short route inducible system where
we put a scarecrow transcription line and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can see is that after we use short
route so like we'll do the mathematical
[SPEAKER_00]: model the simulation here as soon as we
use short route at about three hour we
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see scarecrow expression and that
will feed that very well the other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are now working on is that you can
see that at all the solution reaches a
[SPEAKER_00]: steady state so they reach a plateau what
that means well we know that about 16 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 24 hours when the stem cells start
to divide but we really didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: way to track and follow stem cell division
over time so these still remain the part
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're working on and understand the
second outcome of the model and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: second part of the talk and the next one
I'll just glance through is okay is really
[SPEAKER_00]: that scanning fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy allow you to quantify
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter that were not that easy to
quantify before and then all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative measurements they can really
be put into a mathematical model that is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to tell you what are the dynamic of
your system and so these that in this talk
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you it was a natural
progression what we started to use these
[SPEAKER_00]: before we got these data is to develop new
technology to do long time course and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the long time course that I'm talking
about is to using a live sheet microscopy
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm going to just tell you not the
advantages but the limitation that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: to overcome so with this system you can
grow one sample at a time and as I was
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you you need to get high
throughput to get your graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: and postdoc happy so we wanted to if you
want to do a five days time course then
[SPEAKER_00]: you have and you want 12 biological
replicas your graduate student is working
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week for the next 12 weeks on a
single project then you know how it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time experiment fails so it's
going to take six months so then you get
[SPEAKER_00]: one real good data set so what we did we
collaborated with an engineer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: department of industrial and system
engineer and with team horn and we develop
[SPEAKER_00]: a system that use the same exact aspect
and spec of the live sheet microscope that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using but at this time now with 3d
printed an imaging chamber that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: magic it was really magic multi-sample
Arabidopsis growth and imaging chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could image at least four sample
at the time rather than one so rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: wait 12 weeks now you get that you image
one plant you rotate these revolving
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber you image the second plan you
rotate so you have four biological
[SPEAKER_00]: replicates right there so you reduce a lot
the time and the cost these things cost a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and so currently we have a prototype
that holds more than four because we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to run just a couple of biological
replicates and have enough statistics so
[SPEAKER_00]: we tried out the system using a marker for
cell division and currently we use an
[SPEAKER_00]: existing pipeline in PG but we are working
with the latex and computer engineer
[SPEAKER_00]: Cranos Williams amazing collaborator in
the field to develop our own automatic
[SPEAKER_00]: image pipeline to calculate cell division
overcoming over time especially for the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cell we validated this is the
existing pipeline we're happy to share is
[SPEAKER_00]: practically coming up from Fiji so
extremely useful what we could be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure was all the different new cell
division using our system and using the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing system from Zeiss and that you
can see that along the time our system
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are very happy and they keep on
dividing you on that and so we image more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for more than 48 hour and the nice
part is that now we can do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment where we change the design of
these chamber where we can do drug
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment temperature treatment because we
have a temperature sensor and so on so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth so the end of the talk is kind of
like the take-home message different talk
[SPEAKER_00]: but all together our umbrella question is
how can we really understand stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation so that we can manipulate stem
cell regulation and so is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulation and work of biology
computational biology and develop a new
[SPEAKER_00]: technique and so that was exemplified by
modeling cell type specific expression and
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea here again my good friend the
Vitruvian man is eventually so there are
[SPEAKER_00]: known animal stem cell network player can
we actually obtain the end full plant stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell genes in the rabidopsis and so this
is an old picture but a couple of more
[SPEAKER_00]: people were added to the group but this is
the core group we started with work today
[SPEAKER_00]: that I shown you was from the postdoc
angels the Luis Balaguer analytic and
[SPEAKER_00]: computer engineer PhD my PhD student Adam
and Natalie and then great collaborator
[SPEAKER_00]: from NC State the engineer Timothy Horn
and Kranos Williams and great collaborator
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout and funding from NSF a career
grant and a bilateral grant with the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: and NSF BBCRC grant and with that I take
any question I'm so sorry that I ran at
[SPEAKER_00]: the clock but I'll take any question I
[SPEAKER_06]: know it was a lot I hope use left a little
bit your gene expression studies the first
[SPEAKER_06]: thing you do is take your roots for the
RNA-seq and you digest the cells away sit
there and they get isolated to protoplasts
right so you've lost the sympathy
[SPEAKER_06]: continuity and presumably these cells are
enormously stressed so do you have an idea
[SPEAKER_06]: of what that does to the overall topology
of your gene network?
[SPEAKER_00]: is a concern that we all keep in our back
mind to do the protoplasting what I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you is that all the different line
are treated the same way so if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: gene that are differentially regulated by
the actual protoplasting system they will
[SPEAKER_00]: be discarded because they will have the
same change in expression over samples the
[SPEAKER_00]: other aspect is that we need to get cell
type specific expression and that is so
[SPEAKER_00]: far what we can do best but yeah you're
right we is hour and a half protocol for
[SPEAKER_00]: which yes a lot of gene will change their
expression profile because of the stress
[SPEAKER_00]: but you should normalize and lose this
gene and so probably we will lose some
[SPEAKER_00]: genes but the point here is at least the
gene that you're going to go after like
[SPEAKER_00]: for example the Peryanthia gene clearly
show that has a role in the stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: function so we are doing laser capture but
for example we are doing laser capture
[SPEAKER_00]: where we cannot do so we have a project
with popular trees where we can clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: show and follow the morphology of the stem
cell for secondary growth and we do laser
[SPEAKER_00]: capture but for example for these those
are very teeny tiny roots and so it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that easy is it's not that easy yeah but
good point one could think to do intact or
[SPEAKER_00]: so on but so far we're happy what we get
but is always you need to keep that in
[SPEAKER_04]: your back yeah yeah you you are totally on
point you want to come in my lab and work
[SPEAKER_00]: in my lab please do because I'm always
telling my graduate student can we in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way from the gene regulatory network infer
which are the genes that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: moving or etc we will not be able to until
we also have protein information but there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a key point these gene move around and
so we should get to the point where we
[SPEAKER_00]: develop computational model that predicts
which transcription factor moving but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we need to get to the protein level
and add overlay the transcriptomic and the
[SPEAKER_00]: proteomics so far the limitation is that
with transcriptomic RNA and DNA you
[SPEAKER_00]: amplify you can start with very little
material with proteomics we are not yet
[SPEAKER_07]: there to get cell type specific proteomic
profile yeah so when you do that principal
[SPEAKER_07]: component analysis one of the questions
people always show principal component
[SPEAKER_07]: analysis but never tell us what the
components what were the basis the
[SPEAKER_07]: components that you're doing that and it
gets back to Josh's question because are
[SPEAKER_07]: there components of that gene expression
that you could more easily explain
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with making protoplasts than
anything else true so we are in the doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're telling for the project with
hookah and Terry long on ion deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: condition in flowing development we are
indeed looking more into the specific of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different PCA component for these it
was just a simple let's say way out to say
[SPEAKER_00]: well am I crazy or not that the stem cell
are different than non stem cell because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is actually the ground truth if they
would not have been different why to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that I'm doing so yeah but he's a
good point I just I just actually sat in
[SPEAKER_00]: the top that explaining exactly what
you're saying and I went to my postdoc and
[SPEAKER_00]: I say you need to look into these because
we need to really show for these other
[SPEAKER_00]: project yeah you're completely right
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah no it's beautiful question Elena so
they said parties that I really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: show the new set of data but they were
just too preliminary so well my graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: students and that goes back to your
question well my graduate student saw is
[SPEAKER_00]: that in another cells where they are both
expressed the quiescent center the
[SPEAKER_00]: stoichiometry is actually flipped around
and what we're seeing so we see that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have two scarecrow and one short and what
we are seeing is that you have a two short
[SPEAKER_00]: one scarecrow right starting when the cell
will be close to division so the stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: the cei the stem cell divides about 18 to
24 hour it divided symmetrically while the
[SPEAKER_00]: quiescent center is a less my topically
dividing cells but eventually divide the
[SPEAKER_00]: 72 hour or what I would like to see is for
example does this stoichiometry changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the quiescent center if we if we treat
with brassinosteroid the quiescent center
[SPEAKER_00]: divides faster so what we're trying to do
is to see if the stoichiometry changes if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a change in the cell division so
that we can link that and start to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation and then go after the
causation if it's really the stoichiometry
[SPEAKER_00]: underlined the timing of division or what
yeah we don't know we so that is why I
[SPEAKER_00]: like I hope I could show these data yes
please oh go ahead I'm not a serious
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I'm yeah is is a good point is so the
point there is rather than convince my mom
[SPEAKER_00]: that the world would be better fat is
message that I would like to send saying
[SPEAKER_00]: is always important to take five minutes
and see why we're doing what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's very basic what I'm doing is
basic biology and so if I were to tell my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom what I'm doing she will be shoot shoot
I don't get it but if I'm telling the big
[SPEAKER_00]: picture then she says oh I'm so proud of
you and so they hope is that we'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to but so this mainly for graduate student
and postdoc always try to feature your
[SPEAKER_00]: research in a broad context so that your
parents are proud and they give you
[SPEAKER_02]: present this has been a production of
Cornell University on the web at Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: edu you you you you you
