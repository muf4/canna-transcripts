[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're at Bristol's nursery and we're
going to be talking about production
[SPEAKER_00]: method, particularly container production
for our landscape jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically there are three different
types of production method.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, how you grow the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is bald and burlap, which is B&B,
which is a wire basket lined with burlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tree grows in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is container growing,
which we'll be talking about mostly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another one, which we'll see
in another video called bare root
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today we're going to concentrate on
container growing and what that means and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big advantages of container
growing is you're growing a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: lightweight media that I can pick up very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do try to do this with a soil medium,
it will be probably four times heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lightweight, easy to grow, you get a
very uniform product here in a container
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually grow it, plant it at any
time of the year because you take the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system with the plant in the plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big advantage for the grower
and for the contractor who's putting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's walk over here and see the different
container sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically we specify containers in
different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the smallest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use what's called a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is number two, number three,
and number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the different containers are
typically grown for small shrubs,
[SPEAKER_00]: understory, ground cover type work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into small trees,
you can actually get into larger sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a number 10 and then a number 15
and a number 20 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these are all cornice
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are grown in different container
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as these grow, they would be up potted
into a larger size container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they continue to grow and not become
restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the disadvantages of container
growing is that if you let the tree grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pot for too long, the roots can
become circled and restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about disadvantage of a
container growing is because we are on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lightweight, soilless media, sometimes
water movement between the soil less media
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ground can become restricted,
especially when you're doing this in
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are advantages and disadvantages,
but most of our plant material is grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, especially shrubs and ground
covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we'll see most of those plants
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just walking around the nursery
and we found these liner pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not typically what we plant,
but it could be for a particular job.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very small three inch square
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a seedling or a grafted plant in the
very young stages before it gets potted up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a larger size.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases we might want to use small
material in a job, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: typically what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nina just introduced us to the container
plant and talked a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: advantages and disadvantages and also
introduced the container size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we use the container size?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that relate to specifying and
design work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, really there's a relationship
between the size of the container and the
[SPEAKER_02]: size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might go without saying, but that
relationship is actually standardized in a
[SPEAKER_02]: common document called ANSI Z60.1,
the American Nursery Standard,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll share that document with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is it explains at regular
intervals what size root mass for a shrub
[SPEAKER_02]: plant like this relates to what size plant
above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a plant that's just been up potted
actually into the appropriate container
[SPEAKER_02]: size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually have two varieties of
plants here and two different size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're specifying what we would
like to have installed in a project,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're always going to talk about the size
of the plant, not the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important to understand that
there's a relationship there and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to see how that plays out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're specifying we also always use a
range interval to talk about the size we
[SPEAKER_02]: want because one plant in one container
class that would have one cost actually
[SPEAKER_02]: will be at a different range of sizes at
any given time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have three units that range
from 18 to 24 inches in a number five
[SPEAKER_02]: short container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this case we would specify,
you know, plant X, 18 to 24 inches and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what would show up on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so how does that relate to spacing
in the design knowing that you have this
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 to 24 inch high plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to show you an example of
like how these nine plants would lay out
[SPEAKER_02]: and what kind of spacing they would take
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this number five container with these
18 inch plants, it'd be typical to space
[SPEAKER_02]: them about two times the size of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have roughly three foot spacing
on center staggered.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to stagger and not lay out the
plants in a straight line like that and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll get more into that at another time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have the three foot spacing and
then up here in this number two class
[SPEAKER_02]: container with these plants between 12 to
maybe 15 inches, we're going to space them
[SPEAKER_02]: about 24 to 30 inches apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: To space them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going for here is a spacing
that will allow these plants in a
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively short amount of time actually
to grow together and colonize what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: a closed canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important then that we make sure
when we're specifying the plant size that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're thinking about plant spacing and
that relationship over time of how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow to colonize and occupy a
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: The result of them coming together and
growing into one monolithic mass is that
[SPEAKER_02]: with a closed canopy, they'll actually be
more self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll shade the root system,
which helps with water retention and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll out compete by shading the area of
growth in the open landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll actually reduce weed recruitment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll prevent weedy species from
invading.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we space them too far apart and they're
not able to, fill in that space and again,
[SPEAKER_02]: a relatively short period of time,
say one or two years of establishment with
[SPEAKER_02]: this open space available, we're going to
see other plants coming in and most
[SPEAKER_02]: typical installations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really not what we're looking for
is that random effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more like a typical spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These nine plants, we're looking at
something like, let's take a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: measure, probably about eight feet by
about six feet area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's about how they would lay out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've spoken a little bit about the
container plant and production techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: and methods, up potting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we talked a little bit about
design standards, spacing, specifying size
[SPEAKER_02]: and layout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now finally, we're going to talk about
the kind of the last stage of the journey
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant from the production facility,
maybe through a distributor's yard,
[SPEAKER_02]: but ultimately to a construction site
where it's going to be installed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now your plant has been loaded on a
truck at the production facility or
[SPEAKER_02]: contractor's yard and is coming to site.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you're going to want to be
there to inspect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we wrote the specification for this
plant, we required it to be of this
[SPEAKER_00]: certain size range and in this certain pot
size and on the truck, it's better to
[SPEAKER_00]: inspect this on the truck because no one
wants to reload.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything is rejected, to reload it on
the truck and take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the truck, we'd actually inspect the
plant for the size and pot size that we
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the health and condition of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not diseased or dead parts or
anything that would be rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we said that it's yes,
it's our size, it's our pot, it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to store the plant in an area
on the job site so that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: protected before planting occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often a very difficult time for
the plant because it had to be in a shady
[SPEAKER_00]: spot, mulched and watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Critically, it's important to water them,
realizing that in the nursery,
[SPEAKER_00]: these pots were watered every day because
of the lightweight medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of that stage where the
plant is on site and being stored and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: finally time to plant, you're going to
want to be there to achieve the layout
[SPEAKER_02]: that you specified, the correct spacing
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also now is the final opportunity to
do one last look at the plant after that
[SPEAKER_02]: storage period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this time, the plants are all going
to be un-potted and you're going to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This hydrangea here actually has a really
lovely, nice fibrous root network,
[SPEAKER_02]: not too dense, lots of clean white growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually nice fresh soil smell to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No dead material.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also it's not overly rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what we call pot bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be a condition where if the
plant has been in the pot too long,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually the roots will start to grow and
encircle around the perimeter of the pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: which forms a barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually this is a really nice looking
root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were pot bound or if there were
encircling roots, this would be another
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity for you to reject the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, this is a good plant and it's time
for it to go in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, once it's in the
ground, you own it.
