[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's PGA Championship Week.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the week we were probably
beginning to chat about Michael Black last
[SPEAKER_01]: year when he was at Oak Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was at Craigburn Golf Club
yesterday outside of East Aurora,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: An absolutely beautiful track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people were like this time
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were excited about the PGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who don't know, I think Jeff
Corcoran has moved on from that position
[SPEAKER_01]: as the superintendent at Oak Hill and now
has a consulting business with the former
[SPEAKER_01]: superintendent at Oakmont.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking forward to some good
golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drama ensues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they talk about is the baloney until
the golf starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, today, they'll just start
talking about the golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know Carl's got something to say
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a sucker for a good golf.
I'm a sucker for a good golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you talk about golf,
you know, I think about the dog picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: being a dog person myself, whenever you
can get the dogs to help out with
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancing your green speed or just the
love they have laying around the grass
[SPEAKER_01]: always makes me happy to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, as I mentioned
yesterday, I was with the golf course
[SPEAKER_01]: Superintendents Association of New York,
Joe Lucas, the president was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Holforth board member, Ron The
executive director was a really well
[SPEAKER_01]: attended, maybe 17, 20 folks there,
walking around a beautiful Robert Trent
[SPEAKER_01]: Jones Senior Golf Course, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really sort of very interesting and is
about to go through some greens extension
[SPEAKER_01]: and a bunker redo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so much like we're doing, and one of
the things that was really cool is he's
[SPEAKER_01]: got a POA nursery started about half an
acre of POA sod that he'll be producing
[SPEAKER_01]: that's needed for August of 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things that's
interesting, Terrence mentioned yesterday
[SPEAKER_01]: in the conversation was that, you know,
they started planning for this last year
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's been almost a two year process to
get a contractor and architect and people
[SPEAKER_01]: available to do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tyler Ray will be doing the renovation
at Craigburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, Carl, real diamond in the
rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't even know about this
place until I got out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the topics that came up
yesterday, which is really fascinating,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know one that we've begun to
discuss, he's got about 45 acres of high
[SPEAKER_01]: grass, fine fescue monocultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, he's been establishing
monocultures out there for a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: years and he'll be making a drone
application of herbicides to that
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Terrence really on the progressive edge
of managing these things, because
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously you can't drive through them
when you are, you know, growing them high
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He only mows them once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we've talked about managing the
high grass this way at Beth Page.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Carl, since it's golf this week,
you are our resident aficionado of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, your name was brought up
many times yesterday as the former
[SPEAKER_01]: champion, the Mid-Am champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were throwing that around yesterday
among the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you played out it when it
was at Craigburn that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you talk to us a little bit
about what's going to happen at Valhalla?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've got something to say about
this particular golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, every time there's a major
championship, Frank, people talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: golf course and they spend Monday through
Wednesday talking about what's the golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course going to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mentioned architects already and
Robert Jones Sr. was there at Craigburn,
[SPEAKER_00]: which there's a lot of places and players
at Craigburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They host a lot of New York State Golf
Association championships.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a certain crowd of golf
architecture folks who really like golden
[SPEAKER_00]: age architecture and firm and fast and
really wide fairways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call that strategic architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's penal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be sort of an R.T.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: classification heroic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some could argue R.T.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: invented heroic golf course architecture
and then strategic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like Friday golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of the media outlet who talks
about golf architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the strategic golden age
architecture courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this week at Valhalla is not one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Jack Nicholas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had this tweet the other day that
just sort of rubbed me the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Valhalla doesn't provide a thought
provoking test, nor does it take full
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of its property.
[SPEAKER_00]: The design fall short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to read the articles behind
a paywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, some of that stuff,
Frank, and I get why people like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: designs more than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start saying golf doesn't
provide a thought provoking test,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking, man, golf is there's a lot
of thought that goes into golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought about this famous interview
that Phil Mickelson does with David
[SPEAKER_00]: Faraday and people remember it's iconic
because Phil's got all black on and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got this leather black jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's a real sort of cool slick back
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, Faraday asks him, you know,
what do you think about in a golf shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Phil rattles off for five
straight minutes uninterrupted every
[SPEAKER_00]: single thing he thinks about when he's
about to hit a golf shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about the temperature
outside, the altitude you're playing at.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time of day is it in the morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in the afternoon?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball goes five yards shorter in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the wind?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the lie looking like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What height is the grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the grain of the grass facing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Distance, pin location, slope,
geometry of the green and we're bunkers
[SPEAKER_00]: and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's going on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh my God, this goes into
every single shot you hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, I just, I have to
process all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you list these things out,
Frank, eight of those 11 have nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the golf course architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think about thought provoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be in a flat field with a
circular green, putting a 15 handicap on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to still consider eight of these
11 things when they're playing golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, we, we often,
especially we're talking about golf
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about challenging a player
or making them think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, you know, golf is too
hard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're provoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're literally provoking golfers to the
point where they're taking divots and fads
[SPEAKER_00]: greens out there and Terry Hills,
or they're snapping clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sort of like, you know,
the, the emphasis on how you play a golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course and how you score is I guess one
thing you can analyze that at a pro level
[SPEAKER_00]: for a PGA championship or something like
that, but just for the everyday golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course, it'd be nice if we thought a
little bit beyond, you know, what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting on a golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other benefits we get just
as a recreational activity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of golfers are out there just
to have a good time for four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote about this, this is sort of a
shameless plug for an article I wrote in
[SPEAKER_00]: the recent GCSA NY newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I talk about, you know, there's all
these other positive aspects to golf that
[SPEAKER_00]: have nothing to do with golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about how you deal with your
score and things like physically walking
[SPEAKER_00]: around for four hours, how many calories
you burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that routinely, you get these
positive health outcomes over your
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Social cohesion, learning how to be with
strangers or your friends for four hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, sort of the summary of
the article is when we study urban green
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces and how parks makes us feel when we
can get out for a 10 minute or 15 minute
[SPEAKER_00]: walk in a park, we, we measure people,
you know, their anxiety, their stress
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, and they always go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, 10 minutes, 15 minutes in green space
is really good for your sort of mental
[SPEAKER_00]: wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So golf is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do it for four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely when people come off a golf course,
they should be less stressed and have less
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that's not always the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of folks who studied
this, Parker Anderson has a thesis on this
[SPEAKER_00]: from, from his graduate work is now they
don't come off with less stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes they come out with more
stress and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're focusing on,
on their score and their performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just what I was wrapping this up today
is, you know, it'd be nice if we could get
[SPEAKER_00]: our golfers to think a little bit more
about sort of being out there in a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, looking at things,
taking in that, that beautiful landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass, the trees, the animals that are
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a superintendent or steward of the
property, maybe you can sort of cue your
[SPEAKER_00]: golfers because, because they're going to
forget, they're not going to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: those when, when they're left to their own
devices, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's their ball going?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some signage or something,
maybe you can say, Hey, here's a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: vista.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look out at this, you know, mountain in
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's X mountain or, Hey, look at this
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is a unique tree in our
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to cue golfers to like,
you know, this is a natural landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a lawn is or a sports field or a
park or cemetery, trying to get people to
[SPEAKER_00]: think a little bit more about just the
golf score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's my rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, Carl, cause when I hear you
talk, I remember the podcast I did with
[SPEAKER_01]: Parker Anderson, who did that study at
Michigan, who said basically golfers
[SPEAKER_01]: barely know they're outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so emphasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you, when I read that thing
that you sent over and like thought
[SPEAKER_01]: provoking, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm overthinking a three foot gimme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I think I understand what they
mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, and I know
there's a whole culture of, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to call them golf snobs, but it certainly
is this sort of intellectual approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at a golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and I, you know, I almost think
you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the problem is we're, we're over,
we're overthinking it, but to your point,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we feed this, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially those in this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think golf superintendents, rightfully
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm at Craigburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the hazel teen of,
of Western New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all scratch golfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they play 10, 12,000 rounds a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's all about the score
and the betting and the this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm not suggesting that any of
those things happen, but we know they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think the superintendent then
gets sucked into, I got to produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: golf course, you know, for those people,
cause they barely, I got to remind them to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're not even going to look when
they're playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think, you know, there's that
there's a part of the business that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we, we respond to, but at the
end of the day, Carl, they're allowed his
[SPEAKER_01]: voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why I'm so excited
about this, kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data one screaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the greens are slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd be, I'd love to see a
superintendent when somebody comes up and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, you know, the greens,
you know, don't feel so good today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but isn't that view over the lake
really beautiful?
[SPEAKER_01]: That says no golf superintendent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think we have to have a balance
for these things, but you're exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, so the sort of public conversation
that goes around around golf sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for architectural stuff,
just completely eludes me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad for you as a,
you know, a really good golfer saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we should, we should enjoy this being
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know part of that's coming from,
you don't get out yet to get out as much
[SPEAKER_01]: now being a parent, every time you're out
there being outside with the kid and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dog is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not as fussed about your score
as you used to be, but you can remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the day when score was all that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me a lot of stress and anxiety,
but at the same time, now that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned, you know, and when I look at the
data to the Frank, it's like, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, maybe I should just sort of enjoy
being out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet people will have lower scores if
they just sort of relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man, it's just, it's not unheard of
either car, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was at the U S open in
2018, going around Shinnecock,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, I was partnered with the
superintendent at Sergio Garcia's golf
[SPEAKER_01]: course in Spain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sergio Garcia, think of him what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's an enormously gifted,
talented golfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he maybe didn't win as much as
everybody thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kid goes to the golf course for like a
half an hour with his father.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets a little waggle, hits a few balls,
puts a few balls and he's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he's a field guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, there's guys that want to grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also hear Scottie Scheffler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go out for two hours after the
round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm like, yeah, I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even at the highest level,
you hear this back and forth about
[SPEAKER_01]: managing the stress that you put on
yourself to be exceptional at a game that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to shoot in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Tiger Woods shoots an eight on a
given day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably not even what some people
would even think a very hard golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I do think there is something
about golf courses, golf course people and
[SPEAKER_01]: golfers that want to be challenged to the
point of like, you know, you got to put a
[SPEAKER_01]: sign up like you do at Beth Page.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to some of the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a generally cool week, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think many people would say we're still
in a bit of a stall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think grass is growing, but here's where
I can tell you, as soon as the foot gets
[SPEAKER_01]: on the pedal for warmth and you keep
getting these warm nights, grass,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to start hitting that surge of
growth period we normally get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: springtime with many of our cool season
grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been warming up rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're making your soil drench
applications for fairy wing, you're late
[SPEAKER_01]: for summer patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably right on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you use the full rate and make
sure you put it on with a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to rain, spray it in the
rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely positively.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one reason these things fail is
they do not get deep enough in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're putting this thing on soils
that water doesn't move through very well,
[SPEAKER_01]: put a wetting agent in with it to help it
sort of penetrate and make its way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still is going to be challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, summer patch is one of those
diseases that we don't know we got a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem until later in the season when the
stress comes and worse yet, the infection
[SPEAKER_01]: periods are longer and longer and the
stress is going deeper into the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a reminder, we were diagnosing,
Rich Buckley was diagnosing summer patch
[SPEAKER_01]: into October last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you want to get this early,
but you also want to keep track of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stress levels that your plants are under,
particularly from summer patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out Western New York and the first
comment I made when we started was,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, it's been a fairly uneventful spring
to which Terrence said we got seven inches
[SPEAKER_01]: of rain in the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oops, I guess I wasn't paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has actually been, if you look at
the map here, fairly wet in the last month
[SPEAKER_01]: in Western New York, even though I was
thinking it's somewhat on the dry side,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at 200% of normal from
EREPA all the way up into Rochester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the other end of the spectrum
in the New York metropolitan area,
[SPEAKER_01]: the last month is looking at 25 to 50%,
75% of normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of dry areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for the two people that live in
northern Maine, Carl, probably related to
[SPEAKER_01]: you somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dry up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say south into Delmarva,
the Delmarva peninsula.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was down for the Virginia Tech
graduation last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to miss you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the dry side down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it looks like we're going to have
normal conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we're going to have pretty
normal temperatures for the next eight to
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what we're seeing of this sort
of sporadic rainfall and just warm enough
[SPEAKER_01]: is as we're going to talk about in a
second, going to start to drive growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start to drive diseases like
dollar spot, which looks like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to rear its head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Carl, I went to your growth potential
thing, and I thought it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting this past week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Kreiser was taught, we were chatting
with Bill and Bill was talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: growth potential as really a measure of
the way plants make sugars, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really a measure of how they can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how they can produce sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's played around with looking at the
impact of temperature on growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could have high growth potential,
but not have enough moisture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl, here's your model on a clay soil
that demonstrated right when the rainfalls
[SPEAKER_01]: came through with no irrigation,
you had growth in the plots last week or
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it looked like it just sat there
and now it looks like moisture is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: again, temperatures are rising,
and in a clay soil, we're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into moderate growth and probably heading
towards the surge of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same model corrected for a sandy
well-drained soil indicates you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get that growth surge by any
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I think we've started to learn,
and Carl, you know, I want to just take a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute here and have you chat about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the springtime has not been your
favorite time for this model that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not always getting the surge, but boy,
this feels right now based on what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing in dry areas, they're not growing
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will also add, if you have areas
where things are growing very well and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting a lot of traffic,
traffic is a beautiful growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of heavily trafficked turf in
the last few days that just simply wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: growing as much as the turf right next to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was bluegrass dense,
and then next to it, it was about an inch
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half higher simply because people
were walking there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, other than compaction and
traffic, not much is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk a little bit, Carl, about the
growth model in the spring and this sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of disparity that I'm showing here between
the two soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a general structure of these
models is essentially there's an optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature that you'll put in and the
original pace turf growth model was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, hey, we expect optimum growth at
about 67 degrees Fahrenheit for cool
[SPEAKER_00]: season grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what this model uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also consider what's the
available soil moisture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because generally speaking, the amount of
top growth you get will be governed by how
[SPEAKER_00]: much water is sort of moving through that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need evapotranspiration and you need
available water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have clay soils that hold more
water, that's why this model is generally
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have more growth in those areas
versus sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cool thing about talking about
Bill last week, he's got this nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: responsiveness index that he calls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with the rye grasses early
in the year, we find that top growth is
[SPEAKER_00]: not correlated to sort of photosynthetic
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say 67 degrees Fahrenheit,
optimum temperature at which
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis occurs, that's the
production of carbohydrates, storage of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then how the plant distributes that
energy is governed by sort of different
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for rye grass, that's more like 60
degrees is when it starts saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we're going to use that energy on top
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think one of the reasons we've
seen this model not do so great in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring is because, especially on plots
with rye grass, we have that temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: set a little bit too high, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's pretty good for tall
fescue, like that tall fescue,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to skew more towards
the warmer end when it grows at an optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a good growth rate for tall
fescue, but for something like rye grass
[SPEAKER_00]: or poa, which starts coming out early in
the spring, it probably is under rating
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of growth you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the interesting things
that came out of our conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, Carl, I mean, if you have
sandy soils and you have the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: dry them out, that is going to be,
again, another effective growth regulator
[SPEAKER_01]: in the golf world is letting them dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, as you let them dry out,
you have to be careful about soil breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: and isolated dry spots and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go for drying things out,
which is something we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: in this conversation this time last year
when we were going through the really dry
[SPEAKER_01]: weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, when you're thinking about
growth, historically, we think of a very
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of traditional growth model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something Al Turgeon and the late
great Joe Vargas proposed many years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: annual bluegrass, really pretty steady
growth except through the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really starting to rethink a lot
of things about annual bluegrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial type, annual type, but one thing
for sure, it grows different than creeping
[SPEAKER_01]: bank grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I was looking at some pretty
heavily regulated fairways yesterday,
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, over at Craig Bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrence is not shy on his using of the
new growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, you could really see the
difference in the dramatic regulation that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting on the annual bluegrass and
not much regulation on the creeping bank
[SPEAKER_01]: grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't say he's actively trying to
remove the annual bluegrass, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: are, I saw some things with the new
yesterday and we've seen some speculation
[SPEAKER_01]: about this from Scott McElroy and Bill
Kreiser that a new might have some
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to take out annual bluegrass
like an herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people have been
thinking about this for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it is something to consider as
we start to try to manage annual bluegrass
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanna talk a little bit about
growth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we talk about growth potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just reminding people,
cause I've gotten so used to seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: over-regulated turf in the spring in
Northern climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's good to remind everybody
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what Bill has been developing
for many years at Greenkeeper are these
[SPEAKER_01]: growing degree day model, that will track
the amount of regulation that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you need to reapply knowing
that the plant and the soil are processing
[SPEAKER_01]: these plant growth regulators and you can
measure their effectiveness by monitoring
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now yesterday Terrence uses 230 growing
degree days for all of his PGR
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I would say he builds his entire
program around when he makes his growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does that with his PGR application,
which I thought was really, really
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshing to see and also creates an
alternative to the banter we normally get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a good old Joe Lucas was there
yesterday ready to give me a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Terrence was all over the growing
degree day thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he talked about how bad the rebound
can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with not many rounds and not a lot
of pressure, he's nimble to spray on a
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday morning or a Sunday morning or a
Wednesday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have the flexibility,
you can really follow this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what I want to say here is if
you look carefully at these lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see trim it is the most dramatic
regulation followed by a new and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: lightest amount of regulation at use rates
is primo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can moderate these rates
based the amount of regulation based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the rate of the product, but the frequency
of the application continues to be what
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now again, for those of you watching us
live or watching the video of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have a really good depiction here
of what over regulation can look like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting on herbicides, fungicides,
growth regulators that all have growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be regulating up to 80% of your
growth, which is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of the things I saw yesterday
is they were mowing fairways after two
[SPEAKER_01]: days of growth and you couldn't find the
clipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't ever want to underestimate the
value of really regulating, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: fairways where you got 25 acres,
you're mowing them three days a week and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you got to go out and blow them if
your growth regulators aren't working
[SPEAKER_01]: right because you got clippings all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really important part of
managing growth in the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially during the surge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, speaking of surges, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't seen it yet, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find out how good your
seedhead suppression is in the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks as the flush of growth starts to
come on throughout the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the New York metropolitan area
is well into its heavy flush and the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of the state is about to experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a really good time to keep
track of your seedhead suppression
[SPEAKER_01]: programs that, as just a reminder,
get locked in in the fall and then
[SPEAKER_01]: supported through the early spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, every spring, we haven't talked
about it much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's sort of a testament to
something Ben told us last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Annual Bluegrass Weevil is now moving to
the secondary problem status from being a
[SPEAKER_01]: primary problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are out there looking around,
you'll see the rhododendron starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good time for your larvicide
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that pay attention to the
Syngenta Greencast blog that Ben puts out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see that basically with a warm
spell at the end of April has accelerated
[SPEAKER_01]: stage two, which means stages one and two
are coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might be making an early instar and
a late instar at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to pay attention to this
application, especially if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: making adulticide applications anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: This larvicide is your sole chance to get
control Now, thankfully, we're not as dry
[SPEAKER_01]: as we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grass is humming along pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always know Annual Bluegrass Weevil
damage tends to be worse when there's
[SPEAKER_01]: other stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully we can grow through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think when we're coming at the
end of seedheads, you see a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: decline in your Annual Bluegrass
population because all those tillers that
[SPEAKER_01]: flower die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get normal thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get the potential for Annual
Bluegrass Weevil problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to keep track of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think these are times when if you
start pushing it, especially when it's wet
[SPEAKER_01]: and soft and you start causing some
physical or mechanical damage to those
[SPEAKER_01]: putting surfaces, I am sure you're going
to see anthracnose no matter how many
[SPEAKER_01]: things you spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start to cause that stress,
if you're getting a little night light
[SPEAKER_01]: with nitrogen because you're freaking out
about green speed early, maybe you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: little overregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised to see anthracnose
jump and show its unsightly head.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more things before I close up and
we maybe take some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reminder, we're in the midst of no
mome, which means lawn should be flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: like crazy based on our risk assessment
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really what it's going to look
like for a while now, right, Carl,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the clover population beginning to
come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a healthy reminder, we say if
you're going to apply anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you mow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also want to make sure that after
you mow those flowers are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not, do not apply things to
that lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, making an application,
especially an insecticide, which we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: that window now between dandelion and
clover flowering, maybe where you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: your grub control down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I tell you is kill the
damn weeds first.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you're going to do,
get rid of the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a flowering lawn, don't start
applying insecticides to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we've been on and on about
no mome, but soon June 1 will come and
[SPEAKER_01]: then this is what is awaiting everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be very interesting to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of online citizen science
research projects going on that we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I wrap it up, Carl, we got this
picture from our pal, Dr. Sitko,
[SPEAKER_01]: the director of a golf and sports turf
here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dollar spot's underway and our models
indicating this is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you have areas that are of high
risk and high value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's maybe a little bit earlier
than I thought it was going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also moving into a point where
high value turf's probably going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: some protection from this dollar spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Carl, that's what I got for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions or other things we want to
cover before we get out of here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't see any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll show data next week,
Frank, but it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about no mome for a couple of
years now and I don't see the Google
[SPEAKER_00]: trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on this Google trends page and
look at search terms like no mome and see
[SPEAKER_00]: the relative sort of intensity of search
terms over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not seeing it at the same level
as we have been seeing it the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, is that due to the Cornell turf
show talking about the science behind no
[SPEAKER_00]: mome?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if, you know, correlation is
not causation, but we are seeing a trend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, of people being a little more
strategic in how they're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators that are just sort of letting
grass grow and then chopping it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, as we wrap up in the golf
section, Carl, just want to tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday the bunker conversation came up
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting when you get a group
of superintendents together, the topic
[SPEAKER_01]: around lying and mining, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cloth, sod, billy bunker, cap con.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's white sand, dark sand,
what kind of sand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's hand rake, mechanical rake,
Australian method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, particularly Craigburn,
they're going to really go through,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got some aerials that show these very
jagged tooth bunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrence kept saying pasa tiempo like sort
of bunkers that honestly are not very
[SPEAKER_01]: Trent Jonesy, but they've got these images
from 69 that show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just another shout out to golf course
superintendents about keeping people
[SPEAKER_01]: mindful of the amount of time and energy
you're spending in these hazards and how
[SPEAKER_01]: much it contributes to the overall sort of
labor demands that a golf course has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrence is about 27 to 29 guys on an 18
hole property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he puts those bunkers in,
he's going to need every one of them based
[SPEAKER_01]: on what I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a shout out again to everybody
working on bunker stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of this hidden cost that we know
about and everybody complains about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think impacts the whole operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's data now and Adam Engel at
Lakeshore was telling us a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: superintendents per acre bunkers take the
same amount or cost the same amount as
[SPEAKER_00]: putting greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about the relative
importance of those two surfaces to the
[SPEAKER_00]: golf experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite equal, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next Thursday for,
I think is our final scheduled turf show
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might do a bonus episode here or
there, but we'll definitely have a guest
[SPEAKER_01]: next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
