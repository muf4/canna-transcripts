[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a privilege to be back at
Cornell University in this very same room
[SPEAKER_00]: to have memories of the very distinguished
speakers and learning from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this loud enough and is it in a good
position?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go ahead and get started and
attempt to leave as much time as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: for discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I doing this right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if it's capable of moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have to stand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, I like to start with a
list of all the private sector funding
[SPEAKER_00]: I've received to talk about genetic
engineering and CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the list right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important because, in fact,
I've never done CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never engineered a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an outsider to this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that gives me a certain degree
of perspective, which might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having received funds to do genetic
engineering is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's how you become experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say honestly that I don't have
any conflicts of interest in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's so controversial,
I think it's important to make sure that's
[SPEAKER_00]: clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my motivations, I've learned that it's
probably good to be explicit about my
[SPEAKER_00]: motivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that the wise use of CRISPR
technologies and genetic engineering can
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the common good through
increased food security and more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my motivation for coming to
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, through the Alliance for Science,
most of all in this case, but for this as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll get through it because some of
these topics are rather short.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR, genetic engineering, and disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read it for yourselves,
starting with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just say a few things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, plant transformation has
been accomplished largely by two
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies that have been very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to use agrobacterium and natural
genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second was to use the gene gun
particle bombardment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are very familiar with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And am I still speaking loud enough if I
talk like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those have been useful technologies in
introducing genetic constructs of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: in random locations in the genome,
but nevertheless useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR, I think, first of all,
let me explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read it briefly and then distinguish
it from plant transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two elements to the CRISPR
nanomachine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we could think of it as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange bubbly thing is the Cas9
site-specific nuclease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gray to green structure there is
the single-guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working together, the guide RNA leads
the Cas9 to a particular site based on
[SPEAKER_00]: Watson-Crick-based pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it cleaves at a particular location in
that double-stranded DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what the Cas9 single-guide
RNA does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's what happens after that results
in gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we've got a double-stranded
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cell is going to repair that as
quickly as possible, sometimes often
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing an insertion or a deletion of
a small number of nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll refer to why that's important in just
a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you include into the same cell a
template that has homology to both sides
[SPEAKER_00]: of this cut but has this blue gene that's
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can introduce an additional
genetic construct into the breakpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to imagine that that blue
gene that we've introduced has some value
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of conferring disease resistance,
then that would be easy to imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: that could contribute to disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, though, I want to comment
on because we're introducing indels into a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're causing disruption to the
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why would that be important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you target a susceptibility
gene and introduce an indel there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then if you've done that across all
homeoalleles for that plant, this is wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, which is a hexapoid,
then you've created a resistant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the ways that actually
this is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got two ways, general ways,
that could introduce disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple ways that the CRISPR,
the Cas9 cellulite RNA, can be introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: into a eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one that, without going into those
in detail, we have more time for
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one that caught my attention the
most is represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is actually where there's no
introduction of DNA into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the combination of the Cas9
represented as purple, the Cas9 N,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cas9 enzyme, and the single-guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are joined together in a
ribonucleoprotein, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: transfected into protoplasts or introduced
by the gene guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's been described as
DNA-free gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just an interesting
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other ways that the Cas9 and
the single-guide RNA can be introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I think is notable about
CRISPR gene editing is people have
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully multiplexed with multiple
single-guide RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually target several genes at
one time in the same cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are some of the important
features of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, most important, I think,
is the precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This introduces very targeted,
and specific breaks that occur at specific
[SPEAKER_00]: locations or insertions that occur at
defined locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that distinguishes it from the
previous forms of plant genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It introduces flexibility, because not
only are we introducing a particular gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can delete a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can delete a fragment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use targeted mutations or create
targeted mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more that you can accomplish
than previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, reported by researchers is a
predictable type of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I see researchers commonly
referring to it as democratizing genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, because that it's rather
simple to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been subject to discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a researcher once say,
well, once recently actually said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you actually have to optimize CRISPR
for every given plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's really no different in this
respect than plant transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enough people have said it that I
think it's worth at least mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one wrinkle that I think is worth
talking about, and hopefully we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: time for others as you wish, is this
concept of off-target mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we have the guide RNA
represented in a DNA strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the RNA that will guide the CRISPR
to a particular target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to match this sequence
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other parts in this genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other locations in this genome
where there's not quite a perfect match,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is the possibility of annealing
of the single-guide RNA, resulting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: break, a cut, in a target that is not
actually the target for the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are called off-target
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you read at least the popular
literature, they're raised as concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I published this in a blog and had it
peer-reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, in plants, what I see in the
literature is that the reported off-target
[SPEAKER_00]: rates are quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are additional papers that I can
cite now and add to that number of 13
[SPEAKER_00]: citations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems pretty uncommon in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are strategies for reducing
off-target mutations, and these continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to be published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off-target mutations, number three,
can be monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out if they're there through
whole genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, in sexually reproducing crops,
undesired mutations can be segregated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, I think it makes a lot of
sense in a clinical situation for human
[SPEAKER_00]: disease control and therapeutics to avoid
off-target mutations, if we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with plants, I'm not sure I see the
risk, because in breeding of all sorts,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a lot of off-target changes
beyond the particular genetic change that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that never has raised a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if there are off-target mutations,
infrequent though they might be,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are detrimental to the plant,
we select those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do want to bring attention to this
paper here, which is just published a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, not published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a preprint server, so it's not
been published in the journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they documented, seemingly,
in a well-done way, to my eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: translocation and chromosome duplication,
portions of a chromosome being duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They documented both of those as a result
of CRISPR Cas9 editing in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still think the same response
applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a problem to implants,
particularly since we select and test the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's an area that's worth
paying attention to, and certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see where this leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, genetic engineering and disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll flash through just a few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I published a paper in the
journal Sustainability on genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering from my perspective as an
applied plant pathologist, and went
[SPEAKER_00]: through and actually described the
different strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe I'll show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is open access, by the way,
if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so these top 10 strategies were
described in the paper and cited with
[SPEAKER_00]: examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then promptly, within a few months of
publication, there were a couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies that were published.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that within each of these
strategies, you have a pretty wide
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape of possibilities for engineering
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got a dozen, at least,
strategies for engineering resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to be impressed by the
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say there aren't concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot we know we can do
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not all of it would be workable in
the field, but some of it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my conclusion from the literature and
talking to experts is gene editing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems to be capable of providing all
the transgenic and all the cisgenic types
[SPEAKER_00]: of resistance that have been published as
a result of genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also provide targeted
mutations, large deletions, and allele
[SPEAKER_00]: substitutions, which was not, to my
knowledge, possible before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics and crop pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to draw on my experiences
as an applied plant pathologist in Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orbeer's program.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, maybe I should point out
that among the three categories of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, there's herbicide,
which is the largest category of use of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are old data, but still we're in the
ballpark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insecticides and miticides represent the
second category, and fungicides and other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals for disease control are
represented in the third category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take the first one, and that is
herbicide tolerant crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could CRISPR play a role in reducing
herbicides is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way might be to engineer plants
for herbicide tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at a recent review paper on
the use of CRISPR research or publication
[SPEAKER_00]: of results in using CRISPR, yield was the
principal focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biofortification was number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number three is herbicide tolerance,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty high on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the large scale manufacturers
are using this in their research programs
[SPEAKER_00]: to create plants that are resistant to
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the experience with
Roundup Ready crops, glyphosate tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that picture tells it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been engineered to
resist an herbicide that would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: kill all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very useful technology,
very useful to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to ask a farmer,
why do you use this technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the one side of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we have glyphosate resistant
marestail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the species that's resistant
to glyphosate in many parts of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the technology has been useful
to farmers, it's fair to refer to this as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a pesticide treadmill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it end, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk more about glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is, that I don't think CRISPR
represents a near term solution to the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge of reducing herbicide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, let me add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a couple of other possibilities
for the use of CRISPR to reduce herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: use is represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes for allelopathy can be introduced
into another species of a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the roots of the plant become a
source of a toxin to weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being done with sorgolion from
Sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a research capacity, it's not anything
I see as near term commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about fitness suppressing gene
drives, engineering the weed to spread a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene drive within its population that is
fitness suppressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being done in a research capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nowhere near commercial use of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of issues to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bottom line is, I don't see CRISPR as
providing a solution with respect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction of herbicide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, with respect to insecticides,
miticides, and disease control chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion, from where I stand,
is this is low hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is low hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, think back to all the possibilities
that I described before, knowing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, there'll be challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very underutilized
technology in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a slide from Orange County,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with Jim Warbeer for five years
on onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this toasty, crispy onion plot is from
natural inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we asked the grower to do was turn off
the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the kind of disease pressure
that was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, they're going to have a good
reason to use fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that level of susceptibility
in the commercial realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to start with that sort of
fundamental notion that there could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big demand for it that's hard to
dispute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principle that this represents is
shown in the title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is complete resistance can
displace the need for pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different turf grass varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got a very destructive root
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one has got the same soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, it's resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, against that disease,
if you want to control fungicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be spraying a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, this would be a much better
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This case does involve genetic
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cisgenic approach to controlling
late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these plants are engineered with
that cis gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, it's the plant that's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, complete resistance can
displace the need for pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is fundamentally
really well-known among applied plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another case from genetic
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is insecticide use in corn has gone
down dramatically since the introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: of BT traits for insect control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I think, entirely attributable to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other parts of the world,
we've seen similar reductions in
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide use with BT crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: BT brinjal or eggplant in Bangladesh has
been widely adopted by farmers because
[SPEAKER_00]: they typically have read this in multiple
places, scholarly sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, they would be spraying 70 to 80
times a growing season or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say there aren't issues and
concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that there can be
reductions in pesticide use from genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's surprised by that who works
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this example from Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bacterial spot of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have the same variety with the
same variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a single gene for pathogen
recognition, a single receptor that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I understand it, the only reason
this hasn't yet been commercialized is
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't know how to handle the
public relations challenge of a GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, they published it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what they're doing presently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what our growers do in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have much bacterial
spot here in this climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're spraying copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And copper is not good for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for the workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, in my opinion, this is
actually more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a paper by Bill Fry going back
to 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, really kind of a classic paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he did was he plotted the apparently
in infection rates against fungicide dose
[SPEAKER_00]: for two varieties, a more susceptible
variety, russet rural, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: called, and sabago here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this differential, there's a slight
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the differential is different along
different parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this differential shows the savings
achievable in fungicide as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: this partial resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So complete resistance is a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have complete resistance,
we can reduce pesticides to zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, sometimes, depending on the
circumstances here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even partial resistance can reduce the
need for fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that paper shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is well established that genetic
engineering can produce disease-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetic solutions can displace
pesticides for control of diseases and
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, I think, well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if genetics are underutilized,
then how do we do it sustainably?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to talk about
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there are two fundamental
ways that we can use genetics sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say sustainable, I mean for the
indefinite future.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do it for the indefinite future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I have all the answers,
but I'm going to offer what I think about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it all depends on diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to use genetic resources is to
not depend just on genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure to deploy a diversity and
control tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a name for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Integrated Path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to talk about
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to this list from my
paper in sustainability two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, there are a lot of things that
we're going to talk about next.
So let's go back to this list from my
paper in sustainability two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of strategies that can lead
to the production of plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, with each of these
strategies, I don't know what the limit
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to the particular applications
that microbiologists might concede.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really see the potential for a lot of
diversity in the genetic mechanisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by diversity in gene
deployment is on the list I'm about to
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, use diverse mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use diverse mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BT trait has been used heavily for
multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, the best way to protect the BT
trait is to have another genetic trait
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a distinct mechanism from BT and
that targets the same path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diverse mechanisms is one way to slow
pathogen adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate from that, why not target
multiple targets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm assuming we're in a world where
GMOs are not considered necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: intrinsically harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a world where society is willing to
utilize technology systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not there, but I'm going to talk
about it from the standpoint of biology
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'll go forward as the public
wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But multiple targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw an interesting paper on
reductions of that, really actually pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising reductions in aflatoxin
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they targeted three points on the
particular gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not do that against other pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Target multiple sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it basically harder for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogen to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene pyramiding, this is a concept that is
not certainly novel to genetic engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: or CRISPR, but it certainly would be
easier to implement through the use of a
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR engineered construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least for annuals and biennials,
why not rotate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, assuming that the public is willing
to have us use diverse genetic techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in corn, for example,
I don't know if this is naive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seems to me that you could build
in, actually this goes back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-lines work that I've read about when
I was a graduate student and thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, why not have every five years,
you rotate to a different set of genes for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance against X disease and you just
build that into your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's worth pointing out that high
throughput gene discovery and cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques just expand the landscape even
more, allowing us to implement this
[SPEAKER_00]: principle of diversity in gene deployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think all of these are possible
through conventional breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're probably facilitated through
genetic engineering, including through,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially through CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe from my perspective,
the gene editing is likely to permit more
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid breeding responses to evolving
pathogen populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, but we've always got to think,
now I am excited about the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: the wise use of CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's pretty hard to hide that,
but our job is, as scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to be willing to look at the full
picture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of what will happen in the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a biologist, this one certainly
catches my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least for a period of time,
there was only one BT toxin event used in
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, again, it's pretty easy to
imagine that that kind of widespread use
[SPEAKER_00]: of a single gene construct could represent
a risk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I credit Roy Millar, for those of
you remembering him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught a wonderful five, I think it was
a 500 level course that was grueling with
[SPEAKER_00]: the laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, did I learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Southern Corn Leaf Blight is a
disease that still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 1970, what happened was a very
severe epidemic developed in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States due to the presence of,
so there's the epidemic in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not fall coloration,
because you can see those trees are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an epidemic that happened
throughout much of the corn growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worse yet, the infection progressed
into the grain itself, which was unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that a mitochondrial
gene, there it is identified, a
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial gene that conferred
cytoplasmic male sterility actually also
[SPEAKER_00]: had a pleiotropic effect in conferring
hyper susceptibility to an unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: strength of Southern Corn Leaf Blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this genetic, and this is all natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the result of conventional
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not picking on genetic
engineering or conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this natural genetic trait was what
predisposed, unknown in advance,
[SPEAKER_00]: was predisposed the crop to this epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the widespread use of a
particular genetic construct could lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: an unexpected outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to recognize that as biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, my opinion is that the
sustainable use of genetic research
[SPEAKER_00]: resources for disease control actually
puts more, would depend on greater
[SPEAKER_00]: reliance on genetic knowledge and
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not less knowledge and not less
application, but greater reliance as
[SPEAKER_00]: you've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, social considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna go into the deeply,
but I think it's important to give voice
[SPEAKER_00]: to the social dimension of these
technologies and a lovely one that social
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists ask is who decides where to use
the technology and when.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there is an easy answer
to that, but it's a good thing to wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: as biologists who decides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who benefits before we use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who might be the beneficiary?
[SPEAKER_00]: At what rate is it used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't think, I know the answers
to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who might be disadvantaged?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does genetic engineering promote food
access?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the things that are
interesting most.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that contribute to
sustainability in a social sense or an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I think it's important to
think beyond and talk beyond just the
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate roundup ready trait that's the
most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other dimensions that I think
is important to recognize as biologists is
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that trans gene flow,
recognizing trans genes are genes from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the breeding pool and the flow of
trans genes could represent a risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To environments or the environment or
cultural risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't have the easy answer for
this one either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are Campesino farmers in
Nicaragua and they produce their own
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we get trans gene flow with a
roundup ready trait into their variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it occurs at low percentages,
and even if it has no agronomic impact
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever, they don't want it in their
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've got to recognize that as
an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That applies to trans genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the same applies if we
engineered our corn with a cis gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is from the breeding pool of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the same applies if we
create a deletion or an indel causing
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting mutations, because all of those
things can happen naturally in the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pool of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of trans genes,
I think this represents an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: a social risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all applications of, oh,
yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is another point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of my good friends are more
concerned about the impact of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic engineering on smallholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is saving his seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could he save the seed if it was a
genetically engineered crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the United States,
no, at least not until the product is off
[SPEAKER_00]: patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's sort of a social
consideration, not a biological one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's important nevertheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all applications of genetic
engineering are harmful to smallholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a few examples done with
smallholders in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work, the VIRCA project, is to create
disease resistance against cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they do others in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the one that got my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they categorically must distribute
those genetic traits once they're publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must distribute those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must distribute them freely and to
allow them to be shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are acute poisonings,
incidence of acute poisonings among cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BT, of course, is the engineered
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And non-BT is non-engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the incidence of no poisonings was
much higher for those who had the BT crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't spraying as many
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that all the way up through to
all these different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incidence of multiple poisonings was
lower where they used BT because they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't dependent on insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the same kind of data from
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's an example of how not all
examples of genetic engineering are
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful to smallholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that, again, caught my
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was work, again, with cotton,
biotech cotton, BT cotton in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reports that the women farmers
actually preferred the BT cotton because
[SPEAKER_00]: it saved them time and it allowed them to
have less cost in hiring somebody to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: their cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some reflections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to end up with 20 at time,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get oversprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had it all planned out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's from Orange County,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we want to reduce pesticides
against diseases in insects, we must give
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of any other way as an
applied plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a producer, a smallholder producer
in Nicaragua, and he's spraying chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was actually spraying,
no protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to see him have an option
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's probably going to keep spraying
until he has an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, options mean some
sort of genetic solution, genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, conventional breeding,
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took all these pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in Nicaragua as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little girl was about 10 meters
from that rice field, which gets treated
[SPEAKER_00]: by airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a bad situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to see options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want this grower to stop using
pesticides from the air, we have to give
[SPEAKER_00]: him or her alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have spent, it's still hard to
believe, 35 years working with pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: for disease control, starting in 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working that long with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most applied plant
pathologists would agree that host plant
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance is the principal pathway to
reducing pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not saying it necessarily has
to be CRISPR, but we need genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not getting enough of them at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: My perception is that CRISPR-based gene
editing is it opens doors to engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistance, and sometimes with
advantages compared to transformation or
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it gives us an opportunity to
target crops that are heavily dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, as we saw some slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've got what looks like just
about maybe 15 to 20 minutes to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave it to you to start that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back.
That's a great job.
Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You presented genome editing squarely in
the context of genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the subset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
And I think that's accurate.
And I think it's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an easy concept for biologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to public perception,
some people would argue that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: important to distinguish genetic
engineering as referring to gene gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's one of those
things that I'm probably as interested I
[SPEAKER_00]: am as interested in hearing what you think
about it as what ever I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we describe these technologies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may change my mind on the plane home
after the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of outreach on this topic
with the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually ask for about an hour and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that period of time, I have the
leisure to be able to talk using some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty useful graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is genetic engineering?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is CRISPR?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is it used?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there can be some overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outcomes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tended to describe it all as
genetic engineering to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as people understand and get
comfortable with how genetic engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: is like copying and pasting sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy from this file, paste to that file,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sentence is the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've just placed it into another
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody knows how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, OK, it's not that
mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they understand that, it almost doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which language, whether I call it genetic
engineering or precision breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is I have an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times, you have 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to present it transparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems as a scientist to be under the
large umbrella of genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that might scare people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to convey the idea of the
accuracy of the phrase genetic engineering
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's using a term like
precision breeding opens you up to
[SPEAKER_02]: criticism of being sort of disingenuous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then losing trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use words that avoid what people
might think we're really talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we do run the risk of losing trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you, trust is everything
in this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how important it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a saying that I learned somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't care how much you know until
they know how much you care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you raise a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting it in those terms,
I think anything that diminishes the trust
[SPEAKER_00]: people have in us as public servants,
which we all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all trying to get a job and be happy
in our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are working in a public
institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that trust is we've got to do
everything we can to protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are great comments and be
interesting to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really interested on the herbicide
part, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about adoption by the
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different categories of adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have consumer adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have industry adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for agribusiness, we have so much of
our economic crops that are already GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: More sugar beet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the issue is, is this going to be
affordable to use CRISPR?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what I've seen from the media is
that there's additional licensing needs
[SPEAKER_03]: for any commercial product that was
developed using CRISPR technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I consider that when you look at R or
D, this new term D, the additional D,
[SPEAKER_03]: cost effectiveness is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the barrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the best technology, but it's not
affordable compared to how cheap it is to
[SPEAKER_03]: just spray pesticide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the biggest barrier to
the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't anticipate it being more
expensive than current practices of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just have to wait and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen much that indicates the
long-term cost to farmers and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, though, it definitely
represents an opportunity in corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: can't price their products out of the
market, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to, it's called CRISPRCon,
the CRISPR conference at Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great conference because it had
people from all walks of life attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did these little surveys that you
could respond to on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think people responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a pretty good survey results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they asked the question,
what sector do you represent or what area
[SPEAKER_00]: do you represent, half were agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means all the applications in
the therapeutic world and other
[SPEAKER_00]: applications were the other half.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the big one by far was
agricultural uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it must have a lot of potential to make
money for so many people to be there from
[SPEAKER_00]: the agricultural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were company representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure maybe large scale farmers,
but not small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I worry a little bit that it's
going to be used principally for herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I respect the benefit has been
brought to the growers who use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the kind of application that
excites me because of all the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the cost issues, we'll learn more
as we go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there will be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that, has there been any work in
combining CRISPR, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-tolerance in plants with non-genetic
approaches to avoiding pests, such as push
[SPEAKER_01]: and pull or polypulture?
[SPEAKER_00]: No systematic research in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made the point that diversifying
disease control tactics is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: important to reducing the selection
pressure on the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true whether we're dealing with
a genetic trait or a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm quite confident whether we
know from fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend with fungicides, don't rely
on just on the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use other mechanisms for disease control,
other tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm saying that as an academician,
knowing that in reality, growers have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things to be concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not always do what they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our job first is to understand the
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the biology is pretty sound
that we want to at least know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be recommending alternatives and
other tactics for disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And implement it as best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody, back to your specific
question, I've not seen studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a lot of research-based
experience with everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: host plant resistance to conventional
means and all other cultural and chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: methods to know that an integrated
approach is ultimately better for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one's specifically done that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: With CRISPR technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
