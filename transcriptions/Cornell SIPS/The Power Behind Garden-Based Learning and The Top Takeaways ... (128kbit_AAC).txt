[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we'll sort of have three
portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first portion, I will focus on why
garden-based learning is so important,
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by Roger's portion where he'll
talk a little bit about the Properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension summer intern program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Megan will sort of wrap things up
with her experience from her internship
[SPEAKER_00]: this summer in Skyler County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll have some time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time I'd really like to know
who is in attendance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could please take a moment to
sort of share who you are and what your
[SPEAKER_00]: focus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could type that into the chat box,
it would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Paulina.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's interested in starting a gardening
program in Lewis County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paulina is just starting out and it's
very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very exciting stage to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else is out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen Clancy, 4-H Garden Club leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have just a few more so we can
see who is with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like we have April, a nutrition
educator in Jefferson County, farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: school coordinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like we have a big diverse group
today, some people starting out and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have been in the field for some
time, have some experience under their
[SPEAKER_00]: belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people focused on nutrition,
others on horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to know who is in attendance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk a little bit about why
gardening kind of goes hand in hand with
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cooperative Extension's mission is to
enable people to improve their lives and
[SPEAKER_00]: communities through partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our Cornell garden-based learning
mission is to provide educators with
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiring research-based gardening
resources and professional development to
[SPEAKER_00]: support engaging, empowering, and relevant
learning experiences for children,
[SPEAKER_00]: youth, adults, and communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do follow the 4-H mission in empowering
youth to reach their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working and learning in partnership with
caring adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that these missions really
go hand in hand and we really lean on each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my portion, Fiona speaking,
I would really like to lay down some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of research-based findings on why
garden-based learning is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I start, I'd like to sort of see
why do you think this work is important?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could just take a moment to share
why you believe garden-based learning is
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful in your work or your personal
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type that into the chat box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Colleen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People learn more when doing hands-on work
and are more willing to come to learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can serve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan, any time people can get out into
nature and get hands-on experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: they appreciate more how they're coming in
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecting people back to their food
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Colleen, I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen says it encourages healthy eating and
teaches where food comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all wonderful points.
[SPEAKER_00]: April said kids learn best by doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-traditional learners can grasp
concepts that they struggle with from a
[SPEAKER_00]: textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can teach anything through growing and
preparing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, our hope for this future
generation is that they respect and care
[SPEAKER_00]: for the natural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can all agree upon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that there is an
extreme disconnect with nature in this
[SPEAKER_00]: future generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children are increasingly disconnected
from nature due to overstructured
[SPEAKER_00]: schedules, loss of green space,
parental fear, and the prevalence of
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if children are losing their
connection with nature, who will care
[SPEAKER_00]: enough about wildlife and open spaces to
advocate in 10 or 20 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: If children don't have direct,
intimate experiences with nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will not care if it goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need good times in the outdoors to
realize how wonderful it is to dig in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mud, eat fresh berries, to appreciate the
hard work of bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bonding time with nature should start
early and continue through life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are experiencing is nature deficit
disorder, sort of coined by Richard Boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real, and it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually found this yesterday from the
big book of nature activities a year
[SPEAKER_00]: around guide to outdoor living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just sort of states some really
interesting figures for us to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2,500 is the number of advertising
messages a child encounters in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,738 is the number of hours the average
North American child sits in front of a
[SPEAKER_00]: glowing screen per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 183 is the number of hours a child spends
outdoors in unstructured play per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that figure would swap with the one
above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 300 is the percentage that obesity has
increased over the past 20 years for
[SPEAKER_00]: children aged 6 to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just astonishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 is also the number of corporate logos
the average child can identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only 10 is the number of native plants
and animals that the average child can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like these figures aren't just
appropriate and sort of relevant to
[SPEAKER_00]: children, but also our society as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our job is to really bring that
connection back to nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hope is our children will be
physically active and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little girl is so cute on her Barbie
bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is something much
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of American kids do not meet the
physical activity guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get 46 hours of video games or
television play a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there's less time for them to
be outside, exploring, playing,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting muddy and dirty, finding trees and
falling out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those are really important sort of
pieces to childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel that childhood is a critical
time to establish healthy lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another hope is that our children will be
nutritionally healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And food secure, which means they can
access and consume safe, affordable,
[SPEAKER_00]: culturally appropriate, nutrient-filled
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is that they're nutritionally
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factors include poor access, lack of
affordability, convenience, and habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many youth live in food deserts and have
limited access to healthful food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 18% of Americans aged 2 to 9
years are obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obesity is the number one health
concern among parents in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's half drugs and smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hope is that our children will have
the education that they need to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: empowered, to establish leadership and
confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such an important foundational time
to establish these things and to try new
[SPEAKER_00]: things and to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the actual is kind of falling into a
fit or fail school system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education has become streamlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaching has become to hit the standards
in the standardized text.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, memorization has taken over
mastery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less time for critical thinking,
creativity, and imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education has become rigid and strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can definitely echo this portion
where I felt like, you know, when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: school, it was more about jumping through
hoops and memorizing things for an A
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than really using my critical
thinking skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to fuel the future of kids,
we have to think about their entire
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that wasn't too much doom and gloom
for you, but it's really important to
[SPEAKER_00]: share that this information is critical at
this point in time in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now to the sad stuff, that gardens are
a wonderful gateway to learning and
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery for the whole child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the positive
effects of gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So children who garden are more
comfortable with the outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: have increased awareness and appreciation
for the natural world, have ownership,
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become environmental stewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They establish that important sense of
wonder and desire to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there have been studies that
show that the love of gardening is not so
[SPEAKER_00]: much about gardening, but about making
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having the freedom to make your own
decisions is incredibly powerful,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this can happen in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this John Burroughs quote,
that knowledge without love will not
[SPEAKER_00]: stick, but if love comes first,
then knowledge is sure to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to connect kids back to that love
of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children who garden also have improved
nutrition and health awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy eating can help prevent or delay
chronic conditions, and studies have shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that kids who plant it eat it,
or at least try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These healthy food choices start during
childhood and will continue through
[SPEAKER_00]: adulthood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early exposure is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have also been studies that children
who garden have higher learning
[SPEAKER_00]: achievements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have higher test scores, especially
in science and math.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also discover unique personal
strengths, and feel more I can and I
[SPEAKER_00]: belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They learn to make decisions and problem
solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gain greater self-esteem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learn interpersonal skills,
teamwork, and are more likely to build
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger relationships with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're more engaged in their
community, which I think is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening in schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases achievement scores,
increases parental involvement in
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, community involvement,
really supplements that hands-on learning
[SPEAKER_00]: that might not already be in the school
system, enhances storytelling,
[SPEAKER_00]: written expression, reading,
comprehension, and spelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just overall, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gardening might provide that type of
learning that's more hands-on and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiential, so there really is something
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the benefits of gardening aren't just
for you, they're for all ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enhances mental health, helps reduce
stress, lowers your blood pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: it leads muscle tension, and helps combat
obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when I've had a hard day at
work or somewhere else that when I get
[SPEAKER_00]: home, once I start reading, and pruning,
and caring for my plants, I feel a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quote from a child that I think
just about sums everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me proud of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening makes me feel healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can garden with family and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, in our garden,
we are growing way more than plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cultivating passion and empowerment
with the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are empowering both youth and adults to
become more, to become environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stewards and to care for their natural
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are inspiring youth and adults to make
healthier choices and lead healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well I hope that sort of gave
you a good foundation of why garden-based
[SPEAKER_00]: learning is so powerful and especially
critical at this moment of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd like to turn it over to Roger.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you, Fiona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's transfer over here to make sure I
can work these slides for you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: My perspective here is a little bit from a
corporate extension educator and how we
[SPEAKER_02]: have, this is our second year with College
of Ag and Life Sciences intern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've gone through the program now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we applied four years,
and we've won an intern for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to share, and I apologize,
my first slides are going to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit on the boring, wordy side,
but it's how we wrote for our intern,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I thought it was more important
for me to share with you the wording that
[SPEAKER_02]: we use, because I believe that's important
on how you're developing your program to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it fit, of course, for yourself,
but also how that it works for Cornell to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to provide one of these interns,
which has just been a blessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having Megan this year and Brittany last
year, if anybody sat through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brittany's presentation last year,
these are both great youth and really
[SPEAKER_02]: benefited our program beyond what I can
put on these slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me go to my first slide here,
and I apologize again, as it can be a
[SPEAKER_02]: little wordy, but maybe you can use this
when you're writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the project summary and intended
outcomes that we identified were the
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in gardening is growing
throughout New York State, and CCE
[SPEAKER_02]: continues to explore the most innovative
avenues for which to educate and inspire
[SPEAKER_02]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Demonstration gardens have proven to be an
important arena for a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: significant learning opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schuyler CCE has identified the need for a
continued, a strengthened approach to a
[SPEAKER_02]: local demonstration garden as a way to
help hundreds of local residents learn
[SPEAKER_02]: more about horticulture and area educators
learn from our success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also about sharing now and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Fiona.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the pictures, I'll just explain a
little bit on some of our different things
[SPEAKER_02]: there before I go on the reading this
slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just some much strawberries
that we have from a specialty collector
[SPEAKER_02]: that we got some strawberries donated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's our figs growing in our garden,
Chicago hardy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do some weird things, and we do a
lot of common things in the Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable trials, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to mix a lot of different things
in for the intern experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So part two of the project summary and
intended outcomes here on this slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: This garden-based learning intern will
help Schuyler CCE build upon the success
[SPEAKER_02]: of last summer's internship to further
develop, utilize, and maximize the
[SPEAKER_02]: educational benefits of the attractive,
spacious teaching garden, which lies
[SPEAKER_02]: adjacent to the CCE office complex and was
established five years ago as an outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The initial progress of our garden was a
grant, a Department of Health grant from
[SPEAKER_02]: our local community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We adopted the grant to fit the proposal
for our garden and got us established,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'll show you some slides here
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to keep this teaching
garden idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call a teaching garden ARC.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they come to visit, they call it the
learning garden because of what they get
[SPEAKER_02]: out of working with us and the community
partnerships that we've developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next, I want to spoil us and show us a
little bit of winter here because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: we're so excited about getting through
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this year this is going to be
the best time in my garden to feel that
[SPEAKER_02]: nice snow out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So continuing on the summary and intended
outcomes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summer intern will begin with an
overview of important initiatives such as
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability, diversity, and inclusion,
as well as practical guidance related to
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholder needs assessment and
successful program development processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help develop and deliver a season-long
curriculum with input from the leadership,
[SPEAKER_02]: share the results of the approach through
diverse documentation, which will include
[SPEAKER_02]: a web-based success story to be
distributed through CCE News and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell garden-based learning blog,
and potentially host a regional workshop
[SPEAKER_02]: to share what other CCE educators are
learning from the trajectory of a two-year
[SPEAKER_02]: internship experience with a growing
audience base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that part there where the
regional workshop to share with you other
[SPEAKER_02]: educators what we have learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my goal here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have plenty of time for
questions at the end because we want you
[SPEAKER_02]: to take this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel really blessed that we were
awarded an intern two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've made so many strides with our
garden due to that intern of working with
[SPEAKER_02]: audiences that in the past I was not a
full-time horticulture educator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how we could pull this off with just a
part-time, and now luckily this year that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back full-time, has worked to our
benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the student's role.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the brief description of the
student intern's role and
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So under the supervision of the
collaborators listed above, that would
[SPEAKER_02]: have been in our writing for our intern.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will participate in a preparation
session, which I think Fiona and Marcia
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with Megan to get her started and
give her a little background about
[SPEAKER_02]: garden-based learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Develop and deliver targeted educational
programs for both youth and adult
[SPEAKER_02]: audiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with Head Start is in our
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: ARC has a group home nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've come out twice a week,
would like to come out three times a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: WIC is in our building on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_02]: PINS is Youth at Risk program in our
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked with those, which was a lot
of boys that one evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 4H, at the teaching garden with
guidance and intentionally adapting
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell garden-based learning curricula.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create, enhance, and lead activities which
support the maintenance of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Observe how volunteers are developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supervise and rewarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And work with educators to implement two
volunteer trainings and gain experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monitor for pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collect data in variety trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always getting plants donated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most recent ones I can think of were
the Rutgers cranberry trials that we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did strawberry trials, variety
trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're always getting some things from
Cornell, strawberries, and so on like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, they report and share the
results regionally and statewide to
[SPEAKER_02]: educate and inspire others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Megan's part of this is going to be the
most beneficial to all of you of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: projects hopefully that we've given her
successfully through this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What qualifications were needed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in writing for the intern, we had to
identify those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the candidate will need excellent
written and oral communication skills,
[SPEAKER_02]: a genuine desire and documented interest
in working with people if necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: She or he should be attentive to detail
and should possess a general knowledge of
[SPEAKER_02]: and enthusiasm for gardening and home food
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly there, a desire to work with a
variety of audiences and an interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to perform physical work in
outdoor conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these are really crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to step back through
these one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Written and oral skills for Megan has been
her blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her ability to write articles for us
that are just exceptional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're working with garden volunteers one
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're working with an audience of maybe
youth at risk the next moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was put in various programs that
she'll talk more of on.
[SPEAKER_02]: An enthusiasm for gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think whenever I interviewed Megan,
she had worked for a CSA last year and had
[SPEAKER_02]: really showed them, even though Megan,
she'll tell you more of it, she's from an
[SPEAKER_02]: animal science background, really had a
love of plants along with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was necessary for this to work
out really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that last one there, working with a
variety of audiences and interests to
[SPEAKER_02]: perform physical work in outdoor
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year working outside in the garden,
if you didn't like a little bit of heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would not have worked at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Megan has this keen ability to be able
to work in the heat more than probably I
[SPEAKER_02]: was even able to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was extraordinary to find the youth
that really tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next, benefits and skills that we could
hopefully then provide our interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said the increased knowledge of
CCE's successful program development
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bring that to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basic gardening and local food production
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Volunteer development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Written and oral expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Intern will gain significant experience in
facilitating learning experiences,
[SPEAKER_02]: both adult and youth audiences in an
outdoor classroom environment through the
[SPEAKER_02]: co-leadership of members, classes,
and activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just try to develop a listing of
what we're giving back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a lot from an intern, probably in
any of the programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are we giving them back that they
can take with them beyond her experience
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Megan, I think I signed her
farewell card with, if you grow others,
[SPEAKER_02]: you grow yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that sort of follows with Fiona's
little tagline there that we do more than
[SPEAKER_02]: just grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The audiences that we reach really have
this need to learn gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so neat to see an intern work
with those audiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we provided that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is my welcome slide before I go
for a little bit about our garden on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's a little where I wanted to get
you to chat a little bit, is what type of
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens do you want to work with or are
already working with back home?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideas would be, do you have a teaching
garden or learning garden like ours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you more working in a community
garden, a school garden, a food plot?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of you answered a little bit
with Fiona, but just jot me down what
[SPEAKER_02]: audiences or what type of garden are you
planning back home or already have that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're utilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give you a minute here before I
move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with you to elderly in workshops,
but do not have a designated area or
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our next wish to have in our
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Colleen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie, I'm hoping to get some
demonstration gardens going in Orleans
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with two small raised beds,
one dedicated to herbs and the other to
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinator native plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Katie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep them rolling in, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move on a little bit to the
garden here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's our little welcome board.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the center of a teaching platform
that we have that we developed in our
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some benches sort of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's eight poles that are for
grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops, I got April.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping to help more local school
implement gardens and garden education in
[SPEAKER_02]: addition to local procurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, April.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this little teaching platform you'll
have a little better picture of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I said a couple years ago,
Department of Health in Schuyler County
[SPEAKER_02]: had this grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you have connections in your community
is they contacted us that nobody had
[SPEAKER_02]: applied for this grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like not heard of anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably people fighting over
grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said, Roger, we know you're new,
but we've heard you want to establish a
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a big grass plot out along the
road.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, we can help you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you write for this grant, maybe you are
pretty much the only person so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wrote for this grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was not to be taken lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was $7,500, I think, to start us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used it for infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built this teaching platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see an arbor that we put over
top of some picnic tables that were out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody would come out and sit because the
three picnic tables were in the baking
[SPEAKER_02]: sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also put a little arbor for our
entrance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see this packed gravel that's
around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all wheelchair accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the raised beds were made for
wheelchair height.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did all that with the initial,
I would say 95% of the plants were all,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote, different companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were all more than willing to
donate plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have paid for very little of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel blessed at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little nursery at home that I've
been able to donate some plants this year
[SPEAKER_02]: to help the garden along because it's
really my passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I donated some pruning plants this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just keep adding as we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is, I think, the first couple of
weeks after it was developed with the
[SPEAKER_02]: raised planters, the teaching platform in
the middle, which is sort of an old
[SPEAKER_02]: English style amphitheater, the big arbor
down at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We beefed up because we put party kiwi on
top of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And off to the right of the picture,
you can't see, would have been our
[SPEAKER_02]: wheelchair entrance off of the main
walkway coming in because we wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure this garden was developed for
all folks to be able to participate in our
[SPEAKER_02]: programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was probably now about two years
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Megan was laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, if you took this picture today,
you couldn't see through any of this
[SPEAKER_02]: because that big quince in the foreground
and those elderberries have probably
[SPEAKER_02]: doubled that size.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grapevines have taken over that whole
arbor so you feel like you're in an
[SPEAKER_02]: enclosure now that they have grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the garden has really taken off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all just volunteer because,
like I said, I was only part time as of
[SPEAKER_02]: last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So volunteers, our first three master
gardeners came out of Tompkins County last
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't even have a master gardener
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Megan knows this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught her right when the bug bit her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is some of our life master
gardeners, our garden volunteers,
[SPEAKER_02]: our nutrition staff, and Megan working on
a ladybug adoption night where we at
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Agriculture was donating,
or not donating, but had bred the nine
[SPEAKER_02]: spotted ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a adopt them and release them
in our garden night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a good diversity because it is
four different groups together working in
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something, and like I said,
I won't belabor these because Megan's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to show you, this is a lot of her
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is her ladybug adoption flyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make the interns, we teach them,
and then we make them do everything that
[SPEAKER_02]: we would do, create flyers, book rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help with the speakers, with the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: She went along, we picked them up up in
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cool experience of videotaping
the ladybug larvae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was just one of her flyers that
she created.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll talk more about that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: She did this tri-fold, which was just a
real creative all about ladybugs for kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave that out the night that folks came
in and adopted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we had as many adults as kids
adopt ladybugs that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just a cool educational
event in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, community groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about ARC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the ARC group that was out in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pins diversion is youth at risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know WIC had start programs that
are building, Office for the Aging's in
[SPEAKER_02]: our building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Social Services has a work
crew that we have worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have expressed how great it is to
learn gardening skills when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: already teaching their participants
work-related skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they really appreciate coming out to
our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a little history behind this
slide is the folks from ARC had gone to a
[SPEAKER_02]: rain barrel building workshop somewhere
else, not in our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They loved our garden so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see the water is light there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They donated their barrel to our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really incredible that they
thought about us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love working with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Megan will talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, on our previous slide,
Megan has worked on her internship blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll talk more about it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not nearly that creative of putting
videos into my blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky that I could just type a simple
letter to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these youth bring other skills that I
feel bad that I don't know better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our plant signees is our claim to fame in
our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Megan was thrown right into any new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see some of these were from my farm
donated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to get the newest plant material
that we see that is available that folks
[SPEAKER_02]: want to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are some bush cherries from
University of New Hampshire, the meter
[SPEAKER_02]: program, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we bring that in, I automatically
get the sign put on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the garden is 24-7 open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks come there to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're welcome to taste test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the deer visit as much as
people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the signees is the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Megan got to do a lot of signs,
a lot of research on the varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research in where they came from,
giving credit, designing the signs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with our signage is our nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, and Megan will probably talk
more about it, that there's 12 sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: like those brochure holders that you can
get for an open house at a home that's for
[SPEAKER_02]: sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're clear with a flip top lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have them spaced all around our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we try to put them either with timely,
planting information, or here is some of
[SPEAKER_02]: our nutrition education.
[SPEAKER_02]: One slide, you saw our nutrition educator,
Lisa, is just part time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's at camp during the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no other nutrition staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without an intern, I would not be able
to look up recipes and get them out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would not have time for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was able to get timely recipes out
there when crops were coming ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, here, kale and rhubarb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in season in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she kept up with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did some monitoring, and Megan will
talk more about how many do we put out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, how many were taken, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some record keeping also.
[SPEAKER_02]: This master gardener program is back after
a long hiatus in Schuyler County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was tasked to get a master
gardener, we want you kind of deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through ideas of like uncle soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, or we had a Batman theme for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a superhero, be a master gardener in
Schuyler County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we worked long and hard on developing,
because our master gardeners go out to
[SPEAKER_02]: local farmers markets and stuff,
on how do we find past, present,
[SPEAKER_02]: and future master gardeners to our
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we developed this on developing a
master gardener program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Megan.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll talk more about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She went out with our youth educator,
Paula.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a 4-H event, up into a summer
recreation program in Odessa, New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: and worked with youth of many ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to steal Megan's thunder,
but just wanted to share that we do
[SPEAKER_02]: outside events, get our intern out of the
garden so she's not out there sweating
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we get her out and utilize her?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard she did a wonderful turtle
project that she'll talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_02]: More.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little publisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked hard on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started this, but we keep up with this
little drawing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time we put new plants in,
they get updated on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we had some permaculture tour go
through last year, they were really
[SPEAKER_02]: impressed that a garden map existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to a lot of neat gardens,
but nobody really puts where the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are for you to find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just sort of randomly come across
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the garden map was really a great thing
for folks who visited us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, Megan, it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, everybody, and I'll take
questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys can hear me OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Roger and Fiona said, my name's Megan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the Schuyler County summer intern,
and I'm just here to talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with the program, what my big
takeaways are, and why other extension
[SPEAKER_00]: programs like what some of you guys work
for might consider wanting an intern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into this job, I really didn't know
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: My major is animal science, as Roger said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had pretty limited experience with
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I worked on a farm the previous
summer, so I was interested to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the extension office had in store for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, my job just entailed fixing up
the garden, weeding, mulching,
[SPEAKER_00]: making new signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And facilitating the many biweekly
workshops with ARC that Roger mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before, and the other community groups,
and helping out with various projects
[SPEAKER_00]: around the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it ended up being so much more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll break it down into a few
categories, because it ended up extending
[SPEAKER_00]: way beyond the initial scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I most of the entire plot, I forgot a ton
of weeds, and this is just kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: general labor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all took a lot longer than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulching it and just taking down all the
old signs, cutting the new signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of the before and after
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see the progress that
there was throughout the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted a ton of new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We acquired a big donation about halfway
through the summer that had tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and
cantaloupe plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Roger said, he donated several of his
own plants, including a goji berry bush,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of new blueberry varieties,
and three-bush cherries that I planted
[SPEAKER_00]: with members of ARC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Updated all the garden signs, made new
ones, and put together some healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: garden-relevant recipes that we put in the
garden flyer holders for pastor buys to
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, I'll slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so happy with how the garden looks
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I could continue to work on it
forever, because there's always something
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's taught me most of what it
can for the meantime, which is invaluable
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, working with community groups
each Tuesday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each Tuesday and Thursday, one to three
members of ARC would come, and their
[SPEAKER_00]: caretaker and I would facilitate a garden
activity with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it would be something
simple, like we just plant seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we water, or we weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I would prepare a more
intensive activity beforehand,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we made turtle sprouts, which is the
picture right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of like a very easy at-home
chia pet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that with the summer rec
program, and I did it with ARC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think both of them really liked the
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And benefited from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extended the opportunity to work with
WIC and Pins Diversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never heard back from WIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one evening where we worked with
Pins Diversion about a group of maybe 15
[SPEAKER_00]: boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we were just mulching and
weren't doing anything necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting, I think they really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I worked alongside
Paula, the picture to the far right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the summer rec program, where her
and I would put together hour long
[SPEAKER_00]: activities for the adjusted central
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took place each Tuesday for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the activities were all garden based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kids ranged from kindergartners to
sixth graders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the activities would get a little
harder with each age group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll discuss more of that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, working on stuff in the
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made a ton of signs all for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them was just updating older
signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I made new signs for
newer plants that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bigger hand in advertising and
marketing than I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ladybug adoption, for instance,
put together several flyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trifold poster that you see in this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as a brochure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the way, learned a ton about
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk your ear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: About ladybugs for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that anyone wants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was just an example of duties
that I ended up having that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm happy that I was able to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll talk about the takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized the power a garden can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides an affordable way to grow
fresh produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I discovered just an absolute passion
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love horticulture now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm considering pursuing that further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, the garden really
evolved over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all its signs, which mark different
areas of the garden now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully mulched and weeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Head Start garden looks absolutely
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that's a good part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, one of our master gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planted a cayenne pepper bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of those from the donation that I
received from a woman who works for ARC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger and I made these netted raised beds
so that the deer couldn't get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer were the absolute bait of our
existence this entire summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this netted bed is producing tons of
tomatoes because the deer weren't able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, everything looks a lot
more put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my pride and joy from the summer,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: A garden is so much more than just plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of thought this was cheesy
going into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A garden is helpful in so many different
ways that you wouldn't even expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it produces a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides an affordable way to grow your
own fresh produce, which is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable tool, especially for lower income
families who sometimes can't afford all
[SPEAKER_00]: the fresh produce that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the final installment of the summer
rec program, we made garden salsa where we
[SPEAKER_00]: used ingredients either found in the
garden or reactive supplements from a
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery store because we didn't have
enough for the entire group of kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting to see the kids actually
working with the tomatoes and onions and
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers that we had grown ourselves was
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can make a delicious snack
out of everything that they harvest from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a source of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working in the garden just personally has
taught me so much this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a ton about plant insect life
that I probably never would have gotten as
[SPEAKER_00]: great of detail about if I'd just taken a
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe anyone who has a garden,
even if it's just for leisure or pleasure,
[SPEAKER_00]: would inevitably learn so much over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I have Roger to thank for sharing
his expansive knowledge about plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: me, which in turn I tried my best to pass
on to either the children or the ARC
[SPEAKER_00]: members that I worked with over the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just learning the basics about soil health
and how plants grow, what bugs are pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, those are things that will
stick with you and be useful your entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just with the kids, we would of course do
garden-related activities, which were fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the turtle sprouts or replaying bug
bingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think from each of those activities,
there is a takeaway where the kids could
[SPEAKER_00]: remember something like, oh, this insect
is especially bad on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, if they're just out in
nature and they see that bug, I hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll remember the things that we taught
them, even if it's totally small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Fiona was saying earlier,
gardening is incredibly therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told several times that members
of ARC who came to the garden frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: for the workshops that I did with them
really benefited from the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could even see it week to week.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of the members who continually came
back throughout the summer would come and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be so excited to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come out of the car and be like,
what are we doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you got planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really exciting to see that weekly
progression, that they were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: thrilled to keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the summer, some of the
members were so excited that when I told
[SPEAKER_00]: them that I was leaving, they actually got
really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sad that I can't continue working with
them just because it was such a beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I would just use the garden as
an escape spout a lot of my mind or wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Fiona said, just an hour or so out in
the garden, I would feel infinitely
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as self-fulfillment, gardening is
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun and it's relaxing, but it's
definitely work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll weed and you'll mulch and you'll
sweat and you'll get incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: discouraged when things that you plant die
or when a deer eats something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just put in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gratification that comes with seeing
the first tomato that you plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: ripened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the sprouts coming out that you
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbeatable and it's really
fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to point out this progress too,
especially the ARC members I worked with,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we planted a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each week they came back, I would take
them back to where we planted the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, look, these are the seeds you
planted and now they're sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming up and one day they'll be
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that they can have even just that
small amount of ownership over the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and its success is a great accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, gardens can be, and at least in
my experience this summer, the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: platform for forming connections,
both with nature and other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something so essential with
connecting with plants and the earth that
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people lose nowadays,
like Fiona was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cultivate an appreciation for the
earth and how we as people work with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and communicate with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also truly believe that everyone can
enjoy a garden, even if they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who particularly likes being
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can find something about it that
they enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of people I've met and befriended
in the garden is truly uncountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just people who walked by the garden or
walked through it, I would talk to them
[SPEAKER_00]: for 10, 15 minutes and just see that they
really appreciated the beauty of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether my role was as a facilitator or
teacher, like with Ark or the kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just as a helping hand, like with my
coworkers and the master gardeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can honestly say I won't forget the
people I've connected with this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that they think of the garden as
fondly as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To close up, I know we're running out of
time here, but why have an intern?
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of you people listening,
if you're considering having an intern or
[SPEAKER_00]: applying for an intern in the future,
I'd like to just share my own experience
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can know that it really can
make a difference, both to the intern and
[SPEAKER_00]: to your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: An intern can be a new perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky in that Roger gave me a lot of
freedom to attend to the garden and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: activities with Ark as I saw fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, a lot of new ideas evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I created new sites in the garden and
times dividing it into easy-to-follow
[SPEAKER_00]: sections like the butterfly garden,
raspberry patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had minimal prior experience with
gardening and working with community
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, so I learned as I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, I was able to look at
everything from a fresh point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, an intern can be a helping hand in
tons of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said earlier, I ended up having a lot
more duties than I had been helping out
[SPEAKER_00]: with things that I didn't expect,
which was great because I helped out
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger, Kathy, Paula, the people I work
with, all on a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: projects while still routinely working in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, got so much accomplished and
really gained tons of new skills in
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas that I didn't expect over
the course of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, having an intern, you can really
change the student's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really indecisive about what I
wanted coming into this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, why I'm an animal science major
and an internship pretty unrelated to
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, but working with the incredible
people in the extension office and
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting with so many community members,
I began to get a better idea of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm still unsure about a lot,
but just this summer has convinced me to
[SPEAKER_00]: at least pursue a minor in horticulture
because I wouldn't trade the experiences I
[SPEAKER_00]: had for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the summer was hard, I don't regret
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried a single part of it, and I loved
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everyone I worked with,
to Roger, Fiona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now we're going to ask some
questions, try to engage you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Roger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to just chime in.
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't highlight that one picture,
but those ladybug cupcakes were amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the highlight of ladybug
adoption night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our nutrition staff, kudos to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for listening so
patiently for the last few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is your time to ask any questions that
are on your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We blocked off the next half hour or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of time to have a lively
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either type your question into the
chat box, or I believe you can raise your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, and I can unmute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Katie,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can answer that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you protect your signs from the
elements out in the garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our color isn't spaced yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pictures of the apples and so on did
not last too long, but the black ink on a
[SPEAKER_02]: cardstock has lasted us pretty much for a
year until we replaced them again,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the color fades really fast,
so we have not been able to solve that one
[SPEAKER_02]: there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody ever has a good color-fast
printer ink or something, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: work on that, but the black on the
cardstock has lasted fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like you have another question from
Paulina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you get most of your funding
from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of as stated in the presentation,
all the plants were donated, so that is
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% or 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little pot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think $300 each year was set aside from
proper extension for the garden in our
[SPEAKER_02]: budget, so we purchased tools and
knickknacks and things like that with that
[SPEAKER_02]: $300.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, everything that was built
came from the initial department of health
[SPEAKER_02]: grant was all the major construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really never did any more construction
after that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we had, but we never finished our
one walkway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you plan on only having college interns
or do you plan on using high school
[SPEAKER_00]: interns?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to have additional interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we were really blessed to get two
years through the CALS program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably be lucky to ever get a third year
because I heard two years was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always looking for interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard sometimes because we are out,
especially for Megan.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had to drive out each day from Ithaca
where she lived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brittany last year lived in Watkins
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really close, so maybe a high
school one or a high school program that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually has some youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could also take a look at Elmira
College and some local colleges where some
[SPEAKER_02]: youth might have to do a little bit of
intern before they graduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to do a lot of exploring over
this winter of some other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: A follow-up from Colleen said if funding
or interns are not available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, how will the garden be sustained
or kept alive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Colleen's question there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interns are going to be a question mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we have three Master Gardeners
that completed the program up at Tompkins
[SPEAKER_02]: with Pat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plan on sending a couple more folks
that are interested in the Master Gardener
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been really reliable in helping
with our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Debbie, who is one of our Master
Gardeners, actually has to take a bus
[SPEAKER_02]: because she cannot drive twice a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: She comes almost all year long.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is really dedicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have passionate people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a lot of our volunteers that aren't
Master Gardeners just love the community
[SPEAKER_02]: engagement in the garden because it is
very focal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to just come out there and just
help out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put a call out for help like the
weeds are getting a little big,
[SPEAKER_02]: how can we get a weeding party together?
[SPEAKER_02]: They show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just incredible the interest level we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that interns are going to
be, like I said before, two years was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty lucky, but maybe we'll develop
other ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am also full-time now, so I'll be able
to help out, especially when Megan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be doing the ARC tour this week and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's made a good base for us to keep it
running for the rest of the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have the winter to regroup and go
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another sign question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were the signs laminated in-house or sent
out to a printing company?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually a project for Megan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, she blew up one of our
laminators this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the amount of laminating we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We burned one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of laminating on the signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: She did everything from developing some
brand new ones, to printing out the old
[SPEAKER_02]: ones, to laminating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had this whole little system where
we have a soil water department put in
[SPEAKER_02]: fencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They split a bunch of pressure-treated
poles when they're pounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They donate those to us and we cut them
into little angled sign holders that sit
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have done a close-up one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put a little dab of silicone behind
where the staple is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sign goes on and then the staple goes
through and then a dab of silicone on the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water doesn't ruin our signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we are really pretty good,
except for color, making one full season
[SPEAKER_02]: before we have to replace them back out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just consider that part of our budget
for the garden, putting the signs out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, because that is our silent
salesperson if we were selling something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of those projects where we see
folks in the garden when I'm leaving at
[SPEAKER_02]: night, sometimes at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a family out there taking
some fresh raspberries and reading the
[SPEAKER_02]: signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same in the morning, if there's joggers,
they'll stop and look at, what's that
[SPEAKER_02]: quince tree?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had Megan's farewell meal out in
the garden yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we went to come in, I had three
questions in a row of folks who stopped
[SPEAKER_02]: because somebody was in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked a gardening-related question
that they may not have come in our
[SPEAKER_02]: building for because you come through
security.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little spooky to some folks to
have to come through sheriffs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're out in the garden,
like Megan said, you get approached by
[SPEAKER_02]: tons of community members asking what this
is, how do I solve this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have trees dying from the drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I water them properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that connection when you're out there
that's really good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for both Roger and
Megan, but also for everyone else that's
[SPEAKER_00]: attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone have a top garden based
learning resource or a top activity that
[SPEAKER_00]: they find works really well?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, feel free to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it a few times, and this is
the turtle sprout activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an activity I pulled from Cornell's
garden based learning website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant for ages like kindergarten to
maybe fifth grade or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all the essentials of gardening
packed into one, and it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids get to draw their own turtle,
and then you fill just the stocking with
[SPEAKER_00]: some grass seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With ARC, I believe we did dill instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put some sort of seed in the
bottom that's small enough where it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come up through the panty hose,
and then soil on top and tie it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just water it every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it starts growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see the
kids that I did this activity with a
[SPEAKER_00]: second time, like a week later,
because I would have loved to ask them if
[SPEAKER_00]: they catch up with it if it actually
started sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just a fun activity,
really affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it in mass amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 30 kids, plus I did several more
the next day with ARC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very cheap and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It taught them a decent amount about
gardening in a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll chime in with another one along those
same lines of being very affordable and
[SPEAKER_00]: very easy and not too material intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one, you can call them seed bombs
or seed balls or anything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pretty much just take a large chunk of
clay and each person gets a small piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flatten it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of the clay patty,
you put some soil and some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be wildflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be really any type of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that with basil before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you smash it all into a ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids love the tactile, fun,
getting dirty part of it, but they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: taking seeds home with them to plant then
or plant at a later date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another really easy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can set up if you didn't know you
had some group coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, we can always do seed balls
because they're really easy to set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we scroll down, we might have somebody
after Katie, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked about gravel for our
pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think landscape fabric instead?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel gravel was better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our walkways have fabric underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is part of the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a little bit chunkier stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a really fine, I think they called it
stone dust from our landscaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that packs, it is hard as cement,
which is a little loose on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheelchairs, strollers, even walkers go
through it really well because of how it
[SPEAKER_02]: packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is all three levels in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fabric is below to keep weeds from
coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only get a little transitional weeds at
the edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They try to come in, but they pull really
easy out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a good two inches thick of
that stone dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was put in from our landscaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if I could ever afford to do
the other half of the garden so there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: exit back out on the other end,
we would continue with that stone dust
[SPEAKER_02]: because it has worked so well for
wheelchairs on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulina's question, do you have printable
worksheets for that activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that is directed towards
the turtle's crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the sea balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the turtle's crap are on the
Cornell Garden Based Learning website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to lessons and activities,
they should be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are downloadable PDFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're on there, you'll find a whole
lot of other great activities too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we will be posting the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole webinar has been recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, I remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I am able to download, post the
webinar, and transfer it to a different
[SPEAKER_00]: format, I will then upload it to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions and are able to
find it in the next few days, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: always email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever, some of you probably have the
old Project WET curriculum.
[SPEAKER_02]: In there is the water cycle game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little bit more because I had to
build it and laminate the dice that you
[SPEAKER_02]: roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little beads that the kids get improve
the water cycle game.
[SPEAKER_02]: They share that bracelet at the end with
their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can see they got five of the dark
blue in a row because they were stuck in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the water droplet travels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, if it's coming out of an animal
as urine, there's only one time that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, you maybe get stuck in the
cloud or in the ocean multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may get seven beads in a row because
you don't leave that station.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really grasp the understanding of
where that water droplet is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense that it wouldn't be there
very long versus, yeah, I'd be stuck in
[SPEAKER_02]: the water droplet in the ocean for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all talk up their beads to each other
at the end and ask, what color is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never green.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never in a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: My little water droplet never made it
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool the way they share it
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really win for me that they
understand it enough to share with their
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and talk about where they were in
that cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little more prep work because you've got
to buy the beads and make these little
[SPEAKER_02]: dice, but it is a fun water cycle game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other questions about the
general garden-based learning theory or
[SPEAKER_00]: about the internship or anything else that
we can help you out with today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everyone for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Roger and Meg for their
awesome presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do want to stick in a quick plug
for a webinar that Cornell Garden-Based
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning will be hosting on September 7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some really exciting upcoming
projects this following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to give you a teaser about them
and give you some more information about
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please get that on your calendar,
September 7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is 930 to 1030 in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking forward to seeing you
all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any other questions,
feel free to ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, thanks to everybody and have a
wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
