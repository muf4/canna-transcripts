[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the introduction, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also grew up in Ithaca and was a
research assistant at Cornell back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer of 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a real pleasure to be back
here again, even if just over Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: After my time at Cornell, I went off to
grad school at the University of Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: as Chris said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was there, I studied range
expansion dynamics of plants in response
[SPEAKER_01]: to climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, I focused on biotic
interactions between range-expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and herbivores and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The core of my work was a series of
transplant experiments across a
[SPEAKER_01]: latitudinal gradient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these experiments, I quantified how
biotic and abiotic processes affected
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth and survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data from these field experiments gave me
a chance to study how these processes
[SPEAKER_01]: varied across spatial scales ranging from
meters to height.
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of kilometers, and to quantify
how these processes affected plant
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also investigated the effects of various
global change drivers on plant populations
[SPEAKER_01]: using meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, this work was motivated by the
desire to both understand how climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change will affect these forests and the
hope that this knowledge would inform
[SPEAKER_01]: management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my research themes, creating
models of ecological processes for
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plants, scaling to populations
and landscapes, and using this information
[SPEAKER_01]: to inform management.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's hard to manage processes
that are occurring on time scales of
[SPEAKER_01]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided I wanted to work on a plant
ecology topic that had more immediate
[SPEAKER_01]: relevance to people's lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after my PhD, I began to apply these
same research themes to a new topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my talk today, I'm going to start by
covering the current state of affairs in
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen, and then move on to
describe the spatio-temporal models of
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen that I've created by
quantifying pollen production,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant location, and flowering phenology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the talk, I'm going to show you
how I've applied these same methods to
[SPEAKER_01]: urban trees and ragweed plants in Detroit,
to juniper trees in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to tell you a little
bit about my future research plans of
[SPEAKER_01]: applying similar methods to trees at
continental scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all gymnosperms and at least 10% of
angiosperms are wind-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: In temperate regions like Ithaca,
this includes most trees and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: important crops, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: For these plants, understanding airborne
pollen is critical for understanding gene
[SPEAKER_01]: flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is relevant to research that's
being done now at CIPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, pollination is required for
hemp crops that are being grown for grain,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas airborne pollen can interfere with
hemp being grown for CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another relevant agricultural issue is the
spread of herbicide resistance genes
[SPEAKER_01]: across landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, understanding airborne pollen
is important for paleoecologists that
[SPEAKER_01]: reconstruct plant communities using pollen
grains in sediment cores or fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen also directly affects human health
by triggering allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an understanding of airborne pollen is
important in all of these examples and to
[SPEAKER_01]: many examples that I haven't listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the next few days, I'm looking
forward to talking with many of you about
[SPEAKER_01]: this topic and how my research themes
might apply to your study systems,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, for most of today,
I'm going to focus on airborne pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: through the lens of allergies and human
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen allergies are becoming increasingly
common around the world, and rising carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide concentrations also cause plants
to produce more pollen and pollen that is
[SPEAKER_01]: more allergenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though pollen allergies are
sometimes dismissed as just a nuisance,
[SPEAKER_01]: they make life miserable for millions of
Americans and people around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have big societal consequences,
including millions of lost school and work
[SPEAKER_01]: days every year and can also trigger
potentially fatal asthma attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what we know about airborne pollen
comes from pollen monitoring stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are about 80 of these stations in
the United States which are run through
[SPEAKER_01]: the National Allergy Bureau network,
and each of these stations takes
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated daily measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a map of these monitoring stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we zoom into the northeast,
you can see that the nearest station to
[SPEAKER_01]: Ithaca is in Rochester, about 75 miles
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current paradigm in this field is to
just use data from the nearest monitoring
[SPEAKER_01]: station.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it is standard practice to
assume that pollen concentrations in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ithaca are the same as they are on one
roof in Rochester.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, when you see pollen
concentrations reported in the media,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're usually getting is yesterday's
measurements likely from tens of miles
[SPEAKER_01]: away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, while the forecasting methods that
are used by companies are usually
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary, one of the poorly kept
secrets is that a lot of these forecasts
[SPEAKER_01]: from leading websites are actually based
off of allergy medication sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not always the best proxy for
airborne pollen concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in the best case, these
predictions of airborne pollen generally
[SPEAKER_01]: assume that pollen is homogenous within
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprisingly, there's very little data on
how pollen concentrations vary within
[SPEAKER_01]: regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One potential explanation for why we don't
know more is that most plant ecologists
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know much about allergies,
and most allergists don't know much about
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this has kind of fallen into
gaps between fields a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's another really big reason
why we don't know more, and that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: methods that are used for sampling pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, two types of samplers have
been used, the rotorock and the Burkhardt
[SPEAKER_01]: sampler.
[SPEAKER_01]: These samplers were designed about 70
years ago and haven't changed much since
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bulky, they need to be plugged
into AC power, and they also aren't cheap,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes it difficult to conduct these
large simultaneous measurement campaigns
[SPEAKER_01]: that we need to figure out how pollen
varies over relatively small spatial
[SPEAKER_01]: scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my contributions here was making an
updated design of one of these pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: sampler types myself, and I was lucky
enough to get some help from a few
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering grad students on this,
and I ended up soldering together a fleet
[SPEAKER_01]: of these samplers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The designs for them are currently in prep
for submission to an open-source hardware
[SPEAKER_01]: journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these samplers, I was able to
empirically test whether this large
[SPEAKER_01]: assumption of pollen being homogenous
within regions within a region was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I'm going to show you some results
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a map of Detroit, the study area
for my first postdoc, and this map shows
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously collected oak pollen
measurements across Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color of each of these circles
indicates airborne pollen on a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just one day as an example,
and I'd like to note that the color scale
[SPEAKER_01]: here is logarithmic, and the take-home
message from this is that pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations do vary dramatically over
relatively short distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also shows why using a single station
as a proxy for an entire region doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work all that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, measurements from that pollen
station, shown in the upper right-hand
[SPEAKER_01]: corner of this map, they only explain
about 6% of the variation in oak pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: across the area, across the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should also point out that other
taxa had similar results in concentrations
[SPEAKER_01]: on a particular day, often varied by two
or three orders of magnitude across the
[SPEAKER_01]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, this means that we've been making
bad assumptions about exposure to airborne
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen because we haven't been thinking
about it spatially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time for a paradigm shift in
our understanding of airborne pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my talk today, I'm going to show you
the benefits of transitioning from a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenological monitoring network to a
spatial modeling approach that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: the underlying ecological and biological
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this has the potential to
revolutionize our understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: allergenic pollen exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the next section of my talk,
I'm going to walk you through my approach
[SPEAKER_01]: to modeling airborne pollen, which
requires answering these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, how much pollen does a single plant
produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, where are the plants that are
releasing pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And third, when are these plants flowering
and releasing pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, each of these are basic research
questions on their own, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of them leads to applied
solutions to real-world problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, even though this is research
on plants, the health implications here
[SPEAKER_01]: are strong enough that it was competitive
for NIH funding, which supported my
[SPEAKER_01]: postdoc at U of M.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal was to be able to estimate an
individual tree's pollen production as a
[SPEAKER_01]: function of its size, but no such
equations had been developed for North
[SPEAKER_01]: American tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the equations that had been developed
for trees elsewhere generally used pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: coarse methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set about creating equations for several
tree species, but for most of my talk
[SPEAKER_01]: today, I'm going to show you examples from
oak trees because they are common and
[SPEAKER_01]: produce lots of allergenic pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I'd also like to
acknowledge Victoria Bankowski,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was an undergraduate student who
worked with me for two years on a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of projects, including this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example of how I estimated
pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I selected trees of a range of
sizes, and then I borrowed a trick from my
[SPEAKER_01]: days of assessing understory light
availability and took hemispherical photos
[SPEAKER_01]: of each tree's canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These photos made it easy for me to
systematically and quantitatively estimate
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of flower clusters per tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then took branch samples and counted the
number of catkins per cluster,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then counted the number of anthers per
catkin, and finally counted the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen grains per anther.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then multiplied all of these together to
estimate a tree's pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, how well can we
predict pollen production based on a
[SPEAKER_01]: tree's size?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the x-axis here is a tree's canopy
area, and on the y-axis is the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen grains produced in millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a look at the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dots here are individual trees,
and the lines are regressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mean is in blue, and the variation,
which is based on bootstrapping,
[SPEAKER_01]: is in gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for red oak trees, larger trees
produced more pollen, and they did so in a
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This held true for the other species in
the study, too, and it turns out that tree
[SPEAKER_01]: size is a very good predictor of pollen
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I want to take a moment
to focus in on something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pollen production in the millions,
but it's kind of hard to get a good gut
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of what 100 million pollen grains
means, so I want to put those numbers in
[SPEAKER_01]: some context.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest white mulberry tree that I
measured had about 125 million anthers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an animation of a single white
mulberry anther releasing pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That single anther has about 50,000 pollen
grains in it, but it only takes as few as
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 pollen grains per cubic meter of air
for the most sensitized people to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: allergic reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine being allergic to white
mulberry and having hundreds of these
[SPEAKER_01]: trees in your city.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step in developing a model of
airborne pollen was to figure out where
[SPEAKER_01]: each of these trees were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my study area was the city of
Detroit, which is big, and at 360 square
[SPEAKER_01]: kilometers, there's no way to measure all
of these trees by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, we're living at a time when vast
amounts of new remote sensing data are
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming available as are processing
techniques to manage it, and these can be
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to tasks like tree identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these new data sources is a company
called Nearmap, which takes
[SPEAKER_01]: high-resolution aerial images of most
urban areas in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: a few times a year, and this dataset had
never been used for tree identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I combined it, the multi-temporal aerial
images from Nearmap with a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: datasets, including LIDAR and a street
tree database, and used that to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: trees in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you a brief overview of
how I did this analysis, but if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about the details, I'd be happy
to discuss it more in the
[SPEAKER_01]: question-and-answer session after the
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so here's an aerial image of one
spot in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see trees, houses, a golf course,
and now let's overlay that LIDAR data on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: LIDAR provides information about the
three-dimensional structure of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: and here the whiter colors, the white,
corresponds to taller objects.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this information about the height of
each object, we can then use segmentation
[SPEAKER_01]: algorithms to segment these into canopies
of individual trees or at least large
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of a tree, and that's shown by
these yellow polygons here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then extracted various indices from the
aerial imagery and the LIDAR and used that
[SPEAKER_01]: to classify the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color of each polygon here corresponds
to the predicted taxon of that tree canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: polygon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This worked out great for setting several
taxa, but others I couldn't tease apart as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even with these limitations,
these predictions of individual tree
[SPEAKER_01]: identity are incredibly useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to note that we're on the
cusp of tree identification with remote
[SPEAKER_01]: sensing being operational, and over the
next few years, these datasets are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to become more and more widespread and
accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'd like to draw your attention to
these green polygons, which are oak trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: and here's where it gets really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know the area of each of these
tree canopy polygons, we can plug in those
[SPEAKER_01]: alimetric equations of pollen production
to predict how much pollen each of these
[SPEAKER_01]: trees is going to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's estimated pollen production for
each oak tree in this frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because this is done with remote
sensing data though, we can scale this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's zoom out to the whole
neighborhood here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the University District in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an area with a lot of oak trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's zoom out even more to the whole
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: The square on this slide is where the
previous slide left off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are, a map of oak pollen
production for Detroit based on pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: production by individual trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really cool, and you can just see
the differences in neighborhoods between
[SPEAKER_01]: oak pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next big question is whether
nearby pollen production predicts airborne
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all, people have long assumed that
because pollen can blow long distances
[SPEAKER_01]: that it usually does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: The x-axis of this figure is predicted
pollen production around a sampling site,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the y-axis is the average
concentration of airborne pollen during
[SPEAKER_01]: the springtime based on repeated sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer the question of whether
there's more airborne pollen near source
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a strong relationship
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an exciting finding because it
provides very strong evidence that local
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are driving airborne pollen
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, this shows that if you
live in a neighborhood with more oak
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, you're likely going to be exposed
to much more oak pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also suggest that if you're allergic
to oak trees, you shouldn't be planting
[SPEAKER_01]: one in your front yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is common sense, but we haven't
had a scientific basis to justify that
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this finding is really relevant for
large landowners like municipal
[SPEAKER_01]: governments and points to the possibility
of being able to intentionally create
[SPEAKER_01]: lower allergen landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my major conclusion here is that we
should be including allergenic pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: production as one criterion in our tree
selection decisions because the choices
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're making about what trees we
plant affects pollen exposure for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that live nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one concern is that this finding
could be interpreted as an argument for
[SPEAKER_01]: having fewer trees in cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two responses to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, one of the best management options
is to just plant different trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, we could plant cultivars
that produce less pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other response that I have is that
allergenic pollen, it's just one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: many ways in which we're interacting with
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in almost all circumstances,
the ecosystem services provided by trees
[SPEAKER_01]: will dramatically outweigh the ecosystem
disservices of allergenic pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to point out that the same
framework that I'm using, understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: processes for individual plants,
scaling them up, and using that
[SPEAKER_01]: information to inform management,
we can also apply this to some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem services that these trees are
providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take you on a brief detour
and show you shade as an example of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take this tree here in Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then look at it from above outlined in
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: To understand the shade provided by this
tree, we can create a mechanistic model
[SPEAKER_01]: that takes into account the height of that
tree and the angle of the sun on any
[SPEAKER_01]: particular day of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an animation of modeled shade
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the trajectory of the sun
across the sky and see how these trees
[SPEAKER_01]: shade different buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, since this is done with remote
sensing data, it gives us a way to scale
[SPEAKER_01]: from individual plants to landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, having just lived
through my first Austin summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a deep appreciation for the shade
these trees provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's get back to pollen in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've now covered plant location and
pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the other process that
we need to predict pollen emissions,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the timing of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that temperature determines
flowering time, and we also know that
[SPEAKER_01]: urban heat islands and temperature
gradients in cities are common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I therefore hypothesize that there would
also be differences in flowering time
[SPEAKER_01]: within Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: To assess the relationships between
temperature, flowering time, and airborne
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen, I conducted a field study in
Detroit where I measured flowering time
[SPEAKER_01]: for a bunch of trees in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I measured the flowering phenology of
over 100 trees and nine different
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those neighborhoods are shown with the
hollow symbols on this map here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then compared flowering time with
temperature during the early spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically land surface temperature,
which comes from, which I, and to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: land surface temperature, I use data from
the MODIS sensor on the Terra and Aqua
[SPEAKER_01]: satellites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the results for whether
temperature explains flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature is on the x-axis, and the
timing of flowering is on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of these small symbols is a single
tree, and the large symbols are site
[SPEAKER_01]: averages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, the association is
very strong, and warmer places flower
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can then combine our knowledge of this
relationship with remote sensing-based
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements of temperature to predict the
timing of flowering across the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: metro area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next, I'm going to show you an
animation of predicted flowering dates for
[SPEAKER_01]: oak trees in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of these frames is a day,
and flowering is indicated by the yellower
[SPEAKER_01]: colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that wave of flowering
moving from the south to cooler areas in
[SPEAKER_01]: the north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then by the middle of May, you can see
trees have basically finished flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've now shown you data on the various
processes that determine airborne pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations, including how much pollen
is released, where pollen is released
[SPEAKER_01]: from, and when that pollen is released.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can then combine all of these different
processes to predict pollen release over
[SPEAKER_01]: both time and space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next, I'm going to show you an
animation that puts all of this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is predicted pollen release for
oak trees in Detroit in the spring of
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you can see the interplay of both
those spatial features of where oak trees
[SPEAKER_01]: are and how much pollen they're releasing,
as well as the temporal dynamics caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature differences across the city of
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the big question, though,
is whether this model predicts airborne
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen at particular times and places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to say that when I
compared this model of pollen release with
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen from that data set that I
collected with the pollen samplers,
[SPEAKER_01]: this model explained almost half of the
variation in airborne pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations for oak trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to emphasize that this is about
nine times better than simply using pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements from the nearest pollen
monitoring station as a proxy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been the standard practice in
this field, at least as it applies to
[SPEAKER_01]: allergies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allergists have long said that pollen is
everywhere and you can't avoid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these results say otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are real pollen hotspots and they
are also predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine having this extra resolution
and accuracy in your pollen forecast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it offers all sorts of
possibilities, including ways for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to either avoid pollen hotspots or to take
their medication ahead of time so it
[SPEAKER_01]: reaches full efficacy before they're
exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: These types of improvements could really
improve quality of life for many people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for vulnerable people, including those
with asthma or chronic obstructive
[SPEAKER_01]: pulmonary disorder, this is a really big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be wondering about the effect of
wind and atmospheric dispersion on
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can say it's very big and it should
be included here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These models of pollen release will pair
nicely with atmospheric dispersion
[SPEAKER_01]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've collected some of the data needed
to calibrate these models, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: created them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also expect that the same framework
could also be applied to fungal spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would have applications,
not just in allergy, but also in
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I've shown you how my framework
works for trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my next example, I'm going to turn
towards ragweed, which is an early
[SPEAKER_01]: successional species.
[SPEAKER_01]: That releases vast amounts of allergenic
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to begin, I'd like to acknowledge
Tiffany Carey, who was a mentee of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: starting in 2010 when we first started a
pollen project together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really proud of the contributions
that Tiffany made to this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's now back in Detroit again,
working with the National Wildlife
[SPEAKER_01]: Federation on environmental and social
issues there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that Tiffany and I
noticed pretty early on was that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: far more ragweed in vacant lots in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has demolished about 20,000
vacant structures since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a little chrono sequence of
what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a building that is slated for
demolition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the exposed soil the next
spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the fall, you can see little bits of
green in the lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is exactly the habitat where
ragweed thrives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quantified this habitat across the city
of Detroit using remote sensing data and
[SPEAKER_01]: linked it with field surveys in order to
create a map of pollen production across
[SPEAKER_01]: the city of Detroit, which I'm showing to
you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This approach worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also think that similar methods
could be used for understanding weed
[SPEAKER_01]: populations across agricultural
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our findings was that some
neighborhoods had lots and lots of ragweed
[SPEAKER_01]: and others had almost none.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighborhoods that have many vacant
lots and a lot of ragweed tend to be
[SPEAKER_01]: poorer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, you can just see the spatial
correlation between ragweed pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: production and the percent of Detroiters
living in poverty, which is shown in this
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom map.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people living in poorer neighborhoods
also tend to have less access to health
[SPEAKER_01]: care and higher allergy and asthma rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is an example where
ragweed pollen exposure is actually an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental justice issue, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to take a moment to talk about
this statistic that I've just put on the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen, that Black people in Detroit are
twice as likely to be hospitalized for
[SPEAKER_01]: asthma as white people in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this isn't the type of statistic that
we usually mention in plant ecology talks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's relevant here because
interactions with plants could be making a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount of contribution to this
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, in this particular case,
there are some simple management
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations for vacant lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, it turns out that if
you either mow regularly, the ragweed goes
[SPEAKER_01]: away, or if you leave the lot on its own,
succession happens and ragweed is
[SPEAKER_01]: outcompeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've now shown you examples of how I've
quantified the ecological processes
[SPEAKER_01]: relating to pollen release and how I've
scaled this up to the municipal level for
[SPEAKER_01]: both oak trees and ragweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are just predictions in a single
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next thing to do is to work to
scale this up to even larger areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what I'm doing as a postdoc at
the University of Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: My research here is on cedar fever,
which is actually allergies caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: juniper pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, this is one of the most important
allergenic pollen producing plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: US, in part because of how much pollen it
releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a branch of a juniper tree
releasing pollen in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really big juniper tree of this species
can release as many as half a trillion
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen grains each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anecdotally, we know that cedar fever has
big effects on respiratory health in
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas, but that's never been quantified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm working on an
epidemiological analysis to compare
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen concentrations with
emergency department visits for asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the preliminary results from this
study are showing that cedar fever is
[SPEAKER_01]: conservatively associated with about 5,000
extra emergency department visits each
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since only the most extreme cases result
in ED visits, the true effects of cedar
[SPEAKER_01]: fever on quality of life for Texans is
astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I'm going about working on this
problem is to create similar models to
[SPEAKER_01]: what I did in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do so, I'm taking the same
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm figuring out how much pollen
individual trees produce, figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: where these trees are and when they
release pollen, and then using dispersion
[SPEAKER_01]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of this is to create
near-term forecasts and alerts for cedar
[SPEAKER_01]: fever sufferers in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to make this work at the state level,
I've had to do something different because
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't drive all around the state to
collect these measurements myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started a citizen science project
called Pollen Trackers through a
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration with the National Phenology
Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Volunteers on this project are helping to
collect those measurements of pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: released by June approach across Texas,
and we are just about to go into our
[SPEAKER_01]: second field season next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of my work is to develop
process-based models of airborne pollen at
[SPEAKER_01]: the continental scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Models like this would fill gaps in our
understanding of both gene flow and of how
[SPEAKER_01]: much pollen people are exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forecasts from this model would also be
really useful for people to both reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: their own exposure and to better manage
their medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of potential benefits
for having continental scale models of
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen, and it would also help us
to do things like understand the role of
[SPEAKER_01]: local pollen production versus long
distance dispersal of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would have applications, not just in
the allergy world, but it would also be
[SPEAKER_01]: really important for understanding gene
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, creating a continental scale
model is an ambitious goal, and so I've
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to break this up into several
distinct research projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first of these projects is
understanding where trees are and how much
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big task, but I think that it's
feasible to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I propose approaching it is by
combining data on what trees are where
[SPEAKER_01]: from the forest inventory and analysis
data set, which now, in addition to
[SPEAKER_01]: including forested plots, it also includes
data on urban trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This data set of tree locations and
abundance could be combined with remote
[SPEAKER_01]: sensing data, and in particular,
it could be combined with imagery from
[SPEAKER_01]: satellites like Landsat, as well as with
WIDAR from JEDI,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is another potentially very useful
resource for this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: These estimates of tree abundance could
then be combined with alimetric equations
[SPEAKER_01]: of pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some ideas about how we could do a
better job of making alimetric equations
[SPEAKER_01]: faster and more efficiently, and I think a
great place to parameterize some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: equations would be Arnott Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's also going to be important
here to include some of the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: plant ecology processes that are also
going to affect pollen production,
[SPEAKER_01]: so things like competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of applications for
these data products, both for pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also for understanding other ecosystem
services and disservices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including things like, say, the spread of
tree pests and pathogens across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that NASA would be a good
potential funding source for this project,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically through the Earth Science
Research Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to create continental scale
models of pollen, we also need to create
[SPEAKER_01]: continental scale models of flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: To create this, I propose doing a few
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, expanding my current citizen
science project with the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenology Network, and they're excited
about this possibility, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could also get observations of
flowering time from NEON.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another possibility is to use some new
pollen monitoring devices that I have been
[SPEAKER_01]: piloting here in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: These devices, I pull one out,
so these devices allow you, it basically
[SPEAKER_01]: is a little Arduino-controlled motor,
which can be timed to spin a acrylic plate
[SPEAKER_01]: at a certain rate, and these can be placed
underneath trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can change the timing of this,
so you can get very fine resolution
[SPEAKER_01]: estimates of pollen release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm piloting the idea of
sending these devices out to people in my
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen trackers program so that they can
both corroborate the data that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting, because let's be real,
citizen science is messy, but more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly than that, they could augment
it by having a finer temporal
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of when pollen is released.
[SPEAKER_01]: These observations of flowering time could
then be combined with granular climate
[SPEAKER_01]: data, and the combination of these things
could be used to create flowering models.
[SPEAKER_01]: These could then be, these flowering
models could potentially use close to
[SPEAKER_01]: real-time data sources in order to create
near-term forecasts of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better and more accessible models of
flowering time would be useful for many
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes besides allergies, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: One example is the risk of frost damage to
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked a little bit on this project in
graduate school, and one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that is clear in the literature is that
climate change is increasing the risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: frost damage to flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, in Ithaca this year, there was
snow on the ground on May 9th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a better sense of when things are
flowering could be really useful for
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and responding to frost
risk, and this I think would be especially
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant in orchards.
[SPEAKER_01]: This project would likely be a good fit
with NSF, and particularly with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Division of Environmental Biology that
funded my graduate work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, one of the major
justifications of my research is to better
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how pollen affects human health
so that we can do something about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the projects I'm really excited
about is combining high-resolution pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure data with high-resolution asthma
exacerbation data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group that's doing this best right now
is a company called Propeller Health,
[SPEAKER_01]: which uses smart inhalers that provide
information on the time and location of
[SPEAKER_01]: each asthma inhaler usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've discussed combined combining our data
with them, and we think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to use this information,
both the fine-grained pollen exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: estimates with the fine-grained asthma
exacerbation data, to potentially create
[SPEAKER_01]: individualized dose response curves for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also opens up the possibility of
personalized forecasts, and Propeller
[SPEAKER_01]: Health, this company, they already help
users to manage their asthma, so there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear avenue for using these estimates of
airborne pollen concentrations to change
[SPEAKER_01]: how people are managing allergic diseases,
including asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a really good place to work on
this project would be New York City,
[SPEAKER_01]: in part because there are a lot of people
with allergies there and a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of data that I would need to
create models of airborne pollen there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also because I think there's a lot of
potential to collaborate with physicians
[SPEAKER_01]: at Weill Cornell Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having these types of personalized
forecasts and dose response curves would
[SPEAKER_01]: be a game-changing project from an
allergies perspective, and I think this
[SPEAKER_01]: would be very competitive for funding from
the National Institute of Environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: These research topics that I've been
talking about, there's a multitude of
[SPEAKER_01]: little projects within them that would be
excellent projects for graduate and
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to working with students on
this research in the future, and I also
[SPEAKER_01]: think that some of these topics could
apply well to both existing classes at
[SPEAKER_01]: SIPs and to new potential classes too,
such as a class on the links between
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since Chris mentioned it, this photo
here is actually from the class she
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, this new Intro to Ecology field
class that had about 100 master's students
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that class, we used active and
inquiry-based pedagogy, and those are
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches that I hope to use in teaching
in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To end my talk, I have two conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, that process-based approaches offer
an effective framework for modeling
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: My second conclusion is that the
combination of these research themes are a
[SPEAKER_01]: very useful toolkit, and today I've told
you about how I've applied them in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: ways in my own study system, but I'm also
excited to see how my methods could be
[SPEAKER_01]: used to answer questions in other systems,
including farms and orchards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the next couple of days,
I'm really excited to chat with you all,
[SPEAKER_01]: about ideas like this and also about the
potential for collaboration in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'd like to acknowledge
these institutions for their financial
[SPEAKER_01]: support, and I'd also like to thank some
of the many people who contributed to this
[SPEAKER_01]: research, both at the University of
Michigan and now at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas at Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I would be happy to take
your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there questions for Dan?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome to unmute or put them in
the chat, or I'm trying to open up all my
[SPEAKER_06]: windows here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have so many options.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nina, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Dan.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wondered about, obviously pollen
does cause allergies and causes reactions,
[SPEAKER_05]: but is there a possibility of looking at
this as a control group in a forested area
[SPEAKER_05]: as opposed to an urban tree area?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine there'd be more trees in a
more forested area than one in an urban
[SPEAKER_05]: area, and I just wondered if you looked at
sort of a control group of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a couple of reasons why
I've focused in on urban trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically that we interact the most
with the trees that are closest to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the incremental effect of an individual
tree in a city is much stronger on health
[SPEAKER_01]: than that of a tree in a forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are a bunch of really cool
questions that we can answer using these
[SPEAKER_01]: same approaches for more rural forests,
too, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there, though, one of the more
interesting sets of questions is about
[SPEAKER_01]: gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the same approaches could be
used for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to allergies, there's this
thing where people who live in rural areas
[SPEAKER_01]: also tend to develop fewer allergies
compared to people living in cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is another reason to focus more on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's another issue that there
are other aspects of urban life that cause
[SPEAKER_05]: allergies than pollen, you know,
basically automobile exhausts,
[SPEAKER_05]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a big factor, and that's
not really factored in with your model.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wondered if you had some response to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not factored into my model of
pollen exposure, but it is factored into
[SPEAKER_01]: epidemiological analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we need to do things
like figure out the effect of various air
[SPEAKER_01]: pollutants, including particulate matter,
for example, and ozone, which interacts a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit with pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also where we need to do things
like understand the effects of,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, viruses on emergency department
visits, just to reference the
[SPEAKER_01]: epidemiological analysis that I'm doing
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those things are important and
will affect the proportion of some health
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome that is attributable to pollen
specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, trees also do particulates in
areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they do particulates to land on
leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the particulates in the air tend to be
less where there are trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of different competing
issues here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if pollen alone is the major
issue in terms of asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the pushback here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's what you're making are
very good points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And however, just because there are other
issues doesn't mean we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand allergenic pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moreover, these same approaches are
really useful for doing things like
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how much particulate matter
these trees can filter out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that these are great points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be happy to go through it more
with you, because I think pollen is just
[SPEAKER_01]: one issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, we need to weigh both the
ecosystem services and the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: disservices that these trees are
providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is ultimately what should govern
our decisions about tree selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Josh, you had your hand raised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for a great talk, Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the beginning of your presentation,
you mentioned that I think you said pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: was becoming more allergenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mean on a per pollen grain basis
or contextually in the context of other
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental components?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm afraid it's both, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some good lab experiments that
show that plants grown in higher carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide concentrations produce pollen
grains that are on a per pollen grain unit
[SPEAKER_01]: more allergenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of that work has been done on
ragweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's on a per pollen grain basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to continue that line of thought,
I guess many secreted cell wall proteins
[SPEAKER_03]: in pollen are allergens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is anybody looking at that,
looking at the allergenic profiles of cell
[SPEAKER_03]: wall protein clusters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a little bit of work being
done on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to look in my literature
folder and see exactly what is being done
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly something which is of
interest to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I'll look a little bit more
at my papers and then give you a better
[SPEAKER_01]: answer in our one on one meeting.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a question in chat on pollen
morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really liked your talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want to say that I like the
use of Arduino to measure pollen release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had a question about whether or not
you're incorporating pollen morphology to
[SPEAKER_02]: inform your flowering models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only reason I ask is because I'm
not 100% sure about pollen grains in oak,
[SPEAKER_02]: across oak species.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go out on a limb here and ask you,
do you know if they have different
[SPEAKER_02]: morphology across species of oak?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if that's something that can
affect whether or not they're allergenic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have a couple of responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, oak pollen grains generally
look fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the standard practice in the field
of aerobiology is not to even try and
[SPEAKER_01]: identify what pollen grain comes from,
red oak versus from white oak or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, because you can't do it
reliably.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, there are differences in,
say, the allergenicity of different
[SPEAKER_01]: closely related species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if it's not something that we
can just see morphologically, just using a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope, it can have important
consequences for allergies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of gets at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you mean, I guess, characteristics of
allergenicity, are you referring to the
[SPEAKER_02]: shape of the pollen grain?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm referring more to what's inside the
pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are a variety of proteins
inside of pollen grains and substances
[SPEAKER_01]: which trigger allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those can vary a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is easier to quantify the variation in
the cellular content and specifically in
[SPEAKER_01]: the allergic reactions that the contents
of a pollen grain produce than it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that, hey, there's a slightly thicker
excine on this pollen grain than that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more about the protein composition
than it is about the shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, shape can be important for things
like how easily a pollen grain bursts and
[SPEAKER_01]: releases all of that stuff into the air,
which is a really important part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole story that I haven't had a chance to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just kind of thinking about
if, for instance, the excine is thicker on
[SPEAKER_02]: one pollen grain versus the rest of the
lot, then it would potentially disperse
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, I think, is something that we'll
need to do a little bit more of taking
[SPEAKER_01]: into account when it comes to dispersion
modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like the amount of water that a
pollen grain picks up is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed your talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a bunch of questions here from a
fellow plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interactions between pollen and fungal
spores, as many fungal spores are also
[SPEAKER_06]: allergenic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do your models take into account?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, so you may have been a little
surprised by how little we know about
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would be even more surprised by how
little the allergy community knows about
[SPEAKER_01]: airborne fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much harder to identify just with
a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know a lot less about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I think that there might
be some possibilities for using the
[SPEAKER_01]: framework that I've done here,
like figuring out source strength and the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of particulates released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there might be some potential to
do that with fungal spores, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should also mention that,
yeah, fungal spores are really important
[SPEAKER_01]: to allergies, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They generally are, there's a few national
allergy bureau stations that measure them,
[SPEAKER_01]: that measure fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not as common to include that in
this type of analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And David Rossiter asks, if you notice
differential wind effects in the Detroit
[SPEAKER_06]: study, he noticed cooler temperatures just
inland from Lake St. Clair.
[SPEAKER_06]: And could that be a wind effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've wondered a lot about the
effects of wind there myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's likely that some of the
distance from water is affecting things
[SPEAKER_01]: like temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, if things like wind
are something of, are adding extra
[SPEAKER_01]: variation, once we include that in our
models, then these models are just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's an area which I
would love to add more in on, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to allow me to make better
predictions of airborne pollen once we do
[SPEAKER_01]: things like incorporate variation in wind
across the city, as well as which
[SPEAKER_01]: direction the wind is blowing and how
strong and all that stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And somewhat related, Chelsea asks,
can you use your methods to track pollen
[SPEAKER_06]: for plants that are not wind pollinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really fun question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, my co-advisor is Shalini
Jha, who, in all of her work, is on insect
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think one of the really cool
topics here is, could we use some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: same methods to figure out the amount of
pollen production across an agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape or a wild landscape?
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, a buddy of mine from grad
school, Aaron Iverson, who just has been
[SPEAKER_01]: at Cornell for the last few years and now
got a faculty position elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been bouncing around the idea of
using some of these same methods to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of what the foraging landscape would
be like for a pollinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of cool possibilities for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one other question, which,
again, as a plant pathologist and someone
[SPEAKER_06]: who I have a project on rust fungi.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the spores of rust fungi can be highly
ornamented.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the question is actually, can your
model be applied to rust pathogen spores?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because several people online today are
allergic to rust pathogen spores.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, to some extent, you already
spoke to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the ureter spores tend to be wildly
wind blown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, I say, let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of our hemp students says,
I can't wait to see this type of modeling
[SPEAKER_06]: applied to pollen and pathogens in the
hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any final questions for Dan before we let
him go off to his next meetings?
[SPEAKER_06]: Chelsea?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a quick one, and it kind of
goes back to your Detroit study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize if I'm getting some of the
information wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was thinking about, you were
mentioning that there's a preponderance of
[SPEAKER_04]: cases where there's an increase in the in
certain communities for being hospitalized
[SPEAKER_04]: for asthma in particular areas that are
also associated with having greater
[SPEAKER_04]: densities of ragweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is a correlation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The causal links are a little more
tenuous, and I'm not going to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cannot in any way say that it is
ragweed that completely causes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there could be a fraction of that
which ragweed contributes to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was thinking about that from the
public health.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is this a place where the medical
practitioners could go in and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, look, this is an area that doesn't
have a lot of asthma knowledge?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can imagine also certain
communities just aren't even exposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: the health care system that would provide
them with understanding of how asthma can
[SPEAKER_04]: be both provoked and prevented in
children.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just thinking of this could be a way
that a collaboration with the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: community to say, hey, listen,
these are areas that are potentially high
[SPEAKER_04]: risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are communities where you could go
and do some public health educational
[SPEAKER_04]: services or offer clinics or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that is one of the most
important potential applications of this
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my other co-advisor here is an
allergist, Elizabeth Matsui.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her claim to fame is doing studies in
Baltimore that looked at how differences
[SPEAKER_01]: in pest control, specifically with mice,
affected people's risk of developing
[SPEAKER_01]: asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm a plant scientist, but I think
there's a lot of room here for these
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches to be used for public health
interventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm currently as a plant
scientist based out of a medical school
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the software.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a softball question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bill Crepe notes that the methods
could be used in forensic botany.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as an aside, Bill teaches a class,
oddly, in forensic botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually this really interesting
project that's being done largely at UT
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin now that's funded through the
Murray mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Department of Defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have this like, God, it's this
massively funded project to use some of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, to use pollen as a tracker for
figuring out where things have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, totally super useful for all of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Carlin has a question, but she's going
to ask it tomorrow because if I don't stop
[SPEAKER_06]: this, people will riot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Carlin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been really fun talking with you
today, Dan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope you enjoy your conversations
with folks across the School of
[SPEAKER_06]: Integrative Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone, please join me in thanking
Dan for a great seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll look forward to chatting with you
all over the next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
