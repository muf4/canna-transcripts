[SPEAKER_00]: Spotted wing drosophila is a small vinegar
fly native to Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first seen in the United States
when it was noted in Hawaii in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fly reached the mainland in summer of
2008 when it was brought to central
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this first year, spotted wing
caused an estimated $500 billion in
[SPEAKER_00]: damages, with some farmers recording crop
losses of up to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fly quickly traveled across the rest
of the country and is now widespread
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotted wing was first seen in New York in
the fall of 2011, but because the fly is
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively new to the northeast,
their damage has been difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, since we are now aware of the
threat that the fly poses, their
[SPEAKER_00]: populations are being monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotted wing is very similar to the fruit
flies that we are all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these flies have a serrated
ovipositor, allowing the females to lay
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs in underripe fruit, unlike other
drosophila species, which can only lay
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs in overripe or rotting fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females can lay up to 16 eggs in one day
and over 300 eggs in their lifetime,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be up to 9 weeks long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies have shown that up to 13
generations of flies can be produced per
[SPEAKER_00]: year and adults are capable of
overwintering.
[SPEAKER_00]: A respiratory horn, also called a sting,
shown here, indicates the oviposition site
[SPEAKER_00]: of the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eggs hatch within three days and larval
feeding immediately begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adulthood can be reached after only eight
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larval feeding causes the collapse of
fruit tissue, leaving the telltale
[SPEAKER_00]: indentations in berries, indicating that
the maggots are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This damage to the skin of the fruit also
makes it vulnerable to bacterial and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: When fruit that contains these eggs is
harvested, within two days the maggots
[SPEAKER_00]: will emerge, making the product completely
unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the only way to control spotted
wing is through the use of full coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays directed towards controlling adult
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is currently nothing that can be
done to salvage fruit that already
[SPEAKER_00]: contains developing eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprays must be applied weekly and it is
encouraged to use a variety of insecticide
[SPEAKER_00]: with different modes of action as a way of
preventing resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is not the ideal way to
control a pest as pesticide application
[SPEAKER_00]: here is based on a time schedule as
opposed to an IPM approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in heavy spraying,
which is both costly for farmers and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are also encouraged to closely
monitor their fruit and harvest it
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately once it reaches ripeness and
also to dispose of infested fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is that male flies become
sterile at 30 degrees, meaning that New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State's natural cold temperatures may
help limit their population growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: protect our fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As scientists continue to study spotted
winged drosophila and make discoveries
[SPEAKER_00]: such as this, we will be able to develop a
better pest management strategy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
