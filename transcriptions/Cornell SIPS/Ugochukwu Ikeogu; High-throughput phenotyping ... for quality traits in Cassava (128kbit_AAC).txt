[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you everyone for coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we're going to have a headway
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm presenting on high-through
pinotaping and genomics assisted breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for quality traits in the cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe for the record, my full name is
Sugetupiswa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the advert, Ugo, Ugo, Ugo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has landed me into trouble in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saying Ugo, and your name is
Sugetupiswa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be giving an account of my
five-year stay in Cornell, and then I will
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a little bit of background on
cassava, three studies that are part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: dissertation, and then some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Jean-Luc said, we're a little bit
trying to see things change in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a few other studies that are
not reported, but I'll just mention them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing, looking forward and
then thinking globally, we need to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: global and nutritional crisis,
which should be the vision of everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: here as a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to note here or see is like
there are millions of people who are in
[SPEAKER_00]: need of food all around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing I want to mention is
that this is from USAID.
[SPEAKER_00]: That food assistance needs, that of 2017,
it was unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we have some basic
drought-related things we can predict,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we might need so-so amount of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of natural hazards and all
the rest of them, insecurity problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: can lead to food insecurity and sudden
need for food around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't prepare, we have a little
space, and then we have a lot of need.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we don't have enough room,
create or produce more food, a time will
[SPEAKER_00]: come maybe a lot of people will be hanging
around, and then that will be disastrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're talking about global food
crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava is one of those crops we can
depend on to help us manage food,
[SPEAKER_00]: global food crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this quote from FAO, and it said
that cassava was once regarded as the food
[SPEAKER_00]: of the poor, but is now becoming one of
the crops that nations depend upon and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a crop that is affecting the global
economy of a lot of nations and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the developing countries, sub-Saharan
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava is a key crop that we look up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important because cassava,
more than 800 million people depend on
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava daily and globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a unique crop, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hardy and low-impute crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava can thrive well in the marginal
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing I want to emphasize
upon is that even though cassava is a food
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, it's also one of the crops to depend
upon to industrialize agriculture in most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another quote I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then trying to compare it to the
present condition where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite its potentials, cassava has the
lowest research intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been like an abandoned crop for
a while, but I want to say that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a period I tag as a new era in
cassava research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that era, I think, is marked with a
lot of increase in funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Gen is one of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basics and all that, I think,
gives foundation alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the figure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of investment and interest
in cassava research currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have abundance of genomic information,
improvement in computational and
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all storage in human and material
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, there is a heightening
demand for cassava, for food and biofuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in Asia and Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ongoing developments are creating
the urgent need for us to reshape how we
[SPEAKER_00]: do things and then meet up with the rising
demand for cassava products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in doing so, we need to understand
cassava breeding challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our ultimate goal is to increase genetic
gain over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that we can do when we take care
of so many important factors to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: our selection accuracy, selection
intensity, and above all, if we can reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding cycle of cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, by the way, has a very lengthy
breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes up to a decade for you to release
a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cassava has a poor flowering and seed
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have limited germplasm and diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have the need to get exposed
or have access to data tools, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: could range from phenotyping and data
management tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maybe a little bit of distraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads to some of the things I'll
be discussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the forced deny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of my dissertation,
is to look at the problem of phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I titled this, The Force for the Rapid
Quantification of Quality Traits in
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava Using Portable Neon
Infra-Respectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I need to mention here that most of
the quality traits we have, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve on cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of high troop and
standardized method of phenotyping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give an example using these
two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are carotenoid evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's easy to separate between
yellow and white clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have a lot of variation in
yellowness, it becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we usually do is a visual
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go far to go into laboratory
extraction or using high performance
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid HPLC chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing with all these method is
that one, they need laboratory,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need standard laboratory equipment,
you need skilled technicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we are talking about low resource
breeding institutions, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things could be challenging, having
constant light and power and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started thinking about, and these
are indirect methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say visual scoring is an indirect
method of quantifying carotenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of just getting a feel of the
total carotenoid, we are thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids have some other individual
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are just at the point of quantifying
for total carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going over to dry matter,
which cassava on this one is almost 60 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for whatever valuable component
that will come out from cassava,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to have a good feel of the dry
matter evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use the over method and specific
gravity method, also like what I emphasize
[SPEAKER_00]: here, is time consuming and low precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific gravity is just what you're
seeing in the diagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weigh it in air, dip it in water,
try to get the specific gravity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from there derive dry matter
content and starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people have been using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, there is a development in
the use of NIRS technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to show electromagnetic
radiation scale when we talk about NIRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have visible light here covering from
400 to 700 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NIRS may say it's between 700 to 1,100
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have medium infrared that
covers up to 2,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about NIRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: NIRS studies the interaction between
electromagnetic radiation and then matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier studies have proved that once
you expose a matter to electromagnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, it produces frequencies or
vibrational frequencies that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to quantify the chemical component of that
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have used it over time to quantify
and then quantify so many non-molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: components in many food samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are using it in health and in so many
other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the advantages of using NIRS in
phenotyping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to mention here that the NIRS
technology has been evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have a tabletop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the recent developments, we are having
handheld.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, maybe you see some people
have the MyGauss lab is working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are having NIRS tools in a very
portable format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one maybe good thing to think about
looking at the ranges and all the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I explained in the previous
slides, looking at what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure, whether it's just near,
mid-infrared or hovering between visible
[SPEAKER_00]: and near-infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the things I did was with the
handheld, which covers both the visible
[SPEAKER_00]: and mid-near-infrared regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NIRS is fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can scan a sample in a matter of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's non-destructive and inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one thing to know is that from
the same one spectrum, if you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration, you can derive a lot of
traits at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, when we are using NIRS, we are not
talking about waste and then other
[SPEAKER_00]: hazard-related disposal that are
associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a chemical and laboratory method.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you train people, this is just like
shooting a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just shoot and then it takes the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to be a scientist,
a chemist to use NIRS to collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about application of NIRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just get it and then you have to
do a little work about before you start
[SPEAKER_00]: using NIRS in your phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we go through calibration phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it involves is that first you
want to match your spectral data with a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for whatever trait you are interested
in, I maybe talk more about carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in total
carotenoids, you want to match the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral value we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to go through a little
bit of spectral pretreatment to correct
[SPEAKER_00]: for scarring and then differences in
nature of sample and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then match it with a reference method
value you get from the lab or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like the standard for measuring
that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to train your model,
develop a calibration model, train and
[SPEAKER_00]: then have your validation before you can
use it to process samples that have
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral value but don't have laboratory
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us in Cassava, one of the things we
are trying out is to have a field base
[SPEAKER_00]: because part of the things we consider
before going for this is we don't just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get a desktop that it sits in the
lab and also the one thing I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mention is that the desktop is also can be
affected by temperature and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also need Lysos and all the rest of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like having a standard
laboratory too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we needed something that is field based
and then that's why we went for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are asking can we just here we are
cutting a Cassava root and then scanning
[SPEAKER_00]: from that region and then take some scans
and then use it instead of coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab or carrying things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of one of our house
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are about eight hours
right from the normal station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to start establishing
laboratories in our stations and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is that we are trying to develop
calibration on intact Cassava root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing we are doing also
trying to just create things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went into construction, get somebody
that can help us with a grinder that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't depend on electricity so that you
can carry this all around and then even
[SPEAKER_00]: field based to grind and then homogenize
because for some traits in Cassava,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'll show a picture of if you have
seen Cassava, you have a variation in some
[SPEAKER_00]: trait concentration along the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to homogenize and then see how
that can also improve our calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for objective of this study is to
develop calibration for major traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about carotenoids,
we have been presenting most time total
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just remember that we have a lot
of components of carotenoids that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: that have health benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example is lutein.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we talk about night blindness,
trying to correct for carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lutein and other traits are actually
active though they are not pro-vitamin A
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids, but they are important in
taking care of eye related problems
[SPEAKER_00]: because they absorb the ultraviolet rays
that protects your eye against cataracts
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's also not just focus on total
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our aim is to develop calibration as
much as we can for individual carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry matter content and then like I said
earlier on, develop and probably compare
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrations between intact and marsh
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we try to see how far we've gone
comparing specific gravity method and over
[SPEAKER_00]: method from using our nearest derived dry
matter content to compare with the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing method for dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for reference and calibration
development throughout my work,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We develop calibration with people in
Seattle, Colombia, some were developed in
[SPEAKER_00]: national researches to take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for carotenoids, we use HPLC as a
reference and lab extraction method in
[SPEAKER_00]: NRCRI for dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly we use oven drying and then
specific gravity method.
[SPEAKER_00]: For models, I tried compared a lot of
pretreatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that your spectrum has
a lot of noise in addition to the real
[SPEAKER_00]: information you are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to see how much you can remove
the noise so that you can focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried both linear and non-linear models
and then for validation, tried cross
[SPEAKER_00]: validation between training and validation
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divided the calibration set we had into
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing you some results to just
emphasize that when we are comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration between intact and marsh
roots, I'm showing result on total
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids or transmittal carotenoid and
then total carotenoid at Tumudike just to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove like from here, I mean, there are a
lot of things, statistics to use to check
[SPEAKER_00]: your calibration model, but one of them is
R0 square in cross validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having this high value gives us the
assurance that we are doing something even
[SPEAKER_00]: from intact roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though when you compare in most of
the other trades like dry matter content,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had better calibration with marsh than
the intact, but they are still high enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can use for screening in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we tried doing is to compare
between the methods we are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, tried developing calibration
using specific gravity as a reference and
[SPEAKER_00]: then using oven method also as a
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us like the real value for
specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you fit the model with
specific gravity, you have a nearest
[SPEAKER_00]: value, predicted value from intact roots
using specific gravity as a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing for using the marsh cassava
root samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using the oven and you have a
prediction from nearest, from the intact
[SPEAKER_00]: and marshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can see here is that while
specific gravity, one thing we also did
[SPEAKER_00]: was to try to make sure we remove
outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will emphasize that we had a lot of
outliers in specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just use the raw data,
the correlation was really low,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we tried looking at it and then
removing things that we felt like were
[SPEAKER_00]: really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that too, we still had like the
relationship between oven method and
[SPEAKER_00]: specific gravity method is around 0.64 and
one thing to report as concerning use of
[SPEAKER_00]: nearest is that if we develop calibration
with the oven method and then comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: with nearest predicted, we're having high
correlations that gives us that confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that whatever that is predicted from the
nearest is something we can use that is
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the values we get if we're drying
it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried looking at some laboratory
values to check what's the cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we saving anything in deploying
nearest for phenotyping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me for the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I removed them for maybe security
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at two laboratories that are
doing nearest.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, so these are different laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to use the starch enzymatic
or calorimetric method in quantifying for
[SPEAKER_00]: starch, that takes you up to like $75 per
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I estimated that for us in a breeding
program like NRSRI, we have multi
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, we are starting to measure up
to have up to 4,000 samples in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you calculate that, that's giving
you more than $300,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we are using nearest, these are not
a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just specialized in using nearest
for calibrating for phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: For starch, that values drops to 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for us now, going back to maybe a
national breeding program, if I didn't use
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 200, but if I estimated both
calibration and then validating my model
[SPEAKER_00]: every year, I'm spending up to or
investing up to such amount using a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference, all I will be doing is having
zero points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spending is about 0.05 of this amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, if we apply this,
we are sure that we are saving a lot for
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not just I'm using one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are quantifying for carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not total carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go for selective, you have up to,
if you select more than that, like what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in HPLC with individual
carotenoids, you're having up to $125 per
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this, I think I want to conclude
that nearest provide a good phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative for the evaluation and
improvement of many traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this can also help us discover
some novel traits that we have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: quantifying in cassava breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The portable nearest is highly adaptable
for a few days screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even though we had higher
calibration in mash than on intact roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we had on calibration results we have
from the intact root is good enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: screening purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this saves time and then
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next study is to go back, have a
little more detailed study on carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since nearest opened the door for us
to measure individual carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to see how the individual
carotenoids correlate with total
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the ambassadors of
cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy here for you to a little bit
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a yellow cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it's looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are yellow ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see far away here, the
difference is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in terms of quantity,
we don't have so much to say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just that we want to check how
much we have in the raw samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's to be interested to also know the
retention of carotenoids when we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: products as Gary and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing to note is that most of the
studies will focus on, and I've made
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasis on this, on total carotenoid,
but it will be good to go deeper into the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objectives here will be to
understand both the phenotypic and
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic correlation between,
especially between TCC and other
[SPEAKER_00]: individual ones to know why we're
improving total carotenoids, whether we're
[SPEAKER_00]: also improving the other individual
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can understand some of the studies
that focus on TCC, do we know the regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are associated with variation and
those individual carotenoids and then
[SPEAKER_00]: check the option of using GS in improving
carotenoids content in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing we use here is that we had
about 994 clones and we analyzed this
[SPEAKER_00]: using a nonlinear resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed we are mainly linear model from
partial least square regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used, tried a nonlinear model because
one apart from nonlinear models capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear relationship between your
predictive and dependent and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-random helps you to capture other
relationships that are not there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also is a little bit direct and then makes
your results more interpretable than
[SPEAKER_00]: linear models that are based on latent or
principal component factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try using nonlinear models to
analyze this and then Umudike has like two
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The training population is just based on
when they were collected and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: have been managed into like replications
but we just call them TP1 and TP2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two replications for clone in a
trial and then for nears we had two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three samples per plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location, we have data from Umudike,
Otobi and Kano and we use more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 sleep markers for these and then
we focus on these traits that I've also
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the result I'll be showing here,
most of them are closely related to
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic and phenotypic correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm showing the narrow sense
heritability for all the traits and then
[SPEAKER_00]: for the correlations we saw more
importantly one of the encouraging thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is that is also shown before that all
transmittal carotene which is gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: value of beta carotene is highly
correlated with total carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are so sure that while we're
improving total carotenoids we're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: good feel of all transmittal carotene
which is like total beta carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other isomers of beta carotene
which are also they have also high
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation with TCC but one good thing to
report here is that for all the traits we
[SPEAKER_00]: studied they have positive correlation
with TCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some levels of negative correlation
between the traits but I think is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: news to know that while we are striving to
improve total carotenoids we are improving
[SPEAKER_00]: the other individual carotenoids too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For GS model I tried to put in some models
to check prediction for carotenoids so I
[SPEAKER_00]: will show these I hope you remember but
maybe I will emphasize on it in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide so that you don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing is that usually when you have
your raw data is like a usual practice we
[SPEAKER_00]: do a two-stage approach first feed in your
model and then take care of different
[SPEAKER_00]: factors and get your blob use your blob
like estimated value to fit in the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: blob so that you can get your estimated
reading values but the one stage this is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a prosy to the one stage means
fitting in everything from different
[SPEAKER_00]: locations at the same time so and then we
report calibration using single-trade and
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-trade we have seen that most times
you can improve the prediction of low
[SPEAKER_00]: heritable traits using it that are highly
correlated with other traits and we try
[SPEAKER_00]: using multi-trade method also and then we
compare that with nonlinear methods using
[SPEAKER_00]: random forest too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry I think I will I will I try to
cover it so that you can remember so you
[SPEAKER_00]: have trouble trying to remember was the
prediction accuracy for this so once more
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget that is a single-trade
two-stage prediction accuracy this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-trade linear model using a single
multi-trade and here you have the random
[SPEAKER_00]: forest in two-stage here you have
single-trade using one stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-trade one stage and then nonlinear
random forest one stage so we have values
[SPEAKER_00]: for that trade but I'm trying to use this
tree to illustrate that most times what we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw is that multi-trade to some extent was
we're doing a little bit better on average
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the single-trade model but
that reversed when we use the single-stage
[SPEAKER_00]: model so overall using nonlinear model was
doing a little bit better than linear
[SPEAKER_00]: model so the result is about the same for
that trait the next thing we did was to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit a GWAS model for other traits I hope
my stars are really showing very well I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried expanding and realized they
scattered so one thing we found out is
[SPEAKER_00]: that even though we didn't have any
significant heat on alpha carotenoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: phyotin for other traits we're able to
discover some regions that were
[SPEAKER_00]: significant for most of the traits we
studied especially in chromosome 1 for
[SPEAKER_00]: lutein we have up to about five regions
and then for total carotenoids and most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the beta carotene components so overall
we're able to track look at the genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: related to carotenoid in cassava and we
saw like two basic genes have been
[SPEAKER_00]: reported one this has been reported with
TCC and now we are reporting it not just
[SPEAKER_00]: for TCC but for other individual traits
and then there's also another gene we
[SPEAKER_00]: found out within those regions but then
for the other significant regions we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see a lot this has been reported in
many studies we didn't see but we found a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of genes that have biological
functions that we believe that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: further studies can help us understand the
relationship with carotenoids and other so
[SPEAKER_00]: in conclusion we have seen that if we are
utilizing NIRS it will facilitate not just
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding carotenoid we change the way
we are doing things if you know typing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that gives us a hope in further
studying the relationship between TCC and
[SPEAKER_00]: other component trees that we have not
been looking at and that can help us
[SPEAKER_00]: redefine our selection index and other one
good news is that we got a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between TCC and individual
traits and we verified a major trait
[SPEAKER_00]: region that has been reported for
variation in TCC alongside other regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that have not been previously reported and
we have shown with the level of accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: we got that we can use GS to improve
carotenoids in cassava so quickly trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure I have the time the last
study that is part of my dissertation is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the things I said we have access
to sleep marker information and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking how can we use it to redefine the
system in cassava so a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: background I'm showing a polycross we have
at Ubyaja and one thing we need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: back at is that and making control crosses
in cassava is very difficult one is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit obvious we have clones that
flower early two months from two months
[SPEAKER_00]: three months after planting and other ones
that delay but within the same clones that
[SPEAKER_00]: flower within the same flowering and that
have the same flowering habit we see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of variable flowering habits some clones
the open up early in the day so if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: used to crosses maybe it's very difficult
but this is something I did like every day
[SPEAKER_00]: so some clones will open between early in
the hours of the morning while some clones
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a crossing scheme and you are
waiting for the female maybe the male has
[SPEAKER_00]: opened and then where you need to color
flower the other one has not opened you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to wait some time before you go to
the next plot and come back you realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has opened behind you so a lot of
variation and then a lot of magic in
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava that you need to love before you
can endure and work in cassava because
[SPEAKER_00]: also so one of the things I did like
Jean-Luc said is managing casual workers
[SPEAKER_00]: we hire sometimes you have to hire up to
20 people for crosses and all the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: them is not cheap at all and producing
botanical seed when you are doing hard
[SPEAKER_00]: others kind of variation and then to get
seeds that you can completely say that
[SPEAKER_00]: these are true crosses most times using up
to designing a scheme of up to 20 clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the rest in a nursery scheme you
might end up getting 5,000 in a year and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not good enough for any valuable
breeding program so that is part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we are looking at all and what had
previously breeders have tried relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: form of open pollination to increase the
production of botanical seed for one
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and one of them is polycross which
is more like isolation and then you pick
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones that you are interested in and
then plant them in isolation and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: them to miss naturally so you don't have
the problem of trying to control it but
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem here is that you laugh with
parental information and so you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen donor and all the rest so they
have used it and then we are asking the
[SPEAKER_00]: question can we use the available marker
we have to see who can resolve and modify
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of scheme in cassava so you can
get a lot of seeds from open pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you need to match each of them to
progenies to their true parents so what we
[SPEAKER_00]: did was to design a polycross using the
same method I'm just showing a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: design on what you have to do you need a
good design so that you can implement this
[SPEAKER_00]: is not like well cassava is naturally an
out-crossing crop but you still need to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce a lot of designs so let's see
this is one clone so we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you randomize it such that you have the
possibility to increase the probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: each cross and terminating with a
neighboring clone that is not itself so
[SPEAKER_00]: for this we selected 29 clones from our
genomic selection pipeline those are
[SPEAKER_00]: having high GBVs and one thing also we
considered was trying to be sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones have about the same flowering
habits so that we don't introduce well
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava is an issue but then you still
need to you still see that between some
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers though they flower early but they
still have an overlap between the long
[SPEAKER_00]: ones so but we try to choose the ones that
have an average the similar flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: habit we try bringing them randomization
using modify this quasi Latin square
[SPEAKER_00]: design and then for isolation we tried
observing 50 meters looking for a few that
[SPEAKER_00]: has a kind of 50 meters distance from any
neighboring cassava for Biagia we
[SPEAKER_00]: succeeded we were lucky we spoke with the
Yam breeding program so they gave us a
[SPEAKER_00]: site within the Yam breeding program and
Yam experiments so we had a lot of Yam
[SPEAKER_00]: around this side and then we were sure
that we don't have any neighboring cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: clone around but for this study well the
effect of the seed production we succeeded
[SPEAKER_00]: in getting up to 17,000 seeds that we
processed and for Biagia there were more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 25,000 people just harvested and I
know that Biagia supports more flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: and seed production but that shows us that
with these in terms of seed production at
[SPEAKER_00]: least we are covered and then we are faced
with the issue of how do we is it possible
[SPEAKER_00]: we can at least derive or have a hold on
the parental clones that contributed to
[SPEAKER_00]: those proteins so we use about three to
eight seeds a clone out of the 29
[SPEAKER_00]: replications we had in the field and one
approach of the parentage is using a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship matrix our idea is that if
genomic markers across the genome can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used to measure genetic similarities can
we look at the genomic matrix and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: the coefficients of relationship matrix to
say something about parentage and
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship of clones progenies with
their parents so for that also we tried
[SPEAKER_00]: another approach using an analyze
regression so we looked at this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: regression problem and trying to fit the
genotype of each progeny at a time against
[SPEAKER_00]: that of all the protective parents that
are involved in the scheme and then get
[SPEAKER_00]: the coefficients and then using lasso as a
restriction to pull down some coefficients
[SPEAKER_00]: that are around zero to zero so the data
sets we use for this we try simulating
[SPEAKER_00]: data sets to represent typically what we
can have in our breeding program we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple model where we have like from each
by print across we have one seed and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we for here we assume like we have like a
uniform and random distribution going from
[SPEAKER_00]: parents to progenies and another case we
tried is simulating the second one but
[SPEAKER_00]: here we use an early frequencies using one
of the data from the crossing mostly of
[SPEAKER_00]: our program just getting the whole thing
and then using even the number of snips
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next thing and also we tried to
increase the number of progenies so we
[SPEAKER_00]: have progenies are related in the scheme
and also the last thing we did was sorry I
[SPEAKER_00]: should have reference we use the reading
language scheme to bring in a level of
[SPEAKER_00]: since we are assuming that we have a
random distribution and then inheritance
[SPEAKER_00]: here can we account for linkage and then
in case in a pool where we had before
[SPEAKER_00]: those as always our crossing or have a
mixture of two crosses and surface is
[SPEAKER_00]: there where we can separate between so we
try simulating a data set that has both
[SPEAKER_00]: true self and then true and crosses we
also got data from our breeding programs
[SPEAKER_00]: NACRI and IIT here they are crossing
largely we had about 379 crosses from
[SPEAKER_00]: NACRI and then several and 64 progenies
coming from a mixture of 80 parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: then lastly we use those methods to check
the polycross experiment we had in FOMO-DK
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2015 so the prediction assignment we
got one here reporting the three methods
[SPEAKER_00]: or the two methods and then for the
simulated data set we were able to account
[SPEAKER_00]: to say okay the two parents there are two
recorded parents how accurate are we in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting two of them so what we did is to
rank the coefficients we got from the two
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and then the top most two we want
to like give them the chance or assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that they should be the parents of the
progeny involved so for those top two
[SPEAKER_00]: parents how sure how do they relate with
the reading record so for the simulated
[SPEAKER_00]: results we had hundred percent accuracy
using the two methods but when we go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the data from the breeding programs we had
a level of a shift in accuracy is not 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: but then some of them were a bit low and
then for predicting male so showing like
[SPEAKER_00]: okay if they wrote male how accurate are
we in predicting the male that is recorded
[SPEAKER_00]: against predicting the male that is
recorded for that project in all we
[SPEAKER_00]: realize our accuracies were slightly
higher in penalized regression than easily
[SPEAKER_00]: realized relationship method even though
most of them were still like about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same range but accuracies in female were
mostly better than in male which ordinary
[SPEAKER_00]: should be the case because you are
harvesting seeds from the female plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: well while we are still asking a lot of
questions this is one of the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: studies there's still room for development
and improve on some other things but we
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking back on some of the things
that can affect or alter your expected
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome some of them range will range from
long receptivity of the stigma cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma the normal process usually you you
you make a cross you cover for about 48
[SPEAKER_00]: days but a 48 hours but now we are seeing
that from some experiments that are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up especially from sead they are telling
us that some of those them still stay
[SPEAKER_00]: viable or receptive to five days so you
might have to change it could be possible
[SPEAKER_00]: that what you cross was not the one that
was taken and clone misleveling that was
[SPEAKER_00]: also affected the experiment we had at
umudike we give people a design like row
[SPEAKER_00]: column and then somebody is reading a plot
number in a zigzag method while we give
[SPEAKER_00]: you from one direction one to 29 and you
should come back to from here but somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: starts from this side so those things also
it can also happen when we are cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava use proteins and how that could
introduce misleveling in the field that
[SPEAKER_00]: what you are calling a clone might
actually be something else bagging
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions with experience I realize that
it's not like maze where you bag and then
[SPEAKER_00]: throw away we use bags even sometimes over
years and that is giving us an idea maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we should start asking questions looking
at what is the effect of those bag usage
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they are open holes that these
also eventually used to cross a clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: while we cover and think we have covered
they were not really covered so those are
[SPEAKER_00]: some issues you know typing error so we
are still trying to understand more about
[SPEAKER_00]: the study and like I said is the initial
one another thing we ask is okay we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to separate between two crosses and where
you have problem surfing events so we try
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at the coefficient so here I'm
showing a plot of the top most number one
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted parent the coefficient of the
top most parent and then the second one so
[SPEAKER_00]: when you plot it we are seeing a kind of
pattern that most of them are within the
[SPEAKER_00]: true process are within contribution of
50% from both parents are there about for
[SPEAKER_00]: them for self materials we are having
something higher than that is higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 here because we use a percentage of
all the coefficients we have so you might
[SPEAKER_00]: ask why is it above 100 so so with that
also we try to get the ratio between these
[SPEAKER_00]: the coefficient of the first one and the
second one and we realize that if is about
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 50 percent contribution it should be
about one or there about what values that
[SPEAKER_00]: are both three or that we give them a red
sign most of them should be self materials
[SPEAKER_00]: so the same thing goes with the other
method I'm just trying for the lasso
[SPEAKER_00]: method so in conclusion we can easily use
the abundant marker information to
[SPEAKER_00]: redesign one the advantage we have here is
that we have access to abundant seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use to increase our diversity
improve accuracy and then if we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good recombination between those trade
that's also given a good news that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use the method in current genomic
selection scheme and one other thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can with this method be able to
have a hold on the true parents of those
[SPEAKER_00]: are proteins and that will give us also if
we are talking about combination in all
[SPEAKER_00]: from our results we use 29 parents and in
most of the methods up to 28 parents even
[SPEAKER_00]: though we use about 60% of the seeds we
generated showed up as one of the top two
[SPEAKER_00]: parents so what is showing us I will have
a good code of random combination of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents you have in our population so
that's good and then we can be thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about trying to compare and get combining
abilities between those parents and that
[SPEAKER_00]: can also be defined what we do in cassava
you can start thinking about it so in all
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right to be time nears can promote
phenotyping of known and emerging quality
[SPEAKER_00]: traits we can use improve phenotyping
coupled with abundant genomic information
[SPEAKER_00]: a good hold in statistical tools to do
more in identified regions that are that
[SPEAKER_00]: are significant for variation in most of
the known traits and currently we are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some work to identify some end-user
preference traits so we still need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a good hold of good in phenotyping for
those traits and then we can use you know
[SPEAKER_00]: wide predictions to fast track genetic
gain and shorten cassava breeding cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and the last thing I showed is that if we
use the abundant markers we can we started
[SPEAKER_00]: a good we have a good results we are still
going to study more and then develop on it
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we can do that that gives us a good
hold on changing the pattern and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: method reshaping and redesigning breeding
method in cassava so I want to just
[SPEAKER_00]: mention those of our time some of that
studies I was fully involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing GS in NRSRI I have data for
calibration for starch and pasting
[SPEAKER_00]: property in cassava I'll be working on
that after now I this part of the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mentoring program one of the MSc students
are in the next gen is trying to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: the other methods that people have
developed for TCC I chair and using
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive color chart so over saw trying
to also help me as graduated and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things we try doing we have data for
working at the end of the program trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to standardize that lies between the
desktop so see it has a desktop nears and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the portable nears and they have
developed cassava calibration base for
[SPEAKER_00]: three years of for modern so we're trying
to see how we can standardize between the
[SPEAKER_00]: two devices and possibly inherit your
database in helping us improve our own
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration model in Africa and then I was
involved in few studies trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand any user preferences and all so
publication we have some of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: already written and then ready to go this
one was like collaboration and then trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to put some somebody up the newest
technology to so we submitted it just like
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks or three weeks ago and the first
study will publish in plus one and then
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in general GS and then let's jump
projects so with this a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people I have the best committee members
and then thanks to our lab members both
[SPEAKER_00]: sores lab and looks love want to thank
people like Denise and all the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: them imagine force in and is here everyone
and most importantly I want to thank the
[SPEAKER_00]: guest foundation and maybe gets himself I
wish I mean sometimes I think he has the
[SPEAKER_00]: option of using his money for something
else but that's good wheel in trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in cassava research has seen some
of us so I want to appreciate we have
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with a lot of people it's
yet and I said I'm not me and all the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: and all somebody I want to mention she was
one of the people that encouraged me to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply for the first time I think I don't
think I know much about yes so I wish
[SPEAKER_00]: she's around to pay her that I went for it
and then I'm presenting today well those
[SPEAKER_00]: are some of the old stories and all the
rest I want to thank my family it was
[SPEAKER_00]: rough my wife and I have a little boy that
is trying to reshape my life it was
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult all the way especially in 2013 I
almost gave up like one of the shocking
[SPEAKER_00]: moments lost one of the people that were
so close to me about logical mom she told
[SPEAKER_00]: me go I'll be there to receive you when
you finish so those are emotional moments
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told myself today I will try and
behave myself so thanks for listening and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll be happy to make some questions
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was your second second chapter
or whatever talking about you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: single step model and two-step model and
for some reason for two-step was doing
[SPEAKER_03]: better than the one step now there's no
reason why I mean there's no reason why
[SPEAKER_03]: that you should be different right unless
either the true values that you're using
are different between them or or do you
have an explanation for that I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: really confused so why they would be
different so for here when you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: the single state model for single traits
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean using the single stage and
another thing to add to it we had reps and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the rest of them because we don't have
balanced data we only use location and set
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had like something higher than the
two-state I mean once they should be the
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal thing but I don't know if there are
people from Geneva
[SPEAKER_02]: any other questions go ahead go for it um
do you think of Casabas like taro I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a Hawaiian root do you think of
those as similar sorry I'm not sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: that sensible a question arrow it's a
Hawaiian root vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: also yeah yeah they don't they are all
root crops thought I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: features of roots this is quite a little
bit different and then arrow is always
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little small and then different and
Casaba is almost like a shrub so yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: different yeah but they are all root crops
in the last chapter there was a thing
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're predicting which was the male
which was the female data the females not
[SPEAKER_03]: a hundred percent right yeah if somebody
recorded which plant they took it off of
[SPEAKER_03]: and that plant is the correct plan yeah
then you should that should be a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: percent right so then is is that can you
go to that slide is that female value
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially the maximum possible without
changing you know without quality human
[SPEAKER_03]: quality control and then and then if
that's true yeah like so for example in
your empirical one there like let's say
the penalized regression the females like
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 percent male 76 so so if you think
about your ability to actually predict
[SPEAKER_03]: that it it's really a lot better than yeah
yeah then you then you're saying right so
[SPEAKER_03]: so I guess is there a way that you can ask
the question of how how you should so how
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get those female prediction
actresses to be better from yeah I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: this initial thing and then when we saw
the result everybody was like okay we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to check back and then ask a lot of
questions we had discussion with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding programs and people and even
we see it that was when Sabalo stood as
[SPEAKER_00]: that covering and removing the bag within
two days doesn't solve the problem some
[SPEAKER_00]: things could also happen but then for
female we actually expected to have like
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent accuracy if everything is
all right so like I said there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors we are not sure of but we're
looking up to see how much we can do and
[SPEAKER_03]: if possible going forward set up more like
a lot of things coming to me you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: stem proteins and most times these are
done by casual workers and you are having
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 they are cutting every day one is
flying from here to at the other point you
[SPEAKER_00]: can also mix up clones and all that so a
lot of things that we have to we are
[SPEAKER_00]: improving trying to improve quality
control in cassava so we use the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: markers we're using for GS I know yeah I
know some people have done some studies
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at that you can use up to our
stocking with someone that developed this
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon package he said that from his own
experience he can use up to like he was as
[SPEAKER_00]: low as 200 if you are sure there is a lot
of polymorphism between those trades that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can capture use as low as 200 or
thereabouts so but for us we didn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: into that some people have done some
studies on that but we just felt like a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple thing we're using I still want to
run it maybe within my GS pipeline not
[SPEAKER_00]: going into extra work to genotype or look
for specific markers to do that if I just
[SPEAKER_00]: use a random and then simple
straightforward approach that I can do
[SPEAKER_02]: that I mean my observation was more based
on the fact that if your accuracies are
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and the cost of genotyping is
high it would be much more to fix the
[SPEAKER_02]: human problems because it's very cost
effective and you can improve those
[SPEAKER_02]: accuracies all ready because you're really
investing over investing in genotyping if
[SPEAKER_00]: that of those other problems are still or
go on so there is so Manan is here he's
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality champion quality control
champion so is a new initiative we are
[SPEAKER_00]: asking a lot of questions we are seeing a
lot of things and we are getting to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: people questions can we change the way
people are doing things even in region and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a uniform method of region our
fields collect in data and other so those
[SPEAKER_02]: things are in check we'll try and do that
but it's a great thesis the way these hold
[SPEAKER_02]: together as you pick off problems and give
people an idea of how to move forward you
[SPEAKER_02]: improve things that can be improved and
then the other improvements will come and
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you improve that rate of
genetic gain everybody will be inclined to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to improve what they do so I just
want to say I think you've done a great
[SPEAKER_02]: job of looking at phenotyping,
genotyping, crossing, experimental design,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that in a whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it mean we're going to pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think already I have one yes from my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a yes already so let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right I think with that I want to say
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu Thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
you
