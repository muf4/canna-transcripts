[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to do my best to use the
mouse as a pointer here so that everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: can see in both locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my great pleasure to give an overview
of our research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to touch on a number of projects
that we've got going, but there are a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of projects that I don't have time
to get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to break up my talk into
four sections here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an overview of what I'm going to
talk about, starting with the most applied
[SPEAKER_02]: and ending with the most basic aspects of
our research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start by talking about the overall
agronomic system of growing shrub willow
[SPEAKER_02]: as a bioenergy crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give an overview of our breeding program
and some of the unique aspects of breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about our emerging resources for
mapping in willow, both QTL mapping and
[SPEAKER_02]: association mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then get to a project that's funded by
the Department of Energy, their feedstock
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics program, where we're trying to
look at the genomic basis for heterosis in
[SPEAKER_02]: triploid hybrids of willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the typical land that we target
to grow willow on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Willow as a pioneer species will do well
on marginal ag land, and it is a crop that
[SPEAKER_02]: we aim to avoid the conflict between food
and fuel by targeting underutilized or
[SPEAKER_02]: abandoned ag land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a site at Vernon Verona
Sherrill High School near Rome,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York that is typically typical of a
lot of the abandoned or underutilized ag
[SPEAKER_02]: land in the Northeast and upper Midwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: With willow, we can convert that
marginally profitable land back to more
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional agriculture, although very
low input and very low labor requiring
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we planted willow at the high school
here in 2010, I'm sorry, in spring of
[SPEAKER_02]: 2009, and this is what it looked like by
October of 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that high school, they have a very
active FFA program where they make maple
[SPEAKER_02]: syrup, and they're actually harvesting the
willow to burn in their evaporators while
[SPEAKER_02]: they make maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an overview of the willow
agronomic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are aiming to develop conservation
tillage as a method of site preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see here that the first thing we have
to do is kill the existing vegetation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and as a part of that, for both weed
management and nutrient management,
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Fabio in my lab is doing a lot of
work on first planting cover crops as a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of that site preparation,
but we've also been working with
[SPEAKER_02]: Agronetics, a company in Rochester,
to use GPS guidance for zone tillage,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what you see here, followed up by
GPS guided planting using one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical planters.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was built in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're planting dormant cuttings,
stem cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, these are whips that are about seven
or eight feet long that the planter will
[SPEAKER_02]: cut into eight inch pieces and push into
the ground as it moves along.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plant in a double row system with 30
inches between the rows with either a five
[SPEAKER_02]: or a six foot alley between those double
rows with two feet between the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving us a planting density of about
6,000 plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cuttings will root fairly readily
and push buds to make new shoots that will
[SPEAKER_02]: grow about five or six feet tall by the
end of that establishment year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we take advantage of the natural
biology of willow by cutting them back or
[SPEAKER_02]: coppicing them, which then stimulates
vigorous regrowth in the start of that
[SPEAKER_02]: second year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we discard the biomass that's
produced in that establishment year,
[SPEAKER_02]: once those plants are established,
they will vigorously re-sprout after each
[SPEAKER_02]: cutback.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of that first year after
coppice, or the second year of production
[SPEAKER_02]: on that site, we typically have growth of
12 to 15 feet tall, and our normal
[SPEAKER_02]: production cycle would go on a three year
harvest rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: By which time the plants are 20 to 25 feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We harvest in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically we're planting on poorly drained
sites that are wet, so in the winter it is
[SPEAKER_02]: an advantage to have the ground frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a time when forage harvesters like
this New Holland Forage Harvester are not
[SPEAKER_02]: typically being used, so that harvesting
operation can switch off their corn fields
[SPEAKER_02]: and turn harvesting head and put on a
willow cutter head and continue to use
[SPEAKER_02]: that machinery through the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a time when we need chips for
heating, and obviously it's a time when
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants are dormant, so it's a good
time to cut them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that all the leaves have
fallen and returned back to the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: recycling those nutrients in the leaves
back to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those wood chips then would be collected
blown into a truck, taken to the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversion facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you see a whole truck dumper at a
power plant just north of Rome,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York, where they're piling up chips to
load into their boiler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again that following spring the plants
would vigorously re-sprout, starting a new
[SPEAKER_02]: growth cycle, a new three year harvest
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We model the economics based on seven of
these three year harvest cycles,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's good evidence from Sweden that
yield is maintained for at least 10
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest cycles, so there's really no end
in sight in the productivity of a willow
[SPEAKER_02]: plantation once it's established.
[SPEAKER_02]: That biomass can be used in a number of
different conversion processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in New York State we have three wood
fired power plants, and willow is more
[SPEAKER_02]: than adequate fuel for those power plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an emerging market for feedstocks
for liquid transportation fuels,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in fact the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government has set some very aggressive
targets to produce 20 billion gallons of
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced renewable biofuels by 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're nowhere close to getting to that
point because the technology for that
[SPEAKER_02]: conversion is lagging behind and it is
quite expensive at this point compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: petroleum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another viable market that we have in the
northeast is to use wood for renewable
[SPEAKER_02]: heating, and this is a small scale boiler
that we've installed here in Geneva to
[SPEAKER_02]: heat two of our buildings entirely fueled
by willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Willow can also readily be pelletized and
used in pellet stoves or pellet boilers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a fair amount of work to look
at the wood composition of willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That composition will be critical for many
of these liquid biofuels conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so critical, but even still,
thermochemical combustion or
[SPEAKER_02]: thermochemical conversion to liquid
transportation fuels will also have its
[SPEAKER_02]: own optimal biomass composition,
and we see quite a bit of variation in
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass composition among our different
varieties in our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, that's about all that I
have time to talk about in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass composition, but it is a critical
trait for these different conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to emphasize that willow is a viable
commercial crop and that the government is
[SPEAKER_02]: invested in developing willow as a crop,
in 2011, the USDA initiated a program to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, to provide planting subsidies for
willow in northern New York specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: This overall program is called the Biomass
Crop Assistance Program, and our area in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York among these nine counties,
I believe it is, is specifically to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: 75% of the establishment costs to plant
willow, provide an annual land payment,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to link the harvest of that willow
with conversion in local power plant
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, these three wood-fired power
plants that I talked about, one at Fort
[SPEAKER_02]: Drum called Black River, this one just
north of Rome, the Lionsdale power plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and one up near Messina, the Chattagay
power plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those power plants are then paying a
contract price set by the BCAT program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have about 1,200 acres, about 500
hectares or so of shrub willow in
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial production in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about 20,000 acres in production
in Sweden, in Denmark, in England,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing production in Poland, and Ukraine,
Hungary, so it is a viable commercial crop
[SPEAKER_02]: being developed for renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sort of summarizes our production
system, our agronomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just want to point out that there
are significant barriers to adoption of
[SPEAKER_02]: willow, including the high cost of
establishment, the cost of cutting
[SPEAKER_02]: production is limiting factor compared to
seed production, such as for switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a system that needs specialized
planting and harvesting equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of which is built in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: New Holland has invested in developing
their own willow cutterhead that is
[SPEAKER_02]: matched with their self-propelled forage
harvesters, but still there is a lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: commercially available planting and
harvesting equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key point that leads into the next
section of my talk is that the economics
[SPEAKER_02]: of biomass production of willow is
dramatically improved when we get
[SPEAKER_02]: increased yields per acre, as you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So breeding for improved yield for more
stable production across marginal sites is
[SPEAKER_02]: a critical factor for the long-term
adoption of willow as a renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to move into talking about
our willow breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, establishing our goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: First goal, well, the first three goals
are all yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I just mentioned, fitting that into the
economics of the system, the more you
[SPEAKER_02]: yield per acre, the more we will encourage
adoption.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a perennial crop that will stay in
the ground for as long as 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So long-term durable pest and disease
resistance is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, wood composition is a
critical aspect for matching feedstocks to
[SPEAKER_02]: conversion technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also always need to be conscious of
the cost of cutting production and stool
[SPEAKER_02]: form and plant form, crown form,
branching, for example, is a critical
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect for efficient cutting production as
well as harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now moving into looking at aspects
of stress tolerance as well for
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly marginal sites, and I'll show
you that one type of site we're very
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in is reclaimed mine land in
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping all of these goals in mind,
an underlying premise that we work with is
[SPEAKER_02]: that we want to maintain a genetically
diverse suite of pedigrees among our
[SPEAKER_02]: commercially deployed cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we are planting clonal material,
we always want to maintain a high level of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic diversity in the field to hedge
against any individual cultivar failure
[SPEAKER_02]: due to pest and disease susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our overall approach and strategy in
breeding willow is to rely on species
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization, and the hybrid vigor or
heterosis that we observe in species
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here I've got pictures of three people
who have been critical over the years in
[SPEAKER_02]: actually doing the controlled pollinations
and the crosses that we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting in 1998 and 99, Rich Kopp,
who was one of my PhD students at SUNY
[SPEAKER_02]: ESF, really developed our techniques for
extracting pollen, doing controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinations in the greenhouse,
did our initial hybridizations,
[SPEAKER_02]: and many of our current commercial
cultivars are genotypes that Rich bred,
[SPEAKER_02]: many of which we've now patented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim Cameron took over for Rich and did a
number of very successful crosses in 2002
[SPEAKER_02]: through 2005, which I'm going to talk
about as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working as a postdoc in my lab first at
ESF and then helping me move here to
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more recently, Sam Napka, who was a
Hobart student, helped out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse over the last two years helping
to manage and maintain thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a real asset to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the features of Salix,
and I'm going to distinguish Salix from
[SPEAKER_02]: Populus, the two main species in the
Salicaceae, one of the features of Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: is the tremendous species diversity that
we see in that genus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are over 300 species of Salix,
while in Populus there are only,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, 34 different species,
and they range from dwarf sprawling alpine
[SPEAKER_02]: shrubs to the weeping willow or black
willow trees that we're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work exclusively with species in the
subgenus vitrix, which are primarily shrub
[SPEAKER_02]: form willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow with multiple small diameter
stems, never really achieving a single
[SPEAKER_02]: stem like the tree form willows do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in particular, we're working primarily
within the section helix and making
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses with the section dimmin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you see there is great potential for
species hybridization here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another feature that's unique about Salix
especially compared to Populus is the
[SPEAKER_02]: abundance of polyploidy across the genus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this particular scheme of species
that we work with in our breeding program,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see that Salix myabiana from Japan
is tetraploid, a natural tetraploid,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Salix dacicledos, very common in the
European breeding programs, is hexaploid,
[SPEAKER_02]: while all the other species here are
diploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna talk about some of our genomics,
and we focused in on Salix purpurea as a
[SPEAKER_02]: reference genome for our initial genome
sequencing efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a central species in our breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a consistent diploid, but you can
see that it is a good species to hybridize
[SPEAKER_02]: with many of the other species in section
helix and also across sections here,
[SPEAKER_02]: with members of dimmin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also gonna talk about, in our work on
triploids, crosses between Salix purpurea
[SPEAKER_02]: and Salix myabiana, as well as crosses
between Salix viminalis, which is the main
[SPEAKER_02]: species in the European willow breeding
programs, and Salix myabiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can imagine, these crosses between
tetraploids and diploids will generate
[SPEAKER_02]: triploid progeny, and that will be an
ongoing theme here through the rest of my
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since 1998, this is a list of all of the
different species combinations that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been able to produce over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've underlined the species that are
triploid, so you see a significant number
[SPEAKER_02]: of those, progeny or triploid,
but we have the capability to combine
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple species here and our long-term
strategy is for overall improvement of
[SPEAKER_02]: diploid species independently of
tetraploids to make that final F1
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization between the diploid and the
tetraploid-generating triploid progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I moved to Cornell in 2009,
we've produced about 10,000 sieving
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny, representing our next round of
potential cultivars for selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up till now, we've largely been relying
on phenotypic selection, and the other
[SPEAKER_02]: willow breeding programs, the main ones
being in England and in Sweden as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: have been relying on phenotypic selection,
and this is our overall scheme that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been using.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, to do those controlled pollinations
in the greenhouse, producing seed that we
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately sow and get started in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: In midsummer, we transplant those out to
the field, so here we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of progeny outplanted to the
field here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you see, we're doing in our nursery
beds here in Geneva, and then typically,
[SPEAKER_02]: we would evaluate seedlings within family
rows in those nursery beds and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: selection on the order of 10 to 15% within
the best families, and then propagate
[SPEAKER_02]: those to replicated selection trials,
and these have only been on single sites,
[SPEAKER_02]: and here we're talking about on the order
of 60 to 80 genotypes that are advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: into these selection trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, from analysis of those selection
trials, we select on the order of 12 to 15
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes to advance into regional yield
trials, where it's critical to evaluate
[SPEAKER_02]: genotype by environment interactions,
to look at their response to varying pest
[SPEAKER_02]: and disease pressure on different sites,
their response to different soil types and
[SPEAKER_02]: climate conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, that phenotypic selection
process takes us to regional yield trials
[SPEAKER_02]: within four to seven years, and our
overall cycle of identifying new cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: runs on a cycle of about 10 to 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went through that process,
again, using genotypes that Rich caught
[SPEAKER_02]: bred in 1998, 1999, got those into yield
trials that were planted from 2005 up
[SPEAKER_02]: through 2008 across New York State,
and through collaboration across many
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of North America, all the way from
Montreal, Quebec, out to Waseca,
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota, just south of Minneapolis,
even in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are our target regions,
the Northeast and Upper Midwest and
[SPEAKER_02]: Southern parts of Canada, and you can see
when we look at the yield of the top five
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes in each of these trials,
and compare them with the foundation
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding material that we had in Syracuse
originally, and yield trials that were
[SPEAKER_02]: managed by my colleagues, Tim Volk and
Larry Abrahamson, those new cultivars from
[SPEAKER_02]: first round of breeding produced about a
30 to 35% increase in yield overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our success in one round of
breeding through capturing heterosis of
[SPEAKER_02]: species hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Among those cultivars that we tested in
those yield trials, we have now patented
[SPEAKER_02]: eight of them, and those are licensed by
the Research Foundation of SUNY to a very
[SPEAKER_02]: active and collaborative nursery producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of you know through his primary
business, which is producing wine grape
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings, Dennis Rack at AA Willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he now is the main source of planting
stock for commercial growers in North
[SPEAKER_02]: America with production capacity of about
30 million cuttings per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough for five to 6,000 acres of
willow each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna highlight again that many of
these cultivars are hybrids between the
[SPEAKER_02]: diploid salix viminalis and tetraploid
salix myoviana, or between the diploid
[SPEAKER_02]: salix purpurea and tetraploid salix
myoviana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have now continued to advance our
breeding program, and our next round of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic selection trials was planted here
in Geneva in 2008, again with 75
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We harvested that the first time in 2011,
and from those genotypes bred in 2002 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 2005, and some in 2001, again we have
captured about a 15% increase in yield
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to our current commercial
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are now, have now been advanced
to regional yield trials to do that same
[SPEAKER_02]: type of genotype by environment
interaction testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're getting into the yields of
17 dry metric tons per hectare per year
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really going to have an impact on
the economics of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am very fortunate to be a member of a
USDA funded project to develop willow and
[SPEAKER_02]: switchgrass as bioenergy crops in the
Northeast U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's led by Penn State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our contribution to this project,
which we call New Bio, was to establish a
[SPEAKER_02]: new round of regional yield trials through
collaboration with SUNY ESF, AA Willow and
[SPEAKER_02]: Fredonia, folks at Penn State,
Marvin Hall and John Carlson, including a
[SPEAKER_02]: site on reclaimed mine land, collaboration
with Steve DeFazio at West Virginia
[SPEAKER_02]: University, and with Ray Miller up in
Eskima of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we expect that once we have the results
of this new round of yield trial,
[SPEAKER_02]: we will advance at least a couple new
cultivars to commercial production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we recognize that our potential to
capture those yield improvements is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting smaller and smaller, meaning that
we need to be more precise in our
[SPEAKER_02]: selection methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have recently moved to planting to
not relying so heavily on unreplicated
[SPEAKER_02]: performance in these family row trials in
nursery beds, but rather propagating all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the genotypes that we produce in a
family and testing them now in replicated
[SPEAKER_02]: trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can imagine, these are getting very
large.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pick almost 300 genotypes,
or here we have 1,100 genotypes replicated
[SPEAKER_02]: in four reps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to do this on multiple sites,
but even on one site, this is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: plots to go out and measure and evaluate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is what we have done here in
2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred Goukher, my PhD student, is managing
this trial, and Craig Carlson,
[SPEAKER_02]: my third PhD student, is managing this
trial both here in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so to summarize, our current
strategy for breeding salix hybrids is to
[SPEAKER_02]: capture heterosis through species
hybridization, especially to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That our initial selections produce some
impressive yield gains, but in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain those, we will need to get more
precise and produce larger families with
[SPEAKER_02]: better overall precision of selection,
which we think we can gain and also gain
[SPEAKER_02]: advantages of early selection by
developing genomic tools and developing
[SPEAKER_02]: marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what we're talking about is
whether we can pick a needle from a
[SPEAKER_02]: haystack, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether we can pick those particular
genotypes out of thousands that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: produce through breeding that have all of
the traits and additive genes combined in
[SPEAKER_02]: that one single superior genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish I could just look at the pots on
the greenhouse bench and pick out that one
[SPEAKER_02]: needle out of the haystack of seedlings,
but again, we can't do that by eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to develop genomic tools that can
do that for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very fortunate to collaborate
with folks at DOE, especially Jerry Tuscan
[SPEAKER_02]: at Oak Ridge National Lab, and relying on
his connections with the Joint Genome
[SPEAKER_02]: Institute of DOE, who have invested
resources to sequence salix purpurea as a
[SPEAKER_02]: reference for salix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we selected one of our female clones,
again, a central clone in our breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: program, did entirely Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was done at JGI.
[SPEAKER_02]: The assembly was done by Hai Bao Tang at
the Craig Venter Institute in Chris Town's
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we now have released that first
assembly in Phytosome version 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the DOE genomics website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're up to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a genome jockey, we're up to
scaffolds with an L50 of 190 KB,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we still have about 9,300 scaffolds in
our assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what that means is using this
short read Illumina technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have assembled the genome, but still
it's in a large number of small pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our ultimate aim is to assemble all of
those sequences into chromosome scale
[SPEAKER_02]: assemblies, but that is going to take some
additional sequencing work, which we are
[SPEAKER_02]: undertaking as we speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have been able to do is to take
advantage of this great technology
[SPEAKER_02]: developed in Ed Buckler's lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed is in the USDA down in Ithaca called
Genotyping by Sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This high resolution, high density marker
system can be developed without any prior
[SPEAKER_02]: genomic sequence knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very cheap per sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can get thousands of markers for
only $35 per sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were very lucky to get in early on
as Ed and Rob Elshire and Sharon Mitchell
[SPEAKER_02]: down in Ithaca were developing this
technique to develop GBS markers for Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: purpurea, which has now helped us in
developing a genetic map and improving our
[SPEAKER_02]: overall genome assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was to apply GBS to an F2
family, fairly large, 495 progeny of Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: purpurea, developed using our reference
genome 9406 as the original grandmother so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can develop, we produced in
collaboration with Steve DeFazio and Eli
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogers Melnik at West Virginia University,
a high resolution genetic map of this
[SPEAKER_02]: pedigree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could then take those GBS markers and
align them to our scaffolds in the
[SPEAKER_02]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And using the powers of the genetic
mapping could then assemble our scaffolds
[SPEAKER_02]: into chromosome scale pseudomolecule level
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have about 75 or 80% of the assembly
now aligned into these 19 pseudomolecules
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent to the 19 chromosomes of Salix.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm showing here in this figure is
the alignment of the Salix map to the
[SPEAKER_02]: poplar genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is the alignment of the Salix
sequence assembly scaffolds aligned to the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things that we've learned and we
continue to analyze the genome assembly is
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are some major chromosome
rearrangements between Salix and Populus.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big one here is between chromosome one
and 16, there's a fusion between Poplar
[SPEAKER_02]: and Salix.
[SPEAKER_02]: A major chunk of Poplar chromosome one is
fused with Salix chromosome 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also see some important translocations
and I'm going to tip my hand here and say
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have been mapping the sex
determination locus and actually that sex
[SPEAKER_02]: determination locus sits in a region that
is translocated from Poplar chromosome 19
[SPEAKER_02]: to Salix chromosome 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're learning some important
differences between Poplar and Willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having the genome assembly here,
there's a lot more analysis that we will
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: At JGI, they also sequenced some of the
expressed genes so that we could develop a
[SPEAKER_02]: high quality annotation of all of the
genes in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing RNA-seq from eight different tissue
libraries made from five different tissues
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what we see is that there are
slightly fewer genes expressed in Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: than there are in Poplar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still we have a pretty good library or
annotation of the 38,000 or so genes
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed in Willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step is to use that genetic map,
those GBS markers and the genome sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop mapping populations so that we
can relate phenotype to genotype so that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can start to work towards marker
assistant selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are using the complementary
approaches of both QTL mapping using
[SPEAKER_02]: bi-parental populations with association
mapping using a diverse collection of
[SPEAKER_02]: Salix purpurea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are now going back to that same F2
family which has a pretty large number of
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Craig Carlson here has planted that
out in a replicated trial here in JGI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we can start to characterize
traits of importance for biomass
[SPEAKER_02]: production, for Willow biology and map
them into this high resolution bi-parental
[SPEAKER_02]: mapping population.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that on some of the simple
traits already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since Willow is dioecious, we have been
able to map the locus controlling sex in
[SPEAKER_02]: Willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned before, it maps to a single
spot on chromosome 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we see that Salix purpurea
and perhaps all Salix are using a ZW sex
[SPEAKER_02]: determination system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that the female is the
heterogamedic sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male is ZZ while at least Populous
trichocarpa uses an XY sex determination
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, there are some interesting
contrasts there between Poplar and Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: and in the overall evolution of dioecious
and whether that XY and ZW system can
[SPEAKER_02]: flip-flop back and forth or at what point
in the divergence between Poplar and Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: did it flip-flop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one example of the types of
traits that we can map using this powerful
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Fred Gauker has been working to
develop association mapping or genome,
[SPEAKER_02]: a genome-wide association study or GWAS
using the collection of Salix purpurea
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have assembled from across the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have, it's a relatively small
association mapping population,
[SPEAKER_02]: only 112 genotypes, but we have planted
that on replicated trials here in Geneva
[SPEAKER_02]: out at the Clarel Station in Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in collaboration with Steve DeFazio
down in Morgantown, West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have fully genotyped that collection
with GBS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the last two years, Fred has been
working on phenotyping those populations
[SPEAKER_02]: with some of the key traits, again,
that we're interested in for biomass
[SPEAKER_02]: production, including, as you can imagine,
stem height, stem diameters, stem numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very interested in wood density.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use high resolution thermogravimetric
analysis to determine the composition of
[SPEAKER_02]: cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and ash
in the wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also been able to measure leaf
area, use a spad meter to measure leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen and a parameter to measure stem
model conductance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also developed some techniques to
look at overall crown form and growth
[SPEAKER_02]: form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also looking at pest and disease
resistance, which aren't on these,
[SPEAKER_02]: which isn't on this list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, some of the initial hits that Fred
has been able to map and he's actively
[SPEAKER_02]: working on mapping all of those traits
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, a simple one is to look at sex
determination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mapping in the association
population matches that that we see in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bi-parental QTL population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pointing to a single major locus on
chromosome 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that highlights how we can use these
two different mapping populations to
[SPEAKER_02]: complement one another and to confirm the
hits that we're getting in both types of
[SPEAKER_02]: mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other hits that Fred has come up with
here, we see a significant hit for
[SPEAKER_02]: variation in stem height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we look at these Manhattan plots,
each of these different colors represents
[SPEAKER_02]: the 19 different chromosomes in Salix and
each dot represents a snip or a marker on
[SPEAKER_02]: that chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it gets higher in this plot,
represents a higher level of significance
[SPEAKER_02]: for the correlation between variation in
that trait and that particular spot on the
[SPEAKER_02]: genome or snip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at hits for stem height here,
he has some snips that are significant and
[SPEAKER_02]: map to this very specific region of the
genome, which we can map using,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this was done with about 25,000
GBS markers, mapping those snips between a
[SPEAKER_02]: glycosyl hydrolase and a cellulase,
which we now need to follow up on and see
[SPEAKER_02]: how they are involved in regulating stem
height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another hit for hemicellulose content
quantified by TGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we see significant snips here in a
sugar nucleotide epimerase, potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: involved again in sugar nucleotide
conversions during cell wall biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this gives us some targets,
some candidate genes that we can follow up
[SPEAKER_02]: on, look at their patterns of expression,
look at the variation in alleles in our
[SPEAKER_02]: association population and to see how
those different alleles are influencing
[SPEAKER_02]: the traits involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so to summarize, we have a pretty
good genome assembly in place right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: produced through a good collaboration with
the Joint Genome Institute of DOE.
[SPEAKER_02]: We continue to advance those genomic
resources We have developed both QTL and
[SPEAKER_02]: association mapping populations that can
complement each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big issue, the most expensive part now
is phenotyping those populations with
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of plots out in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have great potential for
identifying good candidates for
[SPEAKER_02]: marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the final part of my talk is that I
think that Salix also represents a unique
[SPEAKER_02]: system for the study of heterosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that having these genomic resources
gives us the potential to probe some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the genomic basis for heterosis in this
highly heterozygous species which has
[SPEAKER_02]: undergone no domestication up to this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also displays heterosis across ploidy
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm gonna take you back to this
2008 selection trial, which had 75
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at the yield, the mean
yield of those 75 genotypes in that trial,
[SPEAKER_02]: and look at the ploidy, the vast majority
of the upper 50th percentile of genotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: in that trial were triploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the overall yield of the triploids was
significantly and dramatically greater
[SPEAKER_02]: than the yield of the diploids in that
trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yield of the tetraploids is not
significantly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we look at some of the other
traits like stem number or aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass composition, we do see significant
differences between the triploids and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom line here again is that we are
seeing dramatically better performance in
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids compared to diploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanna ask, what is the genomic basis
for that heterosis that we're capturing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to sort of define what we mean by
heterosis, the classic example is in
[SPEAKER_02]: maize, where if you cross one inbred line
with another inbred line, you see that the
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny display either mid-parent
heterosis, meaning that their mean
[SPEAKER_02]: performance is better than the average
performance of the two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you may see better parent heterosis,
meaning that the progeny are better than
[SPEAKER_02]: even the best, the better of the two
parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some classic models to
explain how that heterosis is occurring,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's occurring through a dominance
model or through an over dominance model.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dominance model meaning that there are
complimentary additive alleles which come
[SPEAKER_02]: together in the hybrid to make that hybrid
even better than its parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in the other model, the over dominance
model, where the presence of heterozygote
[SPEAKER_02]: even at a single gene can confer superior
performance to that hybrid over its two
[SPEAKER_02]: parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main difference being that in the
maize example, those are inbreds,
[SPEAKER_02]: highly homozygous inbred lines that have
been bred for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we're seeing heterosis when we cross
two wild accessions that are highly
[SPEAKER_02]: heterozygous and when we cross a diploid
with a tetraploid to get a triploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the approach that we're taking is to
look at the patterns of gene expression in
[SPEAKER_02]: the triploid progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to what extent is the inheritance of
gene expression in the hybrid progeny
[SPEAKER_02]: non-additive, meaning different from the
mid-parent average?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we identify allele-specific expression
inherited from one of the progeny or the
[SPEAKER_02]: other parents?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the obvious question would be,
is there a dosage effect in those triploid
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny that are getting two copies from
the tetraploid parent and one copy from
[SPEAKER_02]: the diploid parent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, are those differentially
expressed genes responsible for heterosis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So can we correlate the patterns of gene
expression that we see with phenotype in
[SPEAKER_02]: the field or in the greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we look at quantifying patterns of
gene expression, this is a scheme that we
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, sort of the default is when
gene expression equals, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: in parent one is equivalent to that in
parent two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, parent one will always be the
maternal parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when there's no differential expression
and the progeny gene expression is at that
[SPEAKER_02]: same level, we classify that as additive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not so interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more interesting case is when there is
differential gene expression between the
[SPEAKER_02]: two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, the mother has higher expression
than the father.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, the mother has lower expression than
the father.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the progeny expression hits the
midpoint between the parental levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: expression, again, we would call that
additive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the progeny expression is equivalent to
the high parent or the low parent,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that's an example of dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it is below the low parent or above
the high parent, again, that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: non-additive pattern of expression,
an example of under dominance or over
[SPEAKER_02]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the cases where we see differential
expression between our two parents,
[SPEAKER_02]: we will classify the expression in the
progeny according to these five
[SPEAKER_02]: categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to test, to look at differential
patterns of expression, we've developed
[SPEAKER_02]: these eight families.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, an F1 family of Salix
purpurea, that same F2 family of Salix
[SPEAKER_02]: purpurea that I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then reciprocal crosses between
purpurea and Viminalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, purpurea as the mother or Viminalis
as the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then triploid families representing
crosses between purpurea and myoviana or
[SPEAKER_02]: between Viminalis and myoviana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have planted typically 100 progeny
from each of these families in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the experiment that I'm going to
describe to you was done by selecting 10
[SPEAKER_02]: random progeny from six of these eight
families, growing those in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we extracted RNA to use for
RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We extracted tissue from, extracted RNA
from two different tissues, either from
[SPEAKER_02]: shoe tips or from stem internodes,
and mapped those reads back to our genome
[SPEAKER_02]: assembly, did statistics to look for
differential patterns of expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I don't have time to talk
about this today, but use some additional
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques to look at allele-specific
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to quickly go through some of the
main conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one being that triploids express
more genes than diploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at the total counts of
genes that are expressed in the triploid
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny, we see that there are thousands
of genes expressed, thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: additional genes expressed in the
triploids than in the diploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may be one clue right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, the overall levels of
expression tend to be lower in the progeny
[SPEAKER_02]: than they are in the parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we cluster the patterns of gene
expression, between progeny and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mid-parent values here, the first level of
clustering that we see is distinguishing
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny from those mid-parent values.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the greatest level of difference in
expression is between progeny and parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next level of clustering is at the
level of tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, sort of the bottom level of
clustering is at the level of species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting that the greatest
difference in the gene expression patterns
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're seeing are differences between
progeny and parents, even greater than
[SPEAKER_02]: differences between species.
[SPEAKER_02]: To put that another way, we see greater
differential gene expression between the
[SPEAKER_02]: mid-parent and the progeny than we see
between the two parents, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: different species, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, when we compare one parent to
another, male to female, you see that most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the dots are fairly close to the
one-to-one line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we compare progeny to mid-parent,
now we have a much broader scattering of
[SPEAKER_02]: spots representing greater differential
gene expression between progeny and
[SPEAKER_02]: parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the next thing was to quantify among
those genes which are differentially
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed between the two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So statistically, which genes for which
parent one is not equal to parent two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see here, the triploids and
the interspecific diploids have far more
[SPEAKER_02]: genes showing differential expression
between the two parents than our salix
[SPEAKER_02]: purpurea families.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of about 35,000 genes here,
as many as 7,000 genes are differentially
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed between the two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so now for those differentially
expressed genes, and they're more in the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot tip than there are in the internode.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those differentially expressed genes,
we fit them into those five categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they maternally dominant, paternally
dominant, over-dominant or under-dominant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they in that sort of default
additive case, where they hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: mid-parent mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing here is that
those genes that show additive expression
[SPEAKER_02]: are very, very few.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the vast majority are showing
highly maternal dominant patterns of
[SPEAKER_02]: expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that may be a clue to the
heterosis that we're seeing in species
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids in salix.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see more in shoot tip than we do in
internode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, what we want to go on to look at
is can we actually look at the allele
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from the mother and the expression
of the mother's allele compared to the
[SPEAKER_02]: father's allele?
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to identify SNPs or sequence
differences between those two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have now resequenced all of our
parents in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see quite a few differences,
SNPs that we can rely on to give us as
[SPEAKER_02]: many as 18,000 SNPs so we can start to
sort out allele-specific patterns of
[SPEAKER_02]: expression between mother and father.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to summarize this final experiment that
I described, there is greater differential
[SPEAKER_02]: gene expression in triploids than in our
salix purpurea diploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the gene expression levels in the
progeny show a strong pattern of maternal
[SPEAKER_02]: parent dominance, which is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step that we need to move on to
is to start to phenotype individuals in
[SPEAKER_02]: the field and in the greenhouse and
correlate the patterns of gene expression
[SPEAKER_02]: and perhaps expression of individual genes
that are differentially expressed with the
[SPEAKER_02]: heterotic phenotypes that we can quantify
in the greenhouse or in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all I have time to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to express my sincere thanks for
all the folks who have worked in my lab
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years, my three current Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: students, Fred, Eric, and Craig,
and Kurt, my technician, Michelle
[SPEAKER_02]: Serapilia, who was my graduate student and
then postdoc here in Geneva, who did a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of work to develop our methods of analysis
of wood composition, and my collaborators,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry Tuscan at Oak Ridge, Steve DeFazio
at West Virginia, Chris Town at Craig
[SPEAKER_02]: Venter Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned my collaborators at Michigan
State, Penn State, and SUNY ESF,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as all of the crews that we've had
here working with us in the summer,
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily here in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will stop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions,
including those from Ithaca, if you unmute
[SPEAKER_02]: your microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gennaro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think the different expression that
you see in the mother genome is related to
[SPEAKER_03]: the connection with the plastic genomes
that are inherited, and therefore,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the synthesis and everything else,
all the other machinery, do you think that
[SPEAKER_03]: is reasonable?
[SPEAKER_03]: That they communicate better because they
evolved together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to repeat Gennaro's question,
the question is whether the strong
[SPEAKER_02]: maternal dominance of expression that
we're seeing may be due to the influence
[SPEAKER_02]: of the chloroplast genome, which is
inherited from the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an excellent hypothesis
that we can test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Craig, I know, is very interested in
testing that hypothesis and has looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: the expression of chloroplast genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in our RNA-seq data.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question is whether there is
some epigenetic imprinting involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: this maternal dominant expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the maternal dominance, let me
reemphasize, does not matter which
[SPEAKER_02]: species, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether Salix feminalis is the mother
or Salix purpurea is the mother,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is maternal dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not species specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bruce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry, in some species, like potato,
when you make a cross between a tetraploid
[SPEAKER_05]: and a diploid, you get a pretty high
frequency of tetraploids due to un-reduced
[SPEAKER_05]: or diploid gametes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wondering, I hope your triploids,
what you've done to confirm that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: triploids, and I'm wondering whether
diploid gametes occur among Salix species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Bruce's question is, how detailed
have we gotten to confirm that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids?
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, we've only done flow
cytometry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done repeated flow cytometry because
that technique can be inconsistent from
[SPEAKER_02]: run to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not ruled out that there could be
different levels of aneuploidy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could go back and look
specifically through our GBS data to look
[SPEAKER_02]: for GBS markers that might indicate
aneuploidy of a particular chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, we do see un-reduced gametes in
Salix because sometimes we are able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny from our triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's probably the best evidence that
I can give you that there is some shaky
[SPEAKER_02]: control of chromosome number in the gamete
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you showed that there's some native
polyploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering, are those allo or are
these auto polyploid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's auto, again, that would be a
question related to what Bruce just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned earlier, the gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reduction, how that might complicate
the breeding system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know how detailed anyone has
characterized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is whether the polyploids
are allo or auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not aware of whether anyone has done
any detailed descriptions of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would assume that they are auto
polyploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas, and then maybe we should go to
David again.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so all that's for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said that having several genotypes
in a field is superior to a single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it strikes me if you say you had three
genotypes in a field and one of them got
[SPEAKER_01]: wiped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're in a field with only 2 thirds
of a crop, which can't possibly be
[SPEAKER_01]: economical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it better to just wipe out the whole
thing and start over if you get one of
[SPEAKER_01]: your genotypes with a fatal flaw?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so if you have picked the one best
yielding cultivar and have planted all of
[SPEAKER_02]: your fields with that one and it gets
wiped out, then you have no yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have planted three and you've
planted them in blocks, or maybe this
[SPEAKER_02]: field in one, this field in another,
then yeah, your one field is wiped out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can replant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that one block is wiped out,
you can replant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The standard in Ireland now and in
England, I think, is to plant in random
[SPEAKER_02]: mixtures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, the superior genotypes win
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rust susceptible genotypes diminish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you end up with a lower number of
plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we found is that that does not
severely impact overall yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much percent?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can go down probably 30
percent in stand density and still realize
[SPEAKER_02]: comparable yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions from Ithaca?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you indicated that there are going to
be seven harvests commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question is, is any
fertilizer put on that at all because
[SPEAKER_04]: you're removing a lot of nutrients from
the soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a corollary of that, it would seem
to me that over the long term,
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant's ability to take up nutrients
would be a considerable factor in the
[SPEAKER_04]: total yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you never mentioned that, at least I
don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to know whether there's any
plans to look at your progeny for the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to take up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the aspects of our
research that I had to drop out from this
[SPEAKER_02]: seminar, but is the main topic of Eric
Fabio's research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he has done fertilizer trials using
some of our current commercial cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: in the greenhouse, has been looking at the
impact of nutrients, nutrient management
[SPEAKER_02]: by cover crops on early establishment of
willows in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, has been analyzing yields from
across now 24 different trials to
[SPEAKER_02]: correlate soil nutrient levels with yield
and growth parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are conflicting data in the
literature, some papers which say there's
[SPEAKER_02]: very little influence of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that there is an influence of
fertilizer, especially in the early
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest cycles, but that it seems fairly
likely that after a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: time, a cycling of nutrients will be
established in willow plantations so that
[SPEAKER_02]: long term fertilizer application may not
be necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's other questions we have
here.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jay is asking if willows are
mycorrhizal and yes they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're rather promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can form associations with multiple
different types of categorizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, ties in with the need for
fertilizer, but it's one that needs a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have used both pseudo test cross
male parent back cross markers and female
[SPEAKER_02]: parent back cross markers as well as
intercross markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in that initial analysis,
we had about 8,300 markers and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: about 3,300 of them were intercross
markers and something like 22,000 or 2200
[SPEAKER_02]: were pseudo test cross markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
