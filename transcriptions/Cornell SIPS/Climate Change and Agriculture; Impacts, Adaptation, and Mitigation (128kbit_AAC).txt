[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today begins our focus on horticulture
and a changing climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the best person to introduce
this topic to us is in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's David Wolf from our own
department of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: David gave me this nice bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to get a few snippets from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like many of us faculty in the room,
David did his graduate work at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of California Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's currently professor of plant and soil
ecology in the department of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is co-chair of the New York State soil
health program work team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1990, he's been a leading authority
on climate change impacts on crop soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and ecosystems with lots of peer-reviewed
publications and book chapters and reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: and all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, he was the lead author for the
agriculture chapter of the Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate Change Impact Assessment released
July 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the author of the award-winning
popular science book on soil ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tales from the Underground, a Natural
History of Subterranean Life, published in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to welcome David up
to the podium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's great to talk to all of you
about this topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Neil and I discussed a little bit what
I could cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's over the years I have done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Various angles of research on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could have dug deep on some of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I felt it was best for me to kind of
give an introductory broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion of some of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be touching a little bit on some new
work that will be publicly released in
[SPEAKER_04]: early November.
[SPEAKER_04]: The New York State funded projects looking
at vulnerabilities and adaptation
[SPEAKER_04]: strategies for agriculture and for
ecosystems in New York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funded by NYSERDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite a number of people at Cornell
besides myself and Dr. Comstock is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll coordinate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give a few tidbits of some of that
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a number of websites on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come back to them, I think,
in my final slide and go through some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my mouse or my?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have to pull it forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, you'll be hearing, I think,
a little later in the term from Art
[SPEAKER_04]: Degutano, the climate scientist here at
Cornell, who I've worked closely with over
[SPEAKER_04]: the years on all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll give you a lot of details about
climate change science.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought to start our session,
I'll talk a little bit about climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change and the natural science of changing
climate per se and put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a trace going back, if you can see
from the back of the room, 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bottom is the temperature trace,
looking at these.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can see these dips in temperature and
rise in temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the interglacial periods.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take place over tens of thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got that going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see reasonably well correlated
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have, with the change in
temperatures, two key greenhouse gases
[SPEAKER_04]: going up and down, methane and carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, this is all going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well before humans were very important on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right about here is where human
agriculture started, to put this in
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective, way over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, the climate's always been
changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humans aren't the only one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's trying to say humans are the only
ones causing climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this is due, and Art may get into
some of this with you, to planetary
[SPEAKER_04]: shifts, minor shifts in the Earth's axis,
sun activity, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of this work is that scientists
have understood for some time some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: driving forces of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly, the greenhouse gases are
part of this whole story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what I'm going to show you in the next
graph, it's got the same thing on the
[SPEAKER_04]: x-axis going down 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to show just the CO2 trace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll replace some of that, and then we're
going to see where CO2's going,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, to kind of put things in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the y-axis is quite different,
but here's that CO2 trace we saw in the
[SPEAKER_04]: last graph, going back 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a different y-axis scale,
so it's all shrunk down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see we go back almost half a
million years.
[SPEAKER_04]: CO2 never really gets above 280 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_04]: CO2's going up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, even before humans were on the
planet, it's going up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right about here, humans are on the
planet, and they start affecting things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess somewhere right about there
was when I was in grad school,
[SPEAKER_04]: and CO2 was about 330 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up at 390 parts per million now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see we are already,
and this is actually a little out of date.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be up a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are already, due to human activities,
fossil fuel burning and other things,
[SPEAKER_04]: moving the CO2 levels beyond what we've
seen for the past 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the projections for the future
look like this, based on current rates of
[SPEAKER_04]: fossil fuel emissions, and based on the
best estimates that scientists have.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have kind of two scenarios that I'm
going to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first scenario is that CO2 levels are
typically depicted.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lower scenario would be one of if
within the next decade or two,
[SPEAKER_04]: society gets, really moves quickly away
from energy products that release CO2 or
[SPEAKER_04]: other greenhouse gases, and we get really
clean energy and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't do much and just wait and see
what happens, we're on that kind of trace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, the CO2 levels, all these
fluctuations we saw before, they're
[SPEAKER_04]: correlation with temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see why this kind of spooks us
a little bit, thinking about CO2 getting
[SPEAKER_04]: this far out of whack.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just to put it in perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something that will be a little
more familiar to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant hardiness zone maps, these
color-coded maps.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: on the left there, 1990 USDA's last map.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color codes refer to the coldest it
gets in the winter, minimum winter
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at garden centers, and farmers are
aware of this sort of thing, the minimum
[SPEAKER_04]: winter temperatures determine what kind of
ornamentals you might put in your garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind also, minimum winter
temperatures are very crucial to,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, the habitable range of insect
and insect pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where crops we might grow,
different places where weed species will
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the 1990 map.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has always been based on the last 15
years of weather records.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very pretty, laborious,
but very straightforward procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at all the NOAA weather stations,
all the weather stations, same stuff we
[SPEAKER_04]: get our weather reports from on the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the evening, you go back the last 15
years and you look at the minimum winter
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures and develop these codes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Redone in 2006, they gave it from the back
of the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see no matter where you live in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some very dramatic change in
minimum winter temperatures in just that
[SPEAKER_04]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost no matter where you live,
we're in a different hardiness zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a project with the New York
Botanic Garden in the Bronx, New York
[SPEAKER_04]: where a few years ago they put in a test
garden of all some ornamentals that are
[SPEAKER_04]: really one hardiness zone warmer than the
old map.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those things are still doing okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the key thing there to kind of
put it a little bit, something a little
[SPEAKER_04]: more familiar for you in terms of what's
happening in the climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This pace of change is really not
something way beyond what we've seen in
[SPEAKER_04]: the last half million, million,
two million years on this planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is much faster than the typical,
like what I was showing you on those
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier graphs, the interglacial periods.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've seen here in the last 15,
20 years typically would take more like
[SPEAKER_04]: 500 years, 1,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one question is, what species will
be able to keep up with this in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: moving around to stay in their ideal zone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting even closer to home, this is some
information on the Northeast in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing we noticed in the Northeast
is that while we're experiencing warming
[SPEAKER_04]: just like the global warming is happening,
our warming rate on an annual basis is
[SPEAKER_04]: slightly faster than the average global
annual warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in particular, our winters are warming
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're warming more than our summers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so winter temperatures here in the
Northeast have gone up over four degrees
[SPEAKER_04]: Fahrenheit on average across the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just different color dots,
different size dots into creating how much
[SPEAKER_04]: increase there's been from this period.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was an evaluation from 1970 to 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the key thing is to see,
no matter where you look on this map,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's nowhere showing a decrease in
temperature or a stabilization of
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everywhere there's an increase in winter
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a matter of how much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock in
exactly where you live because there are
[SPEAKER_04]: some issues with certain weather stations,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty, you know, just adds to
the evidence that not just even we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be getting into climate models in
the future, but just what's really
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in our recent history.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some pretty dramatic changes happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what really fascinates me and
what really has dug me even deeper into
[SPEAKER_04]: this whole issue as an ecologist,
a plant scientist, recognizing that plant
[SPEAKER_04]: science can be looked at as very sensitive
weather instruments, you might say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these living things like plants are
also responding to the climate change
[SPEAKER_04]: we've already been experiencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, Radia talking about trying to
predict the future of climate models you
[SPEAKER_04]: might not trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just talking about what's been happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so myself and Adalaxo, a number of
other people a few years ago, dug up some
[SPEAKER_04]: historical records of bloom dates of
apples, grapes, and lilacs throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: Northeast and documented that all three of
these perennial fruit crops in our region
[SPEAKER_04]: are indeed blooming earlier than they did
previously by as much as a week or more,
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on the particular species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and these are just things we have
records for.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also seeing changes in arrivals of
butterflies and insect arrivals and bird
[SPEAKER_04]: arrivals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I won't take the time to go
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a number of peer-reviewed
papers besides ours documenting other
[SPEAKER_04]: things more or less in our region,
more indicators of the living world
[SPEAKER_04]: already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Responding to the change we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Arnold Arboretum showing earlier
bloom dates as well, wildflowers in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington, D.C., earlier arrival of
migrant birds in New York, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people say they don't believe in
climate change, I have this evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not sure where they're coming
from on all that because it seems to me
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's fairly, it comes in from all
sorts of angles in terms of evidence that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's already happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could say you're not sure what
the causes are, but certainly something's
[SPEAKER_04]: changing out there fairly rapidly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, talking about the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Neil mentioned briefly this Northeast
Climate Impacts Assessment I was involved
[SPEAKER_04]: with some years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we had our whole team of climate
modelers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won't go into the details and get
into this more with you later in the term.
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole ensemble of the latest and
greatest GCNs, Global Circulation Models.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also regionally downscaled these to
our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Came up with the best estimates they could
on what the future holds for our area,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just looking at the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to just go to sort of the extreme end
of things, looking at the end of the
[SPEAKER_04]: century.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, sort of assuming two scenarios here
because the most difficult thing in
[SPEAKER_04]: predicting the climate in the future is
not so much the physics of the climate
[SPEAKER_04]: models, but what is society going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to go on this lower emissions
path?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to move away?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are we going to kind of do this
business as usual thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see even if you go on a lower
emissions pathway due to lags in the
[SPEAKER_04]: system and a lot of details that have to
do with how the climate responds to
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse gases and such, we're looking
at a few to several degrees continued
[SPEAKER_04]: warming by end of the century.
[SPEAKER_04]: And worst case, business as usual,
we kind of just move along like we are now
[SPEAKER_04]: and not pay much attention to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have as much as 7 to 11 or 12
degrees per night warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: To put that in perspective, this higher
emissions scenario thing for 100 years
[SPEAKER_04]: from now or less, that amount of
temperature change, well like where we're
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting right now about 15,000 years ago
was all under a glacial ice sheet,
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of feet thick in some places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the temperature was about 12,
11 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it is
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the course of 15,000 years,
it's warmed and we've got what we've got
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're talking about in 100 years,
let's double down on that and see what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: With our winter temperatures in our
region, there's all kinds of little
[SPEAKER_04]: nuances and I'm just going to give you a
couple, again just in sort of this broad
[SPEAKER_04]: overview introductory talk, one that sort
of intrigued me and then has to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: the effect of warmer winters has on snow
cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this then affects albedo, the
reflectivity of the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more snow you have, the less warming
that goes on during the winter because a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of that light is reflected back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have warmer temperatures,
it feeds on itself because you have less
[SPEAKER_04]: snow cover, fewer snow cover days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets warmer and warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snow melts more and basically that's why
our winters are warmer than our summers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the high latitude regions on
the planet are warmer, warming warmer than
[SPEAKER_04]: the mid-latitude regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: This graphic on the left is the red
outline of the northeast there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That map shows the historical,
looking at historical records.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was from 1961 to 1990.
[SPEAKER_04]: The region of the northeast where you had
at least 30 days of snow cover in the
[SPEAKER_04]: winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the white area here, the much
smaller white area, is what's projected
[SPEAKER_04]: for end of century, how much of our region
will actually see a minimum of 30 days of
[SPEAKER_04]: snow cover by end of century and with the
business as usual scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a big difference in snow cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of think of snow as cold,
but also of course it's a big insulating
[SPEAKER_04]: blanket in the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of species are dependent on that
insulation for their winter survival.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of microbial activity actually
stay, keeps going during the winter
[SPEAKER_04]: because just below a snow blanket,
temperatures hover around freezing and you
[SPEAKER_04]: can still have a lot of nitrogen
mineralization and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you may have been here long enough
to know Justin Rich, a recent graduate
[SPEAKER_04]: student of mine, who had the kind of tough
project of having snow removal plots
[SPEAKER_04]: versus no snow removal plots, a lot of
snow shoveling all winter to look at what
[SPEAKER_04]: fewer snow cover days would mean for some
microbial community structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in particular, looking at the nitrogen
cycle in soils over the winter and found
[SPEAKER_04]: that, make a long story short,
there was more nitrate leaching from soils
[SPEAKER_04]: with lower snow cover because of less
smaller microbial biomass in the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of other interesting things which I
don't really have time to get into,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it affects denitrification rates,
spring thawed nitrate losses,
[SPEAKER_04]: overwintering of pathogens and beneficial
nematodes, spring weed seed termination,
[SPEAKER_04]: all those things affected just by the snow
cover issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of this climate business that's
happening and is projected to happen,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more than I have time to go into,
but the impacts are going to be our
[SPEAKER_04]: ecosystems are really undoubtedly going to
be doing some kind of level of disassembly
[SPEAKER_04]: coming apart in some ways, some species
benefiting from the change, some not,
[SPEAKER_04]: some dying off, some dispersing to other
regions, and then reassembling in new
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really, I don't think, we've just
had this major project looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: ecosystems and some of the best ecologists
here at Cornell and throughout the state
[SPEAKER_04]: working with us, and nobody can really
predict exactly what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: The maps on the left here are just showing
what could happen to some of our main
[SPEAKER_04]: major tree species groups, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is based on a very simple
analysis, just looking at how the basic
[SPEAKER_04]: climate is going to change and how that's
going to affect the habitable zone of
[SPEAKER_04]: different tree species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the habitable zone for certain tree
species is no longer optimum, it will be
[SPEAKER_04]: disappearing again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this color code for the northeast and
the upper left here, you'll see a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's maple beach birch, our maple beach
birch forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look, jump down all the way to
the far end of the end of the century,
[SPEAKER_04]: business as usual scenario, you'll see
very little gold in New York State,
[SPEAKER_04]: very little maple beach birch.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, the maple beach birch tree
communities could potentially disappear
[SPEAKER_04]: from our region or begin to be
significantly negatively affected in any
[SPEAKER_04]: way by the climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they really disappear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they really, this is projecting that
they would be replaced by oak hickory pine
[SPEAKER_04]: type forests.
[SPEAKER_04]: But will the seeds of the oak hickory pine
get up here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, let's just take the oak story
as one little interesting case.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that deer are likely to
benefit a lot from climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it winters, less snow cover,
they can eat more vegetation in the
[SPEAKER_04]: winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of various trees, seedlings,
what they like to eat a lot is oak.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while the oaks could benefit in terms
of climate, they can be fed on more by the
[SPEAKER_04]: deer that are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is one example of how complicated
it is to predict our future.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of what we're going to be
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives us all, I guess, some work to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't spend too much time on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some specific species,
some that are tree species likely to lose
[SPEAKER_04]: suitable habitat, gain suitable habitat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, there could be a lot of other
confounding factors that affect this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of details that I wouldn't
have time to go into.
[SPEAKER_04]: A thing that concerns anybody who thinks
about the interaction between species,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ecology of all of that, is one thing
we know for certain is there's no two
[SPEAKER_04]: species out there that are going to
respond exactly the same to climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like probably no two humans are going
to respond exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us are going to like what changes
are happening and some might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could affect species interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we have this change in climate
zones, we also know with great certainty
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're not going to have entire
complex ecosystems, multiple species
[SPEAKER_04]: moving in mass together, staying
coordinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a lot of a rupture of
those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how might that mess up things like
plants and pollinators, plants are
[SPEAKER_04]: blooming earlier, pollinators be there,
natural enemies and pests, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we have, there's really a lot of
room for a lot of research, minimal
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence of major disruptions at this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some redundancy in our ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a big question mark there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But something that we, I think,
most feel is going to be an issue here and
[SPEAKER_04]: there of how this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let me move onto agriculture,
which I'll tend to focus on more
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically in the rest of the talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you talk to home gardeners or
farmers about longer growing seasons and
[SPEAKER_04]: warmer temperatures, their eyes can light
up and think, well, I can grow camellias
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't grow them before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can grow better watermelons.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do a better job with red wine
grapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, there's certainly a truth to
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And compared to some parts of the world,
we will, I think, in our region,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's certainly a possibility that we'll
have some real opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here at Cornell, we're all about
working with farmers to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_04]: these opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the tricky thing for farmers is
going to be not jumping the gun on these
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where I think people at
Cornell can help.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, someone like a climate
scientist, providing more than just
[SPEAKER_04]: anecdotal information about whether trends
are sort of part of a real climate change
[SPEAKER_04]: phenomenon or just the flu.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're very much about helping farmers
decide if they want to start making some
[SPEAKER_04]: changes or gardens as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a downside to our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look south of here, you look at the
wheat pressure south of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We look at the insect pressure,
the disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much greater than we have here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet corn growers in a place like Florida
or Georgia can spray 15 times a year for
[SPEAKER_04]: some lepidopter pests, where in some years
we may get away with just a couple sprays
[SPEAKER_04]: here, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pesticide loads could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Summer heat stress, while warmer
temperatures in the summer could benefit
[SPEAKER_04]: some crops, we will certainly have more
heat stress days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll talk a little bit more about
water management.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have sort of a situation here
where we have both too much and too little
[SPEAKER_04]: water.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of have climate projections
indicate perhaps both sides of that coin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to take a specific example,
for the New York Finger Lakes region and
[SPEAKER_04]: the wine grape, the vinipro wine grape
industry that's, as we all know,
[SPEAKER_04]: been growing by leaps and bounds since the
1970s or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just coincidence really, I think,
or fortuitously for many of those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been moving into this warming phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of those European grapes that
are not native to our region, they can
[SPEAKER_04]: suffer pretty severe damage at minus 12
Fahrenheit or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to have more winters with those
really low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had fewer since that industry's been
expanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so really I think, and the projections
are that we should see continuation of
[SPEAKER_04]: that phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that industry is an industry
where there could be some potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: But oddly, something we've been seeing
lately is more freeze damage in some of
[SPEAKER_04]: our vinipro plantings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in years when we've had warmer
winters.
[SPEAKER_04]: By warmer winters, I mean if we take the
average December plus January plus
[SPEAKER_04]: February temperature, we can have a winter
like that where the average of those three
[SPEAKER_04]: months of the winter is warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can still have more freeze damage
than we've seen previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this can kind of come in two,
it can happen from two angles.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is you can have an unusually warm
December, which helps your average winter
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the plants don't harden properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe they started to harden in
November, and then they come out of this
[SPEAKER_04]: hardening process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have a normal January,
and they get hard hit by freeze,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what we saw in a couple of years,
2003, 2004, literally millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_04]: of damage in the thing of legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also have premature leaf out in
the spring, the other end of winter,
[SPEAKER_04]: not early winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But things like degree day accumulation
happening, you get leaf out early,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's the damage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you might say, you know,
speculative, but I imagine we will sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: gradually, as the century goes on,
grow out of this problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, it's a very serious
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, some other regions have more,
you know, you have to think about what's
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in the rest of the country and
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: In California, they've got even more
serious concerns, I think, about their
[SPEAKER_04]: food industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Napa Valley, so famous for its wine
quality, summer heat stress, the
[SPEAKER_04]: projections there look very bad for
maintaining that same level of quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And later in this term, we're going to
have Ray Jones, who's going to talk to us
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a bit about the grape and wine
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you want to miss that one,
it should be interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing, it's a bigger issue in
California than it is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: As most of you in this room would know,
pretty old food crops actually need some
[SPEAKER_04]: cold temperatures in winter in order to be
hormonally primed in the spring,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might say, to flower properly and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a chill hour requirement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperatures roughly have to stay below
about 45 degrees Fahrenheit for so many
[SPEAKER_04]: days, hours, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this graphic just shows that in
different parts of California,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to be a problem for a lot of
food crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not a big problem for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some of our, late in the century,
we might have some problem with some of
[SPEAKER_04]: our apple varieties that have very long
winter chill requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperatures really get warm in the
winter, but more of an issue for
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that will hit us though,
as I mentioned already, is warmer winters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter is going to mean more overwintering
survival of largely overwintering insect
[SPEAKER_04]: pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have more generations in the
summer season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Northward expansion of their range,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Invasive weed species, kudzu, and if
you're from the south, you'll be familiar
[SPEAKER_04]: with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very notorious invasive weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Its range is very much dictated by the
minimum winter temperatures, and those are
[SPEAKER_04]: going up in our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the corn earworm is an interesting
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, already we're kind of seeing some
adaptation, you might say, of agriculture
[SPEAKER_04]: in New York to climate change,
where our IPM scouts are having to set out
[SPEAKER_04]: a fair amount of traps to look for
activity of corn earworm earlier than they
[SPEAKER_04]: ever did before, and already sort of
adapting to that being more of a test.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flea beetle is a vector of Stewart's
wheel, a big problem in corn, and is a
[SPEAKER_04]: marginally overwintering insect,
and becoming more of an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a graphic.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is showing the spread of the kudzu
range, for example, into the northeast,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the top panel is looking at the
business-as-usual emission scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, comparing these scenarios of fossil
fuel emissions versus the lower emissions
[SPEAKER_04]: on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Early century to the end of the century.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is kudzu coming to get us?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see it's marching up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There would be some difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lower emission scenario would be much
less problematic for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: While I'm speaking of weeds and kudzu,
another interesting phenomenon about weeds
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it turns out that fast-growing
species in general, such as our weeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to benefit more from the direct
effect of just the higher carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_04]: in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose many of you are familiar with
this so-called CO2 fertilization effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants take up CO2 for photosynthesis to
produce sugars to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most of our so-called C3 plants,
with C3 photosynthetic pathway in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular, have the potential to get some
boost from higher CO2 in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_04]: irrespective of climate change,
just looking at that effect alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is actually how I first got into
the climate change research realm back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the late 80s, early 90s, was looking
specifically at the CO2 effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: The species that tend to take the most
advantage of this and get the most benefit
[SPEAKER_04]: are plants that can, to put it in simple
terms, find a place to put the new sugars
[SPEAKER_04]: they're producing, the extra sugars,
more quickly than they get feedback
[SPEAKER_04]: effects starting to slow down their
photosynthetic capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have this kind of downward
photosynthetic acclimation to high CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: phenomena for plants that don't have the
sink capacity for the new sugars they're
[SPEAKER_04]: producing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that fast-growing weeds
really benefit a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Canadian thistle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do they benefit more,
but my colleague Lou Ziska has done a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of work with weeds and CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's documented for a lot of weed species
that it takes more, they're more resistant
[SPEAKER_04]: to herbicide control.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is showing an experiment with
Canadian thistle grown at today's CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: levels versus CO2 levels expected by mid
to late century.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same level of glyphosate ground up sprayed
on both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had to go to two to three times the
recommended rate of glyphosate to get
[SPEAKER_04]: similar glyphosate control.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how will farmers adapt to, gardeners
adapt to this phenomenon of climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change?
[SPEAKER_04]: Spray more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spray more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our kind of a conundrum and a
major issue that we're trying to learn
[SPEAKER_04]: policy makers to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working both with the DEC and active
markets on trying to get everybody sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: poised about climate change issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't be tying the hands of farmers for
adapting to climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, we have to be proactive
about this sort of thing, and perhaps be
[SPEAKER_04]: proactive about developing alternatives to
chemicals for weeds we see coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be more of a problem, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Summer heat stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even for a crop like tomatoes,
which currently is really, you could
[SPEAKER_04]: argue, marginally adapted to our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had some important tomato
processing industry in some years in the
[SPEAKER_04]: past.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not perfectly suited to our
region.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should benefit some from warmer
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even tomatoes, you get some high
temperature stress during reproductive
[SPEAKER_04]: phase, and you can have terrible effects
on quality, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no question any of the climate
model projections you look at for our
[SPEAKER_04]: region, we will have increased frequency
of the number of days that exceed high
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature thresholds for crops like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're particularly concerned about the
dairy industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that dairy cows, if you don't
mind my debating a bit from horticulture
[SPEAKER_04]: here, and I had to learn this from my
animal scientist colleague, Larry Chase.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's worked with us for years on climate
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dairy cows really like it cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 40 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit,
that's peak milk production for dairy
[SPEAKER_04]: cows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had, although our dairy industry
has a lot of challenges, this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to have dairy farms with a
lot of fancy cooling equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cows can really work at their peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly, this just shows some model
projections showing milk production
[SPEAKER_04]: decline in the future for the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless farmers do some fairly
straightforward adaptations, improving the
[SPEAKER_04]: ventilation system of their dairy barns,
and putting in more fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this is a capital cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one question we have is, will the
farmers have that capital to make that
[SPEAKER_04]: transition?
[SPEAKER_04]: As many of you know, a lot of the dairy
industry is the farmers are right at the
[SPEAKER_04]: edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they might just as soon sell out and
have to come up with that kind of capital
[SPEAKER_04]: to make that kind of adjustment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, there could be people from
another region, a warmer part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: country, who look at this as an
opportunity and buy up some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: dairies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could exacerbate the already
consolidation we're seeing in the dairy
[SPEAKER_04]: industry here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is showing some details of the
projections for the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature on the top graph and rainfall
on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a little more detail that I
really need to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's showing a few different climate
emissions scenarios and different times in
[SPEAKER_04]: the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really want you to just look at is
looking at, if we look at temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see whether we look at the annual
temperature, the winter temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: the summer temperature, no matter what
model we're looking at or emissions
[SPEAKER_04]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got this general temperature
increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: With precipitation, it's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess the good news, let's start
with the good news, the annual
[SPEAKER_04]: precipitation for our region is not
projected to decline dramatically like we
[SPEAKER_04]: see for other parts of the world,
sub-Saharan Africa or even parts of the
[SPEAKER_04]: western U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Precipitation is harder for modelers to
predict, so the data is a little more,
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger error bars often, and a little
harder to predict.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you might say, looking at the data
overall, that precipitation might stay
[SPEAKER_04]: constant for our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might go up a little, it might go down
a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the increase that we do see is likely
to come in winter and probably winter
[SPEAKER_04]: rainfall, not snowfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very little change in summer rainfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very little change at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about the same, some variability,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we have warmer temperatures in the
summer and the exact same rainfall,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's that going to do to crop
evapotranspiration and crop water needs?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to need more water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have a compensatory increase
in rainfall really to keep up with the
[SPEAKER_04]: warmer temperatures and increase the
effort to not have increased water
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even while we're not projecting extreme
droughts, the end of agriculture in New
[SPEAKER_04]: York because of drought, I think there's
going to be more challenges, more need for
[SPEAKER_04]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a couple other slides to go into
a little more detail about the irrigation
[SPEAKER_04]: story for our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, this is showing, just to inform you
that even today, we kind of think of New
[SPEAKER_04]: York as having rainfall, enough rainfall
for summer crop reduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, in some parts, particularly,
this is looking at Rochester, which is one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the drier parts of the state,
but also a very important vegetable
[SPEAKER_04]: production area, for example, a food crop
production area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at it, this is historical records.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that in these months here,
month 6, 7, 8, we're referring to the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is potential evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is assuming full canopy cover,
too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't really modified this for birdie
crop growth, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the maximum potential
evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall in
[SPEAKER_04]: the summer in our region.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, to grow optimum crops in
Rochester, New York in an average year,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might be able to rely to take care of
some of this gap with water holding
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably you'll need supplementary
irrigation in a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what our models project for the future
is that that's just going to become more
[SPEAKER_04]: dramatic, of course, and irrigation
requirements are going to go up,
[SPEAKER_04]: because this is going to go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Precipitation is projected to stay about
the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: This graphic is a little tricky,
and I'll point out just a couple things to
[SPEAKER_04]: give you the key points.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is looking at, trying to look into
the future, and looking at B1 and A2.
[SPEAKER_04]: We refer to the two different emissions
scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is looking later and later into
the century.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, again, focused on Rochester,
New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just showing you historic data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is doing an analysis for the
historic data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's looking at, this color code
refers to how much of a summer water
[SPEAKER_04]: deficit we can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can see that if you look at this
blue code down in the bottom here,
[SPEAKER_04]: about 1 in 10 years, we have absolutely no
deficit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plenty of water for the season,
historically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about 10% of the years, we have pretty
severe deficits where if you don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: irrigation, there's probably no way you're
going to have a good crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you just look at this teal blue
color at the top here, you can see that,
[SPEAKER_04]: as you might expect, expanding more and
more of the years, more frequency,
[SPEAKER_04]: more chances of this kind of severe
deficit summer as we go into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of a worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing future analyses looking at
some other PET models.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, this is assuming full canopy
cover for the whole summer, which is kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of a worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's more just comparing the
historical to projected to give you an
[SPEAKER_04]: idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think without question, one thing you
can say with confidence is that irrigation
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements will go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, we have a current trend
for increased frequency of high rainfall
[SPEAKER_04]: events.
[SPEAKER_04]: More of our rain in the northeast in the
past 30 years or so is coming down
[SPEAKER_04]: packaged in rainfall like one to two
inches in 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's projected to continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So more flooding is projected for our
regions, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: More increased frequency of flooding
events.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get it from both angles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the challenge for farmers is,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had flooding the last three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a permanent phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I invest $10,000 in a new drainage
system?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or wait, no, they're telling me drought's
going to be happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: When should I invest in the irrigation
system?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they were doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were trying to make a decision that
they really had to make personally based
[SPEAKER_04]: on their own economics and their own farm,
their own personal level of risk that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're willing to take, and that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So adaptation, I've kind of alluded to
some of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of things farmers can do
to deal with climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: From fairly simple ones, the most common
ones, the most common ones, the most
[SPEAKER_04]: common ones, new crops, new varieties,
have more diversified farms, earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: planting dates with earlier springs,
changes in pruning strategies,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously more better wheat and pest
monitoring as we have new pests coming up,
[SPEAKER_04]: increased irrigation, improving drainage,
animal facilities improve the cooling
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, for example, a dairy barn being
built today, that's a big long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a 50 to 100 year investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should not be built on the specs of the
old historical climate that we know is not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be here in the century when that
barn is going to sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of thing is how farmers kind of
adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have this issue of equity concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, will small family farmers have
that little bit of capital it might take
[SPEAKER_04]: to make the adaptation that could keep
them in business or even open up an
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity for them?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they might not have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also having just access to the right
information for the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: In all of these climate change
assessments, there's sort of these three
[SPEAKER_04]: components that we think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a climate factor like drought or
heat stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got an impact, reduced yields or
milk production decline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then an adaptation, new irrigation
equipment, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of these, we don't have certainty
about any of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the climate factors,
we're used to the climate scientists
[SPEAKER_04]: usually provide their information with
different levels of certainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they say, well, with the temperature
projections, we have a pretty high degree
[SPEAKER_04]: of certainty about that precipitation,
lower level of certainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also have different levels of
certainty about the impacts and then our
[SPEAKER_04]: adaptation capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to keep those things in mind as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some impacts are very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't water a crop and it doesn't
get any water, it's not going to do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are much more subtle and complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: CO2 affects interactions with
environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these things that I mentioned are
happening now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, it's urgent.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to respond, we need to be
adapting now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are projections that are late in the
century.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I mentioned, maybe winter chilling
requirements of some long winter chill
[SPEAKER_04]: requirement apple varieties by end of
century might be getting on the edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a later term thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those kinds of things have to be kept
in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sometimes we have a very
straightforward adaptation strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's either not the money to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The farmers don't have the money,
or we don't have the information to do it
[SPEAKER_04]: well, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to think about all of these
things in poising the farmers that we work
[SPEAKER_04]: with to be prepared for this, the state
policymakers, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, in my few minutes of meeting,
I'm going to turn a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: attention to the other side of the coin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is not adaptation and how farmers
might adapt to climate change,
[SPEAKER_04]: but mitigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might say becoming part of the
solution, reducing greenhouse gases on the
[SPEAKER_04]: farm, and the role that I play in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a laundry list of some
fundamental things that can be done on the
[SPEAKER_04]: farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these are the same kind of things
we can do in our personal lives,
[SPEAKER_04]: and reducing fossil fuel use, et cetera,
using more renewable energy, fuel crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Minority handling and storage is a big
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll mention some of these in a little
more detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency,
I'll explain why that would be a big one
[SPEAKER_04]: up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then soil carbon sequestration,
some of you are quite familiar with what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to talk about a few of these
issues of the other side of the coin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll hear, I think, a little bit more
about this later in the term as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the other speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a lot of farmers looking into
this because it makes plenty of economic
[SPEAKER_04]: sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wind turbines on marginal parts of the
property to supplement their own energy
[SPEAKER_04]: needs as energy costs go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers exploring biofuel crops either to
support their own needs or to get into the
[SPEAKER_04]: biofuel markets that are opening up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while there's a lot of, obviously you
have a whole seminar series about biofuel
[SPEAKER_04]: crops and that makes a lot of
controversies and issues, there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: question that compared to bringing new
carbon from deep in the earth and getting
[SPEAKER_04]: it up to the surface and then burning it
off and now it's part of our surface
[SPEAKER_04]: system for the long term, there's a lot of
advantages to working with and recycling
[SPEAKER_04]: of carbon to plants, burning the carbon
from the plants, but then having the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: suck it back up and keeping things at
least in that cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was mixed at the beginning,
I guess, so you know I do a lot over soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: soil biology, soil ecology, and this is
quite relevant, I think, soil biological
[SPEAKER_04]: processes to the role that agriculture
plays in all three of the big greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: gases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got carbon dioxide, N2O is nitrous
oxide, and methane, CH4, these are the
[SPEAKER_04]: three biggest greenhouse gases,
three most important in terms of what's
[SPEAKER_04]: causing climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And CO2 emissions, in terms of
agriculture, a lot of it has to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: organic matter decomposition, just aerobic
carbon mineralization, and when we talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about things like let's reduce tillage to
sequester more carbon, well when you till
[SPEAKER_04]: a soil, you're aerating the soil,
feeding lots of, pumping lots of oxygen
[SPEAKER_04]: into the soil, stimulates this process,
it actually burns off that organic matter
[SPEAKER_04]: so fast that it doesn't really have time
to do as much good in terms of its
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial effects on soil quality and
soil health, just burning it right back up
[SPEAKER_04]: and putting it back up with CO2,
so we don't want to over till because of
[SPEAKER_04]: that, so that's kind of where that one
comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nitrous oxide emissions, this is sort of a
diagrammatic way of laying out the
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen mineralization cycle from biota
or crop residue being converted to
[SPEAKER_04]: ammonium by microbes, then being converted
to nitrate by other microbes, and under
[SPEAKER_04]: anaerobic conditions you can get
denitrification back up to N2 completing
[SPEAKER_04]: the nitrogen cycle, all of this soil
microbial activity, crucial to all of
[SPEAKER_04]: these.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I wanted to point out with this
graphic is that nitrous oxide is sort of a
[SPEAKER_04]: happenstance, you might say, offshoot of
this very natural process but the more
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen we put on, either as ammonium
nitrate synthetic fertilizer or the more
[SPEAKER_04]: manure we put on here, we're going to
crank this cycle more and more and more
[SPEAKER_04]: and the more we run through this cycle,
the more volume of nitrogen fertilizer we
[SPEAKER_04]: have going through this, whether it's
organic or inorganic, the more nitrous
[SPEAKER_04]: oxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is why nitrogen fertilizer use is
probably the key reason why we're having
[SPEAKER_04]: exponential rise in nitrous oxide
emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nitrous oxide is a very important
component in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So agriculture is a key player in that
important greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, methane emissions,
we all hear about the burping of cows,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's anaerobic bacteria, methanogens,
who live in the gut of cows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also those kind of bacteria live in rice
anaerobic conditions in wetlands and rice
[SPEAKER_04]: paddy fields and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So methanogenesis in relation to
agriculture, both livestock, rice paddy
[SPEAKER_04]: production and other things like that,
is another important part of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also methane emissions from breakdown of
manure as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tillage and soil health, I already
mentioned, reducing tillage is one
[SPEAKER_04]: approach to increasing soil carbon
sequestration.
[SPEAKER_04]: My current grad student, Sam Bosco,
was working on a very difficult problem of
[SPEAKER_04]: if farmers are going to begin trying to
develop new accounting tools for keeping
[SPEAKER_04]: track of soil carbon, if they're going to
reduce tillage, are they really doing what
[SPEAKER_04]: they think they're doing and sequestering
more carbon in their soils?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we actually measure the carbon in
soils cheaply, cost effectively?
[SPEAKER_04]: As those of you who have done a little of
this kind of work, you know you can take a
[SPEAKER_04]: room this size and you can probably spend
a career getting soil cores and measuring
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon and still not be sure you got it
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do we make some guesstimates of
soil carbon on a fairly big landscape farm
[SPEAKER_04]: scale to begin doing that accounting?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's tricky and there's a lot of
compromises that have to be made,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we and many others around the country
are working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing in terms of you have to develop
some strategic approaches to soil
[SPEAKER_04]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It usually starts with developing some
maps and just characterizing and
[SPEAKER_04]: stratifying across major vegetation types
and soil types and courses you might think
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So developing an ideal sampling scheme.
[SPEAKER_04]: One problem with trying to get at the
actual carbon sequestered in soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: we actually have to have a bulk density
measurement as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't just measure carbon
concentration from a soil core.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get undisturbed cores to do
bulk density.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very labor intensive, straightforward
thing to do, but tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we have to go to deeper depths to
really know what's happening in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're really doing is developing
geospatial models where we're coming up
[SPEAKER_04]: with some very cheap and expensive things
that we can measure that we're using
[SPEAKER_04]: visible to near infrared spectroscopy
measurements, which once you get the
[SPEAKER_04]: system going, you can actually have a
tractor mounted device with a sickle
[SPEAKER_04]: that's kind of going down through the soil
and flashing light in the soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: getting reflectivity from that,
looking at the wavelength, reflectivity,
[SPEAKER_04]: and using that to estimate soil carbon and
developing models to predict soil carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: based on very cheap, easy methods like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to look at soil carbon change in the
future, if a farmer's willing to get paid
[SPEAKER_04]: in carbon markets for sequestering carbon,
we also have to get into climate model
[SPEAKER_04]: projections and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot going on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to the story of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already talked about the nitrous oxide
emissions part of nitrogen fertilizer use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've all been hearing for many years
about the importance of being efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: with our nitrogen use.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of reducing nitrate pollutants
into our ground waters and surface waters,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just another incentive for
climate change concern because we have
[SPEAKER_04]: both nitrous oxide emissions and also
synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's what you're using, they're very
energy intensive to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of them are four to six tons of
carbon emitted in the atmosphere or CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: equivalents emitted in the atmosphere per
ton of nitrogen manufacture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just buying your bag of nitrogen
fertilizer adds to your carbon footprint,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could say, of a farm or a
garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is showing a table with looking at
some different components to a mixed dairy
[SPEAKER_04]: crop system and the CO2, the nitrous
oxide, methane emissions, everything from
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizer use to manure management,
manure handling and decomposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I wanted to point out is that as
we often see, it's not the CO2 emissions
[SPEAKER_04]: that are a big part of the carbon budget
for farms, it's the nitrous oxide
[SPEAKER_04]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not the tractor driving and the
gas coming out of the back of the tractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it has to do with nitrogen
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So important thing in terms of educating
farmers about greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot we can do in terms of nitrogen
management, going back to our legumes and
[SPEAKER_04]: recycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Harold S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and others at Cornell, when I'm involved
with looking at some of this sweet corn,
[SPEAKER_04]: developing new approaches to the nitrogen
model, nitrogen management, using soil
[SPEAKER_04]: models that take into account real-time
weather data, being more efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's not forget, we have over three
million acres of turf in New York State,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of that lawn is not,
the nitrogen is not managed very
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a big low-hanging fruit in
terms of educating homeowners about the
[SPEAKER_04]: importance of nitrogen in greenhouse
gases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should all recognize this picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I've often said in my cropping
systems ecology class, I think this is
[SPEAKER_04]: really a big challenge for agricultural
scientists of this century.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past century, we figured out how to
decouple animal crop production systems
[SPEAKER_04]: for economies of scale, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been good for economics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to somehow come back and think
about how to still maintain profits for
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers, keep up the economies,
but recouple and begin to utilize these
[SPEAKER_04]: resources like manure, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And aerobic digesters are one of the
important solutions to greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_04]: mitigation on the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And farmers are very interested in this
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reduces their cost of production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something a lot of interest in farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, our challenge is kind of moving
towards a couple summary slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I think we have to get over
the notion, and we're really the first
[SPEAKER_04]: generation of people that have to do this,
is something that the past historical
[SPEAKER_04]: climate where we live is what we should be
basing our decisions on, because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: really just not valid anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a moving target now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our generation is really going to be
challenged to develop new approaches to
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental monitoring, things like
where are the insect pests moving,
[SPEAKER_04]: how is the climate changing where,
originally what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a lot of these new decision tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just enough to know that
something's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you're talking about a farmer
making an investment in something to
[SPEAKER_04]: adapt, it's like when did they make that
investment and how much did they invest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need some tools to help them make
those decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a lot of things we can do
to come up with these win-win strategies
[SPEAKER_04]: for mitigation on the farm and still
helping the bottom line for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really I think there's a lot of
enthusiasm among farmers for this,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of them do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just involved in leading every 10
years or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: The land grant universities get together
and develop this thing called the science
[SPEAKER_04]: roadmap for the future 10 years and the
big issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was asked to lead a group of people
around the country developing the climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change piece of that just for what it's
worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the big research areas laid out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's some climate science
issues, better regional downscaling,
[SPEAKER_04]: more weather-based decisions support for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another research area, not surprisingly,
better models for weeds and pests,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly specialty crops, which is
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for specialty, for special.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everything besides corn and soybean,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: A very important one, I think,
is economic assessments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just what the impacts might be,
but what are my costs to adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decision science and decision support
tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do people really make those changes?
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes people make certain kinds of
decisions?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do people change their behavior?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do people need for decision support?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some very modeling, more complex,
entire food, shed networks, and that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Various things we can think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these are fairly straightforward
adaptation strategies, breeding crops for
[SPEAKER_04]: more high-temperature stress, drought
stress, improve water management,
[SPEAKER_04]: nonchemical options.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the mitigation piece, we need to come
up with some new tools for farmers to
[SPEAKER_04]: begin to be able to develop these
greenhouse gas budgets for their farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think agriculture in the long run
is going to be the only industry exempt
[SPEAKER_04]: from having to gradually, eventually,
begin to work in the part of their system,
[SPEAKER_04]: having some information about what's
happening with greenhouse gas emissions in
[SPEAKER_04]: their operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's a market opportunity for
them, or it has to do with simple
[SPEAKER_04]: monitoring, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Communication and, of course, policy
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were just what a group of people
around the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: group of scientists came up with for some
of the issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a full report on anybody who's
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll stop here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a partial list of people I've
worked with for a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to mention there's some funders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Northeast SARE has funded a lot of this
work, and the ICERDA organization,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: These websites, Cornell has a climate
change website, if you're very single to
[SPEAKER_04]: remember, climatechange.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Climatefarm.org has a lot of PowerPoint
slides on some of the stuff I talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is that Northeast Climate Impact
Assessment Report.
[SPEAKER_04]: This SAP43 is the most recent U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: national assessment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I co-authored the agriculture chapter,
and you can get that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, which is the main source
[SPEAKER_04]: of all climate change stuff, IPCC.ch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll stop there and take a few minutes
for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do Geneva first, since they're
farther away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to look at Geneva before you can
answer the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you try to couple back animal waste and
fertility, you run into the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_05]: problem, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That there's too much phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need cows to produce manure with less
phosphorus and more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we just need the dairy scientists
to come up with some new kind of cow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what we really need are some
creative, I think that's just one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: something blocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, another big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other big one is just the bulk of
the material and moving all that bulk
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think for those two big
challenges, that's what the guys in this
[SPEAKER_04]: room are going to figure out and the
animal scientists are going to figure out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think one thing is creating
incentives that would make it,
[SPEAKER_04]: create opportunities for business
entrepreneurs who think they've got
[SPEAKER_04]: something to do with those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's some minimal level of
processing to resolve some of these things
[SPEAKER_04]: or new ways of handling things or some
other strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it could also be just the degree to
which manure is just integrated with other
[SPEAKER_04]: parts of the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't have the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see some hands here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that kind of involves my
question as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting more and more interested
in dairy systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that I've kind of seen is
that it's not necessarily that we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have the technology or the people that can
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that we don't have the financial
backing or the policies in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can design manure digesters
that can volatilize off nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: precipitate out phosphorus, and you're
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it can't be that hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just mix limestone and raise the pH
and phosphorus precipitates and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with the manure digesters where
they're generating electricity on farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're selling that electricity back to
the grid at $0.04 a kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to buy it back at $0.13.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't make any sense for a dairy
farmer to install one of these turbines
[SPEAKER_03]: when they're losing $0.08 per kilowatt
hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I talk to dairy farmers,
they get really frustrated with that,
[SPEAKER_03]: understandably.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that if we're going to get
serious, we need politicians and we need
[SPEAKER_03]: policy in place to support them.
[SPEAKER_04]: To give you a little bit of encouragement
for what it's worth, I am on this New York
[SPEAKER_04]: State Climate Action Council, which is
going directly to the governor's office.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a whole group of people from
scientists as well as non-scientists
[SPEAKER_04]: involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: In developing policy recommendations and
addressing issues like what you just
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned are certainly in there as we
need to come up with some of these new
[SPEAKER_04]: sorts of policies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the anaerobic digesters themselves,
I mean, farmers are really chomping at the
[SPEAKER_04]: bit to get those because there's a lot of
benefit to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's problems with their just high
cost right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better scale production and maybe
just engineering coming up with new lower
[SPEAKER_04]: cost versions or developing co-ops with
small family farms and shared anaerobic
[SPEAKER_04]: digesters.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of those things, what it's worth
anyway, there's people who are talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about those things in New York State and
trying to get the word out of the chain of
[SPEAKER_04]: command to begin doing something about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always like other entities that
work against you on some of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have, of course, focused on the
effects of the climate on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about the effects of the plants
on the climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on mitigation and
sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the realistic
prospect for afforestation or other ways
[SPEAKER_01]: of sequestration?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the question is will
afforestation sort of help us resolve some
[SPEAKER_04]: of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a really important part
of the portfolio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing, I'm going back to this
climate action council, one thing we're
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about is just something like 90%
of the timberland in New York State is
[SPEAKER_04]: privately owned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing we would like to,
from a climate change perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you'd like to see is incentives for
those who have trees not to be cutting
[SPEAKER_04]: them down because that's just going to be
a major carbon loss to the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maintaining even just the carbon stocks
we have in our forests separate from
[SPEAKER_04]: afforestation is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been back of the envelope
calculations done on how many acres of
[SPEAKER_04]: land would it take, how much new tree
planting would we have to do per year
[SPEAKER_04]: globally to keep up with the CO2 emissions
projected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's out of sight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not going to solve the problem
that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like we're not going to solve the
problem by substituting some biofuels and
[SPEAKER_04]: fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it could certainly be part of the
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And trees, at least, can buy us some time
if you have a 50-year, 100-year window of
[SPEAKER_04]: sequestration of carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, although that carbon may end
up decomposing and going back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: atmosphere 100 years from now,
we've saved ourselves maybe the time it
[SPEAKER_04]: takes to come up with new energy sources
and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the albedo effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plant trees, it produces albedo,
and it may result in heating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have vegetation cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a big effect in different types of
vegetation cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has effects on albedo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a few people in the country
looking at that who do remote sensing work
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty dramatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is, in fact, we're looking to
hire a Cornell, a new terrestrial
[SPEAKER_04]: biogeochemist who would really focus,
be kind of an ecologist-type person,
[SPEAKER_04]: but focus very much on vegetation impacts
on plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Cornell's looking to hire someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transpiration data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the major drivers of
transpiration is solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering, is solar radiation
levels, are you going to start to say the
[SPEAKER_02]: same, or is there going to be less
radiation with maybe more moisture in the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the solar radiation, I think,
in general, the assumption is the solar
[SPEAKER_04]: radiation's not going to change
dramatically in the next 100 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some discussion in the
literature of a so-called global dimming
[SPEAKER_04]: phenomenon, which refers to the notion
that, it kind of comes from this notion
[SPEAKER_04]: that as the planet heats in general,
more of the water that's on the surface of
[SPEAKER_04]: the planet does get up into the air above
as water vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this could mean, you know,
increases in cloud cover or greater
[SPEAKER_04]: humidity, slightly diminishing incoming
solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of that has to do, but at the same
time, the air temperature's going up,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it has a higher water holding capacity
before you actually get that dimming
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to make a long story short,
you can't project that very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, so there could be some of that
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the climate models and the various
types of climate models handle cloud cover
[SPEAKER_04]: differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a range of some variability in
how they handle that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still, within the envelope of the
projections I showed you, those climate
[SPEAKER_04]: models have all sort of fallen in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So although it creates some of our
variability in what we project in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future, I think we have accounted for the
cloud cover as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're certainly not expecting,
if the question is, are sunspots or
[SPEAKER_04]: something going to save us?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really very, very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there are some activity things
that have caused these interglacial
[SPEAKER_04]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll sometimes see in the news
someone coming out and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, sunspots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're talking about these
interglacial cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no indication that all of a
sudden the air, what takes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we are on our way to the next ice age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us 30, 40,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, in the next 100
years, we're going to double where we're
[SPEAKER_04]: at now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the moisture in the air,
[SPEAKER_03]: the humidity in the air is going to be,
I think, a very, very, very important
factor in how we're going to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I think I think why don't you
I would say I could I Think I know the
[SPEAKER_04]: answer that question is you have to save
that for our day to time But you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those those long-term cycles are
been well studied I think the climate
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists think they've got a handle on
it has to do with planetary Movements and
[SPEAKER_04]: sun activity and things like that And
there's also a feed forward and feedback
[SPEAKER_04]: and forth between co2 and temperature it's
like we're seeing now as the temperature
[SPEAKER_04]: begins to rise Due to the rise in co2
caused by human activity now, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: more co2 rise because we're melting
permafrost That's releasing more
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse gases Etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why those two coincide feed on
each other back and forth So it creates
[SPEAKER_04]: those cycles, but I don't think there's
any evidence that we're condensing that
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle at all I think those are that cycle
is due to well-known Forcing factors that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in the global general circulation
models that they use today and they
[SPEAKER_04]: operate on these twenty thirty thousand
forty thousand year cycles And all we're
[SPEAKER_04]: expecting now is that we're pumping a
bunch of greenhouse gases sort of out of
[SPEAKER_04]: nowhere out of deep in the earth
Unexpectedly and we're just going to bump
[SPEAKER_04]: the temperature up rapidly and that's
staying that same driving force bring this
[SPEAKER_04]: towards an ice age is going to continue
but it's going to be starting at a higher
[SPEAKER_04]: place so I don't think there's a thought
that the glacial interglacial periods are
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just we're putting a good peak on
the temperature right now that that cycle
[SPEAKER_04]: is working against Any other questions
from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_05]: About the effects of global ocean
circulation And I mean if the Gulf Stream
[SPEAKER_05]: slows down England cools off a lot,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those kinds of issues Yeah, well,
there's there's sort of a range of various
[SPEAKER_04]: projections about what climate change
might do that are I would put them in the
[SPEAKER_04]: category of possible, but not you know not
things that we feel highly confident about
[SPEAKER_04]: but not not just crazy ideas there within
the realm of possibility based on what we
[SPEAKER_04]: know and that's certainly one of them that
the place like England could actually get
[SPEAKER_04]: colder because the Gulf Stream is affected
which brings this warmer is warmer ocean
[SPEAKER_04]: waters to it Again, the you know,
I could I would be getting sort of an
[SPEAKER_04]: amateur explanation of it where whereas
Climate science is coming in later in the
[SPEAKER_04]: semester to get more detailed answer,
but that's that's a real phenomenon real
[SPEAKER_04]: possibility Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that the sea level rise I didn't
get into that because it doesn't affect
[SPEAKER_04]: our agriculture in New York State that
dramatically But we've got dramatic sea
[SPEAKER_04]: level rise is a real phenomenon We're
seeing today from for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: New York City harbors about 15 inches in
the last 50 60 years Expected to continue
[SPEAKER_04]: even just with thermal expansion just as
the seas get warmer Thermal expansion
[SPEAKER_04]: across as much of that not even counting
the glacial melting and all that But it
[SPEAKER_04]: could get could be four or five times
worse than that if this Greenland ice
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf rapidly melts, which there's it's
that's another thing that is not
[SPEAKER_04]: completely out of the realm of
possibility, but is less certain so things
[SPEAKER_04]: could be much more dramatic and What I've
gotten to so yes, those are real things,
[SPEAKER_04]: but just things up You know it depends on
whether you're not mr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Business whether you lose sleep or just
having on something to save us So I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: so I don't I don't lose sleep about about
England get colder
