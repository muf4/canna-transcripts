[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can hear me all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump right into
introducing my dissertation topic on
[SPEAKER_00]: copper uptake by grasses at the plant soil
interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So copper is an essential plant
micronutrient, and it plays an important
[SPEAKER_00]: role in photosynthesis, respiration,
and reproduction in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants get their copper from soil,
and as you can see from this map of the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S., copper is naturally present in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is total concentration,
and total concentration is not the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, as we know, because soil
conditions change availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see that copper is absorbed
in higher concentrations to these soil
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents as we move up in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically, copper absorbs to iron
oxides in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also forms complexes with organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This severely limits the availability of
copper in soil, and this is particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic in this pH range 6 to about
7.5, which we know is what plants prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: in agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this limitation of copper availability
in soils severely decreases agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: production in these deficient soils,
particularly soils with high organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as was shown by the Vatamanuk lab in
2021, wheat is here, and the model species
[SPEAKER_00]: for wheat, Brachypodium destakion,
which I work on, are both very susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to copper deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When copper is at low concentrations in
their media, they struggle to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, at low concentrations,
both wheat and Brachypodium show not a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge difference in the amount of flowers
that they produce, but they do produce
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly fewer seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means for a farmer in a
copper-deficient soil is you could go out
[SPEAKER_00]: into your field and see tons of wheat
flowering and think, I'm going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, if you have copper deficiency,
you could have low seed set.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue for food security,
because wheat requires sufficient copper
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat is a member of the poaceae family,
or the grass family, which includes the
[SPEAKER_00]: key grain-producing species in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mechanism of copper uptake in
these grasses, as indicated by my title,
[SPEAKER_00]: has not been defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the question that I've
dedicated my dissertation to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the copper uptake mechanism in
grasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to look at the question,
I'm starting with the knowledge we already
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: For dicots, or non-grasses, copper is
taken up by first being reduced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper in the soil is oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets this extra electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reduced, and now it's available for
uptake by non-grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same mechanism is required for iron
uptake in non-grass plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron has to be reduced before it's
available for uptake in non-grass grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grasses, interestingly, have a
different mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take up oxidized iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how they take up copper,
but for the iron to be taken up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it must first be chelated before it is
available for grasses to access the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my dissertation, I am spending my first
two chapters looking at the mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that I just discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So considering the reduction mechanism and
its efficiency for copper uptake in
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses, same deal for the chelation-based
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my third chapter, I'm going to look at
these mechanisms in a soil system and
[SPEAKER_00]: consider how soil conditions impact the
function of these uptake mechanisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective of my first chapter is to
establish the copper deficiency response
[SPEAKER_00]: in Brachypodium, the model grass species
I'm using, via the reduction-based uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the reduction uptake mechanism
in non-grass plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for copper and iron,
here it's showing iron, same for both,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be taken up by the reduction-based
mechanism in non-grasses, the plant which
[SPEAKER_00]: is on the left side here, this is the
inside of the plant cell, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma membrane, cell wall, this is the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the oxygen oxidized iron
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant first has to solubilize this
oxidized iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this by producing protons and
potentially phenolic compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: mobilize oxidized iron in the soil so that
it can move into the cell wall and
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with this plasma membrane-bound
ferric reductase oxygenase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fro enzyme gives that oxidized metal
the electron it needs, so now it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken up by high affinity transporters and
brought into the root cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, this uptake pathway
functions for both iron and copper uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you may note that in this model with
Arabidopsis, these fro genes are somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are different fro genes for the
different metals and different high
[SPEAKER_00]: affinity transporters for the different
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very specific in each of these
uptake mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at Arabidopsis as an example
of a non-grass species, Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: expresses eight of these fro genes,
whereas Brachypodium expresses only two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the reasons that we
hypothesize that the reduction-based
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism is not the primary copper uptake
mechanism in grasses and will not respond
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly to copper deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: To investigate this hypothesis,
I am cultivating Brachypodium in
[SPEAKER_00]: deep-water hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this because during the last week of
cultivation, I can completely deprive
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants of these nutrients and look
at their response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm growing them with three treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no copper in the system for the
last week and no iron in the system for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: After these plants are harvested,
I have a two-pronged approach to analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: the reduction mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I sever the plant roots from the
shoot tissue They're then incubated in
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions that contain chromophores.
[SPEAKER_00]: These solutions develop color over time
based on the amount of metals the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are reducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take an aliquot after a specific amount
of time of this solution and measure it
[SPEAKER_00]: using UV vis, which can allow me to
calculate the concentration of metals
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced by the roots using a rearrangement
of the Beer-Lambert law.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other method of analysis is to evaluate
the transcriptional expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ferric reductase genes in Brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I separate the root and shoot
tissues and then I'm analyzing both root
[SPEAKER_00]: and shoot tissues for the two ferric
reductase enzymes I mentioned previously
[SPEAKER_00]: in Brachypodium using RTQ-PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the results from the reduction
mechanism for my preliminary trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are reported in a rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an amount of metal that is
reduced per root weight over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, you have your copper
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, there's iron reduction and
all three treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can basically say from this
data is that the plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing mineral deficiency are not
actively reducing more metals in either
[SPEAKER_00]: the copper or the iron assay compared with
the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: My transcriptional results show that the
Brachypodium FRO1 gene is really not being
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the root tissues,
but the Brachypodium FRO2 gene is
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a significant difference in
the expression of this enzyme between the
[SPEAKER_00]: control and the minus copper conditions,
but there is a significant difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the control and the minus iron
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants grown in minus iron conditions are
expressing significantly less of this
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taken together, the reduction response
data and the transcriptional data support
[SPEAKER_00]: each other to show that in the roots of
Brachypodium, this reduction response is
[SPEAKER_00]: not responding strongly to copper or iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, what we found in the shoot
tissue is a more dynamic response to these
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies in photosynthetic tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brachypodium FRO1 is expressed in shoot
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transcripts have increasing expression
under minus iron conditions and possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: minus copper, although my sample set's a
bit small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brachypodium FRO2 is expressed at
lower rates compared to control when
[SPEAKER_00]: plants experience deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that this has something to do
with the plants trying to relocate the
[SPEAKER_00]: essential nutrients that they have in
their photosynthetic tissues when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving them into photosynthesizing
tissues to ensure that they can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to photosynthesize under deficiency
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Returning to the roots, which is what we
really care about here right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: my preliminary results indicate that
Brachypodium distaccion does not respond
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly to copper deficiency with this
reduction-based mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that reason, we believe it is not
the primary uptake mechanism in grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows me to move to my second
chapter, where I'm exploring the
[SPEAKER_00]: chelation-based mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less is known about this mechanism,
so I have two objectives here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first want to determine the capacity of
associated transporters in this mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: to move copper across the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to analyze the response of the
chelate-based uptake mechanism to copper
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency in these grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm again using Brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a more detailed explanation of
the chelation-based mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left this time, you have the soil
with this insoluble iron, and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you have the cytosol inside of the
plant root cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this mechanism, eugenic acids have to
first be synthesized within the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These enzymes need to be present,
and these enzymes are only expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very special mechanism only
grasses have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they synthesize these eugenic acids,
which are seen as this squiggly organic
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule with azetidine on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this eugenic acid molecule is
exported to the rhizosphere through this
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It interacts with oxidized metal and
creates a chelate complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wraps around the metal, and then the
entire chelate complex is brought back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the root cell by these YS
transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hypothesis in this chapter is that the
chelation-based uptake mechanism will
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitate copper attainment and will
respond to copper deficiency in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will again be growing these plants in
hydroponic solution so I can induce these
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies, but this is my proposed
uptake pathway for these grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These eugenic acids are specifically
identified as Brachypodium products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that this plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the specific Brachypodium
transporters that are orthologs to the
[SPEAKER_00]: system I just showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my hypothesized pathway, these eugenic
acids are facilitating copper uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: through these transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project was funded by the SNPS small
grants program in collaboration with Patti
[SPEAKER_00]: Leva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very grateful for that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methods of analysis after these
plants are cultivated in hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions, I'll be starting by looking at
the eugenic acid quantity for those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular compounds I just showed you
that will be collected from roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be quantified using
high-performance liquid chromatography
[SPEAKER_00]: mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will then use the same method I
described in the previous chapter,
[SPEAKER_00]: RTQ-PCR, but in this case I'm going to be
quantifying the expression of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters that I just showed you that
are specific to this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the really cool part about the
collaboration, we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: heterologously express this BDYS1
transporter in an oocyte system and use
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophysiological techniques to
establish the capacity of this transporter
[SPEAKER_00]: to move copper through a plastic plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be doing this through my
collaboration with the Pianettos lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: Patti Leva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to chapter three, where I'm
going to be looking at the impact of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics on copper uptake
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, I want to think about how
pH, microbial community dynamics,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic matter, and mineralogy are
impacting the efficiency of these uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms in grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hypothesis here is that the grasses are
not expressing one or another mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're expressing multiple
mechanisms, but that they are able to rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on the mechanism best suited to their
surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This improves the efficiency and allows,
in this case Brachypodium destakion,
[SPEAKER_00]: to utilize the most efficient mechanism
for copper uptake based on its
[SPEAKER_00]: surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to evaluate this hypothesis,
I needed to take my hydroponic system to a
[SPEAKER_00]: more realistic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected a ton of soil samples that
were being cultivated from fields that
[SPEAKER_00]: were cultivated by the Sorrells wheat lab,
where they are growing a mix of wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: barley, and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the soils that I collected and
analyzed, I chose three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose the Caldwell and McGowan soils,
which are being cultivated in more
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional agricultural methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Freeville organic farm,
using more organic methods for
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these soils are poorly drained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all are part of the same taxonomy,
but they have different estimated soil
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, they have a wide range of
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pH ranges from 6.5 to 7.9 in these
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it on this side too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this difference is one of the things
that I wanted to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these different soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also performed elemental analysis on
these soils using ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm showing here is total iron and
total alumina concentrations in these
[SPEAKER_00]: three soils, which are significantly
different, indicating they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in mineralogy, but we still
need to establish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did loss on ignition to estimate
total soil organic matter percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did find some significant
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Freeville had higher concentrations of
soil organic matter, which could be
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the management techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, I did not find a lot of
difference in the total copper
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually good for me because I
want to try to move my system into
[SPEAKER_00]: something more realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to add copper to some of these
soils and see how the plants respond under
[SPEAKER_00]: these different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, I synthesized a
mineral copper oxide nanoparticle
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just really tiny tenorite
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are an average diameter of 9 to 11
nanometers, which was confirmed via XRD
[SPEAKER_00]: and TEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are confirmed monoclinic tenorite
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to apply these nanoparticles in
the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I needed to know, can the plants
actually get to this copper?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this mineral?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started doing some trials with the
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied them in Cornell Mix and grew
plants in the Weill Hall growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I specifically grew a copper deficient
mutant plant that was developed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Vatamanuk lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really sensitive to low copper
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant in the typical lab practice
is fertilized with copper sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to a mineral, I used this
copper sulfate as a control treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I added different concentrations
of copper oxide nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that the flowering response
was rescued in this mutant above about two
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million copper oxide
nanoparticle amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that didn't really tell me where the
copper was going, either in the soil or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to understand distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, I went over to the
Cornell High Energy Synchrotron facility
[SPEAKER_00]: where we carried out a collaboration using
these riso boxes to live image plants
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with the nanoparticle treated
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the results from that
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here on the bottom, look at this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here on the bottom, we have a zero
treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no addition of copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the three in the middle are
copper oxide nanoparticle treated soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same order that you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that as you increase the
treatment of nanoparticles, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of copper, not just in the
soil, but in the actual root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found was that it wasn't just the
root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also the shoot tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving up in concentration of treatment
here, these are leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stripes are the actual vasculature
within those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing higher concentrations of
copper in the leaves of plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with these copper oxide
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this confirms the idea that the
nanoparticles were not only available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, but that they were getting the
copper out and moving it through the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also be using in this chapter of my
dissertation a really important technique
[SPEAKER_00]: of multi-collector ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bore you with all the details,
but essentially this allows us to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish the primary copper uptake
mechanism by analyzing plant tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can analyze these plant tissues for the
specific stable isotope ratio for copper,
[SPEAKER_00]: which doesn't change in a chelation based
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the plant is primarily using a
reduction based mechanism for copper
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, the reduction prefers the lighter
isotope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that changes the isotope ratio in the
plant tissue and gives us a metric where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can look at which mechanism is actually
being favored based just off those copper
[SPEAKER_00]: isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very important for this
chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other methods of analysis I plan to use,
I want to look at the microbial community
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics in these soils using 16S amplicon
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use RTQ-PCR, metabolite, analysis and
the reductase assays mentioned previously
[SPEAKER_00]: to analyze the response of those
particular mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, if you take nothing else
away from this talk, copper is essential
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't know how it gets into
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my dissertation, I'm going to be
looking at two established fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake mechanisms and determining if they
are functioning in these grasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are what's bringing the copper in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response of copper uptake
mechanisms to different soil conditions is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be evaluated in pot studies using
field soil as an attempt to apply these
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental concepts in a more realistic
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I want to thank my committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been so incredible to be co-advised
and get to be part of two amazing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great for my interdisciplinary
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thanks to all the people on
this slide and my critters and my fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, please check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the new Exleap project at the
Cornell High Energy Synchrotron.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are amazing opportunities for
biologists, for soil scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be great for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
