[SPEAKER_03]: I want to show you a rare work at the
crossroads of criminal justice and
[SPEAKER_03]: education.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are two key controversies in our
society and their intersection is not
[SPEAKER_03]: random.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that people who end up caught in
the criminal justice system come from
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhoods with low quality schools,
amongst many other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experience of incarceration tends to
make tall barriers to higher education
[SPEAKER_03]: even taller, meaning it's much less likely
that someone will end up in college if
[SPEAKER_03]: they end up in prison first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I direct the Cornell Prison
Education Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something boastful to say here
about our program, but I think it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessary now that Don's given that lovely
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: The work I'll share with you today is from
the work I did before Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: My project was an attempt to do things in
horticulture education that were new,
[SPEAKER_03]: new in prison in particular, possibly new
in education at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we've known because of the oddness of
the environment of prison and the
[SPEAKER_03]: constraints placed upon what are now the
status quo things we expect from a college
[SPEAKER_03]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new about it is not so much the
style of horticulture education that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: getting at or implementing or how it was
sort of somehow trying to do something
[SPEAKER_03]: fundamentally different from campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is remarkable about the work is how
far I got in trying to make things the
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a good example of how
horticulture could be taught at a good
[SPEAKER_03]: college campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm looking out at you, I see several
folks who've participated in the Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: Prison Education Program welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, could we get a show of hands
quick from who you are?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's several people here in this
section over here who've been involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they will understand very well,
and some of them with no background in
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture, the challenge of this talk,
which is trying to both introduce things
[SPEAKER_03]: about prison, I presume for most folks in
here, you've never been to a high security
[SPEAKER_03]: prison in America, and at the same time
talk about the challenge of doing
[SPEAKER_03]: education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within that, the field of horticulture
in particular and what we try to do to
[SPEAKER_03]: have meaningful labs and activities for
students in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was trying to demonstrate that it was
possible to do good education in prison in
[SPEAKER_03]: the field of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope to share some of that with you
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are going to be three sections to
this talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe tell me if I talk too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been told I can go rather quickly,
but I've got a lot I'm trying to do as I
[SPEAKER_03]: just laid out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to introduce quickly higher
education in prison itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give you a quick five minutes on
the Cornell Prison Education Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll talk a little bit about the
challenges facing horticulture education,
[SPEAKER_03]: and really still education per se,
but specifically horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll talk about some of the
things I did to respond to the challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this five minute section is actually
something I do on campus to introduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: program when we're recruiting faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates who
[SPEAKER_03]: participate in our program here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A quick introduction to why we would do
college in prison, introducing the Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: Prison Education Project itself,
and then the broader context of
[SPEAKER_03]: correctional reform and what we think the
outcomes are when we put post-secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: education in prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea of education in prison is
nothing new.
[SPEAKER_03]: This image on the left over here is
actually 100 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auburn, New York, a prison we work in
today, classroom, adults, learning,
[SPEAKER_03]: grade school level curriculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the reason we call them
correctional centers in American
[SPEAKER_03]: societies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this image of rehabilitation in
prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is that you don't just put people
in a cell and abandon them for 10 years
[SPEAKER_03]: and expect something dramatically
different to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You rehabilitate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You offer them programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You educate folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an image from the 70s when the Pell
Grants were made available for the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time you had financial aid in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: College programs entered into the prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was an era in which college
programs flourished in American prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speeding into the 80s and 90s,
America was reeling from questions of what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do about crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, many of us may be too
young for this, but if you can remember,
[SPEAKER_03]: the drum beat of politics back then was
there's too much crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: This other politician hasn't been harsh
enough about crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy here thinks people in prison
should be taking college classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: This person here thinks he should only get
six months for this crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to give him 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would see over a couple of decades
this trend towards punitiveness,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking away programs from people who've
been convicted of crimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, the Crime Bill of 1994 made
it illegal for people in prison to receive
[SPEAKER_03]: Pell Grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overnight we end up with a lot of empty
classrooms where there used to be college
[SPEAKER_03]: classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question then is really what do we
want to do when there's harm in society?
[SPEAKER_03]: When someone's convicted of a crime and we
send them away to a prison, what do we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to have happen with those
individuals?
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, these are the status quo here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of exercise yards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably have seen these images.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you read the New York Times,
there's kind of a drum beat right now of
[SPEAKER_03]: we aren't doing a lot of productive stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might even be making folks more
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making license plates actually happens at
Auburn Prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a photo from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a site that I saw actually
down the hall from where my classroom was
[SPEAKER_03]: in Illinois where a gym is turned into a
bunk bed unit because of the overcrowding
[SPEAKER_03]: of prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people don't want to spend money
on this, but they don't have another
[SPEAKER_03]: answer right now currently than just more
and more incarceration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you end up with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is even taking away exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we've got folks that are literally
just in a sort of refugee kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an image from a Cornell classroom
happening at Auburn Prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a pair of graduate students at
the front here, Aidan Lears and Dan
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinekian, the year before both of them
pulled down professorships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aidan's at SUNY Oswego and Dan out at
Grinnell teaching a literature seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are students many in the room will
recognize from this section over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a conversation about literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these classes count in our
partnership with a community college
[SPEAKER_03]: towards an associate degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob in the room here in this photo,
along with Ron Sieber, as well as the
[SPEAKER_03]: president and provost of Cayuga Community
College who work with Cornell in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: make an associate's degree accessible to
these 15 men who graduated on this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular day in 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the middle, we have a
philanthropist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Key theme of this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without financial aid, you basically have
no money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no tuition revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The folks that are in America's prisons
are of the lowest economic strata.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's really no way to fund college
in prison, let alone combat the political
[SPEAKER_03]: climate that makes it so difficult to do
this without someone providing private
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars and typically not the students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the three prisons that Cornell
operates in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auburn Correctional Facility up in Auburn,
a medium security prison down here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Moravia, very similar to the one I'll be
discussing today in Illinois, and a
[SPEAKER_03]: maximum security prison in Romulus called
Five Points Corrections.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an image of a couple of our former
students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, who I presented at a conference in
Nashville with last week, is now a
[SPEAKER_03]: part-time student at Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: John, another one of our former students,
is a carpenter in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here he is actually participating in
building homeless shelters with an
[SPEAKER_03]: organization I think in Kimong County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of our undergraduates as they go
out into the world, many of whom get
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in the intersection between
criminal justice and the other fields
[SPEAKER_03]: they've studied in, wearing green cords in
the graduate school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our graduation ceremonies, our undergrads
wear green cords to symbolize the green
[SPEAKER_03]: prison uniforms that our students on the
inside of the prison walls.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good question, Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no prisons that have a mix of
both genders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to go back, is it there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all male prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, we could talk about that one
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of questions it raises for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like there might be a question
from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I heard a repeat question so
Geneva can hear you better.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Geneva, the question was, those are a
lot of women coming from Cornell into a
[SPEAKER_03]: prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the prisons male and female or mixed?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer was no.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are men's prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can kind of guess where that
conversation would go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's maybe pull it off on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Willard.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, the woman on the line here,
is sharing that right next to Five Points
[SPEAKER_03]: Correctional Facility, right over here,
there's a drug treatment and
[SPEAKER_03]: rehabilitation center, which actually is
one of the main alternatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of count that as a non-prison,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a confinement facility, but it's
intended to be a short stay and release
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're being treated for drug
treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a co-ed carceral facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to zoom ahead here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about this
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the head in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the challenge is faced by a person who
wants to just bring a solid horticulture
[SPEAKER_03]: education into the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks who want to do something positive
with their lives have a chance to do
[SPEAKER_03]: something better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I going back to the challenges
after having just spoken about the denial
[SPEAKER_03]: of financial aid and so on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are many other issues,
both broad and specific to this
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation, which undergird the work and
present tremendous conflicts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The broader problem is that we have 2.3
million people in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 6.7 million people under
correctional supervision.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's parole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over 70 million people currently alive
with criminal records.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we think about these, the challenges to
employing and generating gainful,
[SPEAKER_03]: positive futures for our society out of
that negative resume that all those folks
[SPEAKER_03]: are carrying with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're trying to combat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, as an institution of higher
learning, we're in a position to offer
[SPEAKER_03]: education, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does a university do in prison?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably educate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally, the population we find in
prison lacks access to good education.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't had a good background.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't come from the best high
schools.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't web designers already.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't coming with all the skills
that a lot of our students would come
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come from communities with
inconsistent institutions, inconsistent
[SPEAKER_03]: mother tongue languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no ladder in front of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good high school to a good two-year
college to a good four-year college.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's usually the path that we try
to construct on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, in Illinois, I was really
trying to defy the odds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to fly through some of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main thing, and the folks who've
been in prisons before, you might chime in
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_03]: To work within the system to change it is
tremendously difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any campus educator who doesn't know the
correctional environment might be
[SPEAKER_03]: surprised to learn that, generally,
there's no one-on-one conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no email.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no office hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be no phone calls or notes with
your students.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's barely any library resources of an
academic type.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just name drop in your class
because your students can't go to
[SPEAKER_03]: Wikipedia and look up the name of that
person that you were referencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Common items are considered potential
weapons or contraband, including scissors,
[SPEAKER_03]: large paper clips, DVDs, chewing gum,
sugar packets, anything made of metal or
[SPEAKER_03]: glass, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can imagine now why I'm saying the
majority of what I'm trying to do is just
[SPEAKER_03]: do a normal education in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what you see a lot of times when
you go into prison is these kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: aberrations of reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we doing it this way?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because these rules have made it
impossible to do it in the regular way.
[SPEAKER_03]: To put it in perspective, many of the
things I accomplished in the Illinois
[SPEAKER_03]: prison system thus far have been
impossible for us to accomplish here in
[SPEAKER_03]: upstate New York with the Cornell Prison
Education Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that derives from the fact that
the program I did in Illinois,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had made the decision to try to work
inside the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I infiltrated the system as opposed to
Cornell's, which is from without.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to give you an image of this,
teachers generally I presume in my
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues throughout the world,
don't have the experience of calling a
[SPEAKER_03]: watchtower on a walkie talkie to tell them
that they're moving 11 inmates to a garden
[SPEAKER_03]: with shovels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a walkie talkie, I had keys,
and I had to secure every single tool when
[SPEAKER_03]: they weren't in use.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, I was the only person
in the facility during day shift with a
[SPEAKER_03]: PhD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I attained the Appalachian Doc,
folks who knew me as the one person around
[SPEAKER_03]: who was highly educated and trying to
create an intellectual culture there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really trying to understand the
structural challenges that were
[SPEAKER_03]: surmountable to make it possible to have a
real rehabilitative educational program
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the challenges facing
horticulture in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do them fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-rehabilitation culture of the
prison, competition from other units in
[SPEAKER_03]: the facility, and then inmate cynicism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you think about it, this is
really the overall anti-rehabilitation and
[SPEAKER_03]: the sort of inside of the components of
the prison, and then person by person
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after the denial of Pell grants,
and we might be feeling this this week in
[SPEAKER_03]: our country in a lot of ways, a change in
policy or a change in political era will
[SPEAKER_03]: come with a feeling of mandate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so correctional staff were emboldened
to feel like it was all right to oppose
[SPEAKER_03]: all forms of corrections in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just formally because there aren't
Pell grants, but also informally to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Owens is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see why he has to come in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see his name on the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna let him in today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just this kind of micro resistance to
education barriers were set up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we lost the keys to that classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not using it today.
[SPEAKER_03]: This type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this persists to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was rampant racist and sexist
statements in my experience of working at
[SPEAKER_03]: this prison on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something I think even our
folks that work from the program at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell don't hear as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gender binary of the system is really
makes a very, very macho environment in
[SPEAKER_03]: these places.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Don's question is really right
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when you send women there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really permeated the day to day
experience of the facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna talk about this in a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually kept the log of all this
stuff, because this was upsetting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was traumatizing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hearing my students described in a
way I didn't like, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And people opposing my mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was my therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually would just say, today someone
called one of my students a dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today someone called one of my students a
beaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are these kind of racially loaded
words.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I worked with this author,
James Lowen, who is at American University
[SPEAKER_03]: in DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a historian.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wrote this book called Sundown Towns.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew up in Decatur, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he remembers there were these towns
called sundown towns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've heard about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quick thing is towns in the early 20th
century in Illinois would put signs on the
[SPEAKER_03]: border of the town.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would say things like whites only
within city limits after dark,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the more common one and a slightly more
vulgar one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the sun goes down and your ass is
brown, you better get out of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a lot of times there's a dark colored
donkey, and it's just running.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the image.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was a way of announcing that
these towns didn't let black people live
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could work there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the sun went down, you had to be
out of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why am I bringing this up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked in a place where there were a lot
of sundown towns in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's prison towns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at Carterville real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from some of my research.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually a place where I had to go
for my training.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a sundown town in Decatur.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Carterville in the old days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did the black folks go if they could
work in Carterville in the old days but
[SPEAKER_03]: they couldn't actually live there?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little town called Culp up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all documented in that book I just
referenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: City council statements, real estate
records, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I went to Carterville for my
training, I just checked this out,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd already been working in the Department
of Corrections.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I went to Culp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Carterville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to John Logan College,
which is where it's now the training
[SPEAKER_03]: center for Southern Illinois for the
Department of Corrections.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think most people would know that
John Logan, if you go back in time,
[SPEAKER_03]: was the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically made his political career on
what's called the Negro Exclusion Act in
[SPEAKER_03]: quotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like this language anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But his career was started in trying to
exclude black folks from Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really Illinois's move.
[SPEAKER_03]: We remember it today as the land of
Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my colleagues in Illinois, this is a
saying to Don beforehand.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't want to hear this today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is empirical.
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say specifically here,
I went to Culp because I was driving from
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern area here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an all-black settlement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Carterville is not an all-white
settlement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, it really is not the Sun Downtown
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't misconstrue what I'm trying to
say here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We no longer live in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Culp is basically, we'd call it like a
trailer settlement.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of low-income white folks there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I went to John Logan College,
a lot of black folks were going to college
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really not in that system
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was a legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we at today?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 1952 map of where the Sun
Downtowns were in southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so cities that are denoted by all caps
and bold were the known Sun Downtowns of
[SPEAKER_03]: this region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see I've got Carterville on the
red block there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the prison I was working in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it extends up to northern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people know about Cicero and
certain cities that were famous for this
[SPEAKER_03]: up north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, this is where we have prisons and
jails in southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are basically prison towns,
jail towns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we could say to ourselves,
well, maybe we just completely got rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: racism in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all went away.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing correlating between these
two whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just happens to be a comparable number,
about 52 Sun Downtowns and about 46 jail
[SPEAKER_03]: towns.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the thing that really drives the
field in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will be, hopefully, out in an
article next year in American Studies of
[SPEAKER_03]: the incarceration rate in the state of
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see, if we go back to 52,
we've got around 8,000 people in jails and
[SPEAKER_03]: prisons in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these pie charts down here,
they don't always report demographic data
[SPEAKER_03]: for various reasons in the correction
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But about 60% white back then and about
less than a quarter in 1999, the last time
[SPEAKER_03]: I had data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is basically up to the time of
the work I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing I want to point out
here is the dashed line is just counting
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities according to this numeration
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best time, in a certain sense,
to be in prison in Illinois would have
[SPEAKER_03]: been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the number was the lowest,
about 6,000 people in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had 11 facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means people had the most space.
[SPEAKER_03]: The highest inmate to staff ratio,
if they were involved in programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you see them starting to
close prisons here, while the number keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: going up, we're about 50,000 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the overcrowding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anti-rehabilitation culture of the
prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: This just made the whole project all the
more loaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because not only are you trying to say,
hey, could you help this student get from
[SPEAKER_03]: the housing unit over to the classroom?
[SPEAKER_03]: This person is late or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got this constant drumbeat of
these folks are really not worthy of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not always in explicit racial terms,
but a lot of times in terms of just
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're considered criminals or
inmates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't deserve an education.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the mood of the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Competition from other prison functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's how the prison works.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the actual prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Google map.
[SPEAKER_03]: The orange house units, X houses as we
call them, had 400 people each in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one's missing of wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a solitary confinement unit over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's cut off that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a school and gym.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where my classroom was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perimeter fence keeps everyone in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this extra fence there blocks off
the exercise yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the purple room there, you have
some folks making cardboard boxes and
[SPEAKER_03]: prison uniforms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every prison usually has some industry
where they try to produce something.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 20 inmates had access to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of about 1,600 inmates at this
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, but here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The prison administration and security
personnel in general preferred to limit
[SPEAKER_03]: inmate movement all together unless it was
completely necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to get a student from the school
building to the garden, which we'll talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about in a second, was a tremendous act of
asking for permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how they like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an X house in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grass has been pretty poorly treated.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a completely controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see if people didn't want to send
folks out to the exercise yard,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could just say exercise in here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was in this area, I had two
watchtowers on either side of the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was always this kind of
constant surveillance of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can imagine then, if you've got a
party that's in the watchtower that's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of looking to stop education, they
basically had a kind of constant
[SPEAKER_03]: micromanagerial kind of thing they were
doing of saying, I think I saw someone do
[SPEAKER_03]: something wrong there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can get on a loudspeaker from a
watchtower and say, inmate so-and-so,
[SPEAKER_03]: come over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you need to go back to the classroom or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these were the resistances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zooming in a little bit more, you can see
here's the school.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd have to walk out here to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see there's a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually, I mean, the main
thing here is this should be an
[SPEAKER_03]: environment of a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a 0.91 acre garden space that's
been pre-established at the prison and a
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this grounds crew at the prison,
which, yeah, I'm going to break the seal
[SPEAKER_03]: and say the prison was corrupt and stool
pigeons got to be in the grounds crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the grounds crew got the greenhouse
and the garden before I established this
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of funding apparatus by which we
could have a horticulture program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to work really hard politically
to get access to this greenhouse for my
[SPEAKER_03]: students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could not get access to the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the place that basically a
collection of 10 inmates on this grounds
[SPEAKER_03]: crew, which would do lawn mowing,
including lawn mowing outside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: fence, driving tractors around,
raking leaves to the extent there were
[SPEAKER_03]: trees, getting ice off the sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they could hang out in a greenhouse in
the cold winter when all the housing units
[SPEAKER_03]: were fairly cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people didn't have any space
because they were stuck in a small cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be in a greenhouse growing
poinsettias for the administrator's
[SPEAKER_03]: office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they never in the 2 and 1 half
years I was in this program let our
[SPEAKER_03]: program use the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually the only photo I have of
myself in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is actually the classroom in
the school building.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see these tall sort of
warehouse-like walls, no windows.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a green hoodie here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea a camera person was coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see some of the students here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also see there's some folks on the
computers back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so imagine after the first
frost, when the garden is effectively not
[SPEAKER_03]: useful any longer in terms of doing new
projects, waterlogged, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: that the grounds crew will control the
greenhouse are particularly frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the inmate cynicism about vocational
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finally, then you have this question of
how do you find good students in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to do this quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually the only thing that the
state of Illinois does in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: post-secondary education opportunities
when universities and colleges don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: proactive campaigns like Cornell's and the
University of Illinois program.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's Danville.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got three types of courses that are
offered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Automative technology, horticulture,
and career technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those three things?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Automotive tech?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was doing custom paint jobs on
correctional officers' cars and trucks for
[SPEAKER_03]: free or for the cost of the paint,
suping up their engines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember people detailing carburetors
and putting insignias and American flags
[SPEAKER_03]: on the different parts of the cars and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then career tech was a six-week class
in which you learned how to turn on a
[SPEAKER_03]: computer and use Microsoft Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the status quo into which you're
about to see me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I trying to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: A brief comment on jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone always wants to ask about jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do a whole presentation on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just one paper chart from a 2012
study, Comfortable Time in Indiana,
[SPEAKER_03]: right next door to where we were at,
in terms of what kind of job outcomes in a
[SPEAKER_03]: group of 5,000 or more folks had over a
five-year sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these red boxes are just trying to
show any overlap with, in the way this
[SPEAKER_03]: paper defined it, the categories of
post-secondary education that are offered
[SPEAKER_03]: in the prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even get into what are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to put an asterisk, academic
programs have a much wider range of
[SPEAKER_03]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just talking with Tommy about one of
our folks that was in our program,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one at Columbia, is now an Uber
driver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another who is now at Lehman College is a
registered nurse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another who is going to that school of
business in Baruch College is a paralegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: John's a carpenter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is a carpentry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some overlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the whole point of having a
liberal arts education, is we think that
[SPEAKER_03]: liberal arts education will lead you to a
proper consideration of having examined
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, good time is a 100-year-old
concept that, I'm going really fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said I wouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an old idea in prison,
which is you've got a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did something bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get released one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are going to come back to
prison for doing another bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you could take some of them,
figure out some activity to give them,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would guarantee that when they go
out, they're productive, and they become
[SPEAKER_03]: taxpayers, and they don't come back?
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be really valuable to the state,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could take that activity and
actually credit them and give them time
[SPEAKER_03]: off their sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could incentivize them to become these
good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's called good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 100 years on, that has become the most
pinataed concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so bureaucratized and barrier-ridden
that it's almost impossible to implement
[SPEAKER_03]: this in a good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, I'm highlighting here
that the very definition of it in Illinois
[SPEAKER_03]: said that people who had violent offenses,
sex offenses, or anything involving a
[SPEAKER_03]: weapon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if I go into a store and no one
gets hurt, but I said I have a knife on
[SPEAKER_03]: me, you're never getting good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't even explain this to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, the time it takes to get a
few months off your sentence, it starts
[SPEAKER_03]: all the way in the courthouse before
you're in prison and extends all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: to the day of your release.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's six different layers of
review.
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically would spend more time
getting the good time than getting off of
[SPEAKER_03]: your sentence by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the actual people that got good
time from my program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had about 120 people over those two
years take classes with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 students were eligible at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone who's eligible tries to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they fill out contracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, I would get about three if they
were to take all my courses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So days are credited towards release from
prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rule in Illinois is you get
half of that number of days off of your
[SPEAKER_03]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually calculate out the
number of days, or in this case,
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it by years, of sentence reduction
that my course generated, multiply that by
[SPEAKER_03]: the cost per person in prison,
and then there's a cost savings to the
[SPEAKER_03]: state of about $35,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: These ones with parentheses, these are
folks that didn't get the credit in the
[SPEAKER_03]: end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their contract was voided because,
again, they did, you know, inmate was out
[SPEAKER_03]: of place, got written up, threw out their
good time, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a pen that was unauthorized throughout
their good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there would have been actually much
more, but ineligibility and that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: constant rule micromanagement interfered
with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, this was the real point.
[SPEAKER_03]: People then become hugely cynical about
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these were some of my worst students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these are the folks that were
basically like, OK, I'm stuck at Danville.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got another three years in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Automotive tech, I don't want to go detail
some officer's car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Career tech, well, that's only six weeks,
so I'm only going to just turn on a
[SPEAKER_03]: computer and get out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing you can get out of that is
a couple of weeks off your sentence
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this Doc Scott guy, and he's like
making everyone go out to a garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'll try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would be the students that would
be there saying, if I get out of my chair,
[SPEAKER_03]: will I lose good time?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get a C minus, can I still have good
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't come to class tomorrow because
I feel sick, am I going to get good time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you credit the day for a good time if
I leave early today because I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: virus?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was just the constant
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this actually is just another
barrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just an example on the
individual level barrier to this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, this is what we wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Responses to the challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to underscore how rare and unheard
of this work is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will hear me now reference a garden
with hundreds of species of plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: a library with thousands of titles on its
shelf, computers in the classroom,
[SPEAKER_03]: students participating in the construction
of meaningful projects aimed at helping
[SPEAKER_03]: their fellow men.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really against the odds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the infighting environment of prison
and against considerable resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've of course said this now many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll spare you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the three parts of this,
or two parts of this section.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be quick so we can have some
Q&A.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fundamentally everything this
education work is about, is trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: respond to this contentious environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, hopefully, particularly this
week, creating an environment where people
[SPEAKER_03]: can really have a discussion with each
other and try to understand each other and
[SPEAKER_03]: try to move forward into a fruitful future
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll talk a little bit about some
of the specific things that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a classroom I taught of guys in
2013 for the University of Illinois and my
[SPEAKER_03]: other Pat, which is an educational
researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to point out, look at the
mood in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an all-male facility, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are not in a mode of being
dangerous, psychopathically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any little micro thing they do is going to
be a trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a community that formed around our
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see part of the library here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a library that's spread over three
rooms the way that we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to sit at seminar tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're reading research articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know all these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the main difference between folks
that do this work firsthand, like some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the folks here in the room, and folks that
talk about this and write about it but
[SPEAKER_03]: have never visited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Johnny Page is in Governor
State University today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Braun, a guy from New Jersey,
like me, happen to know him, is about to
[SPEAKER_03]: publish an article in Harvard Educational
Review.
[SPEAKER_03]: Came out of some of this educational work
we did there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The prison's trying to block him from
publishing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a really dangerous topic of how
education for prisoners could enhance
[SPEAKER_03]: democracy by having people have informed
voices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Harvard likes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Administration, not so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's a person who's now a teacher in
a Catholic school in Morelia in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was deported, even though he was
brought to the US when he was one year
[SPEAKER_03]: old, sentenced without evidence at the age
of 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did 15 years in the prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was my age and is now living in Mexico,
where he'd never lived before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a Catholic school teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his wife is a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: She works in a college there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all people with names to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all people that are actually doing
things that are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing to remember through
all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into what I was doing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually, I didn't know they were
going to take this photo either.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the day of my job interview where
they said, look, we tilled up the land for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked to a bunch of people who know
nothing about horticulture who hired me to
[SPEAKER_03]: do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I provided the funding for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to the fundamental challenge of
having no tuition money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're looking at a USGS soil survey
for the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where the garden would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing here is that folks
should be familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're looking at a Katelyn series.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Midwest soils are typically mollusks
and alphasols.
[SPEAKER_03]: The garden was in a particularly boggy
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of the things that made
this land not too valuable to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mennonites, who sold it to the state in
the early 80s and made it into a prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it turns out the garden is right in the
spot that made the site completely
[SPEAKER_03]: invaluable as a place to do agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's surrounded by corn and soybean
fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and also just to note, here's the
Indiana border.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was comparing to Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in a cell on that side of the
building, you're looking out of Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made maps of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is by itself a huge feat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine an environment in which a string
that's this long is considered contraband,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you could put it around someone's
neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never happened in this prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the type of thing they say in
the kind of constant looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: criminality mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: That runs the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let alone a tape measure, which is
metal, which is even worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually had to manufacture the
tools to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would then supplement what we were
doing with satellite photos, as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see, to try to produce sufficient drawings
to show what we were trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The red lines in this case are digging
little channels to drain the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wouldn't allow us to install
culverts, because you can hide weapons in
[SPEAKER_03]: culverts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to do this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see I'm just trying to get the
water to go in one direction away from
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right away, tremendous amounts of food
waste going on in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the goal in Illinois is to feed people
on $1 per day or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: The result is very low quality food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the result is inmates going to the
cafeteria, getting their food presented to
[SPEAKER_03]: them, eating the cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rest gets tossed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we very quickly got into this
composting work.
[SPEAKER_03]: An image of what we were trying to do the
first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, these are final crown size.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get any access to bring in full
size trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we bought bare root seedling trees and
grafted trees in order to start
[SPEAKER_03]: implementing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just an image of what it looks
like the first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't be much information here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see the stakes are where we're
putting the trees and mulching it with
[SPEAKER_03]: grass clippings and leaves and fresh
compost we'd made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where we got by May.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see then, a lot of this is
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for another day, the whole thing of
bringing nutritious food into a place with
[SPEAKER_03]: the cafeteria dynamics, like I described,
is going to have its own excitations and
[SPEAKER_03]: conflicts laden into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we start getting into this drought
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually kind of devastating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a drought right around a
lockdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we couldn't go out there and water
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't let inmate movement back to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is where you start getting
triangulated by all these constraints.
[SPEAKER_03]: It must have rained one day and someone
took a photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only photo I have looking that
way that ever was taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is that building where they make
cardboard boxes, the greenhouse here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see we're starting to put
compost piles out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the lockdown continued that year
and the drought continued, you can see the
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow beds represent beds that basically
tanked when it got too dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The irony of our waterlogged soil having
been drained properly, we had to find some
[SPEAKER_03]: other activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I worked with the construction
class when they wouldn't let our students
[SPEAKER_03]: move.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually produced proper compost
bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get a sort of rebounding of the
garden when they let us back out there in
[SPEAKER_03]: September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's a frost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, now you've got to imagine,
I've got a good six months or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's USDA zone five, so probably seven
months, in which it's not reasonable to
[SPEAKER_03]: think that you're going to have much
productivity if you plant plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: We started dividing up the garden beds and
offering the men opportunities to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: compete with each other to do better
designs for the different sections of the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had competitions for the spaces that
were common.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird things like this showed up on the
computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was made with MS paint, I think,
and cut and paste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't know how Mr. Stilson did
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This won the competition, not because it's
reasonable, because this looks like water
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what that would do for
the flower and crab apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even sure what species he thought
we were going to plant here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is pretty two dimensional.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea was we want a picnic table,
a table, and to try putting some elevation
[SPEAKER_03]: to one of the trees, because people like
sitting on these little stoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that then made it into the design.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually started kind of doing this
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up with river birch as the
species we were trying for there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can kind of see as we're going
along here that a lot was developing in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say, for another day,
there was a whole project of Illinois
[SPEAKER_03]: exporting me across the state to implement
our composting system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the composting thing was huge,
because of the tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars of waste expenses that the
facility incurred, and this being a way to
[SPEAKER_03]: process things back into the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started using the construction
classroom, which was abandoned,
[SPEAKER_03]: to produce cement pavers by hand,
and to teach the dynamics of construction,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Portland cement, and aggregate,
and all that stuff, and get these things
[SPEAKER_03]: out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could walk through the prairie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see this was supposed to be
getting designed as a Japanese garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of ideas, and Cornell
University offered me a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we stopped.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, I needed to get out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've heard me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving you, actually, a fairly
sanitized version of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was grading psychological work for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working every weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was constantly bringing in books,
PDFs, trying to get clearance through a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of people that didn't want me to do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't recommend anyone do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing the Superman thing,
the sort of martyred teacher trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: make it possible to do this thing in the
impossible environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I left, a lot of my students had
also done this educational academic work
[SPEAKER_03]: with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, what are you going to say
when you leave here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm going to say this is my time
in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to get into the system and make a
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're still hated here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a bunch of messes with what
this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lockdowns and for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a satellite image.
[SPEAKER_03]: They mowed it after I left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm told.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is supposedly September of 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still see some shadows,
which suggests that maybe some shrubs
[SPEAKER_03]: there have survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see the paper stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the curly river.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could say a few things about the
other stuff we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can ask me more about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So other responses to some of these
challenges I've laid out to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this greenhouse simulation type of
thing I did with grow lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to make labs work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Design competitions, practice exams,
and student-produced field guides.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've maybe seen one of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally don't love these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it makes a lot of sense to do it
without the lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you've got nothing but vertical
space, this is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is in an all-cement room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got two of these things on that
state budget based on the fact that I used
[SPEAKER_03]: the logic of good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the state to give me an
appropriation to buy two of these things
[SPEAKER_03]: and give everyone two trays of plants they
could mess around with in the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would engage the students in the
real study of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a student from Cameroon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We studied the flora and fauna of
Cameroon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started growing baobab trees from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these trays declared that there would
be a baobab bonsai garden anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got, I should say, cold frames.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put cold frames there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also in other places in the garden
that we would walk by as a way to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: get movement and try to truly normalize it
at the facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm showing this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing this one because you see these
things on people's desks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not out of glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were peanut butter jars that
people would buy in the commissary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guys would scrub them clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not really allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But somehow they ended up in the
classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm doing there is, people should
be familiar with this, the soil shake
[SPEAKER_03]: test.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old trick to introduce people to
soil particle size.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shake up a sample in some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sediments out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can use the soil triangle and give
some approximation of what type of soil
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the type of thing I would have
to do is figure out what could happen
[SPEAKER_03]: through this and what could happen through
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just giving examples from the soil
class because this happened to be one that
[SPEAKER_03]: I had at hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually did soil pits, dug them,
and checked out the different
[SPEAKER_03]: stratification of soil layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would take heads of the soil home,
photograph it because there's no cell
[SPEAKER_03]: phones in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no cameras available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it home, photograph it, and add it
into the worksheet so people could see
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're getting at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all these other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be surprised to hear you can't
have a piece of string.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have a piece of metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But imagine what it looks like to get a
bunch of inmates to dig a 60-inch soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right next to the fence of a prison inside
of two watchtowers with a hose sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: around that you could throw over the
fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get an image of my world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to explain that to a bunch of
correctional officers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks that were using the Excel thing
started to offer to make crossword puzzles
[SPEAKER_03]: every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we're in soil here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this would be an entire week
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd trade it off and do a kind of blind
review of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, OK, we got this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was actually widgetized within the
Excel thing so that when you type in wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: letters, it would give you the sense that
you got them wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some kind of winning of the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Field guides.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was another thing that, again,
keeping the students occupied in
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughtful activity all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We allowed the students to produce this
field guide thing in PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're getting late.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one birch tree in the entire
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bring in images that would show it
was actually there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a section header.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is no frills PowerPoint field
guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a plant you saw all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are always kind of amazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even touched on the fact that
most of these guys are coming from urban
[SPEAKER_03]: areas where there's not a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say the name of the plants on
the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was always like, Doc knows way too
many plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was a way to kind of say,
bring in a picture of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to compete with you,
Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to know these plants,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the weed section, you'd see
purslane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people particularly loved it that this
was a semi-edible plant or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also ubiquitous in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The animal one is actually really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of this animal diversity
only showed up because of the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity that we had with the perennials
and the drainage regime and doing
[SPEAKER_03]: different things to make habitat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not intentionally for the animals,
but as a side effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a short list from an early
version of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an animal that is ubiquitous in
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also in the prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even to have this in a prison
environment where you could hear and look
[SPEAKER_03]: at and learn the name of and the habitat
of animals that you're seeing in great
[SPEAKER_03]: flocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm talking about you got
dumpsters of wasted soy food for inmates
[SPEAKER_03]: covered with crows every morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people don't know if it's a crow or a
grackle or a starling or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a real moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was probably the most interesting
moment of the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we had that drainage change and we
got that lake going, crawfish returned to
[SPEAKER_03]: the garden probably from there from
hundreds of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow they were hanging out in the
drainage ditches, I suppose, around the
[SPEAKER_03]: prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone was staying in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear this holler go up, there's a
lobster in my garden bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the watchtowers are like,
everyone hold still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: But so obviously, this was a way to sort
of codify and make it into a learning
[SPEAKER_03]: moment when these things would come
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding these things in your garden bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a good thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want this bug in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are worm castings?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all over my garden bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put a lot of compost in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the final thing I'm going to
say about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll just do a wrapping
statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We basically had, you can't see the cursor
here, but this is a hypertext.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, absence of computer literacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real liberal education.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to just give a career tech
class.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can teach writing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can teach genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through that, introduce to people to
reading PDFs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be email, other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, hypertext.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could click on the word crawfish
and you'll go to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could click on the word earthworm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll go to that slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks were actually getting a very
elementary introduction to how the
[SPEAKER_03]: internet works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been in prison since the 90s?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have never lived in a society that has
cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just think about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get housing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get a job?
[SPEAKER_03]: Computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just imagine what folks are facing when
they come out of this environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Closing comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were attempts to bring horticulture
education into prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said at the beginning, the point here
was not that I was trying to develop a
[SPEAKER_03]: special prison education that is totally
different, but rather an education that
[SPEAKER_03]: would be to the greatest extent possible
the same as a good horticulture education
[SPEAKER_03]: would be at a decent quality college
campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really only know of one other program
that got as far as the Danville Project in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of including a pedagogy of
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Sustainable Prisons
Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to visit it when I was at Evergreen
State College in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: But none of the other projects I've seen
have been as hands-on in the practice of
[SPEAKER_03]: food production while simultaneously
introducing an academic body of scholarly
[SPEAKER_03]: research and building ladders of
opportunity that lead up to a university
[SPEAKER_03]: education and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The limits to what was possible here were
largely the consequences of my decision to
[SPEAKER_03]: work inside the prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for various reasons, while there are
different limits, I'm inclined to say the
[SPEAKER_03]: better point of leverage is to work from
without the prison system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do think that is the proper place
for universities to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we find the work of the
Cornell Prison Education Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I welcome your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're welcome to contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us that may be unfamiliar to
you, could you describe how the university
[SPEAKER_00]: was out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that different from this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the main thing is, frankly,
the psychological turmoil is much lower
[SPEAKER_03]: for someone that at least can come back to
campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: At all times, and can have a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, that's what the Cornell Prison
Education Program has provided is a sense
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're not in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason we're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fundamentally, we're trying to create a
culture of learning, provide opportunities
[SPEAKER_03]: to people who are willing to work,
who apply to our schools, to gain a
[SPEAKER_03]: positive credential that will be with them
for the rest of their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prisons are about, these people have been
caught doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to detain them and constrain
what opportunities they have and give them
[SPEAKER_03]: a permanently negative record for the rest
of their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to be different from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of a dialectic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can try to have a spot where there is a
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But working there, I felt myself becoming
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of really don't know how else to
put this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what happened to those other
teachers that I've described.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even talked about the GED
teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've got classrooms that have
been turned into a piece of the prison
[SPEAKER_03]: interruption because of the bad power they
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to run a program like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that's the place that
universities will ultimately find
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves best positioned to do real
research on what else could be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fundamentally sign you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to be able to publish
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to be able to talk
about anything when you get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentioned to Don when I started.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really put the fright into you of
police power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was very hesitant and skittish to
say anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The repercussions would have gone to my
students, who I want to see turning into
[SPEAKER_03]: those other guys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other question?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Portland garden-based learning,
we work with folks statewide in a number
[SPEAKER_01]: of settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guidance to folks whenever we
begin working with them is to start small,
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a really stellar job with something
really small, working with everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: across all the layers of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do a beautiful job, you can always
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just watching this, I'm both like,
wow, and tired out from the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to do it again and looking
back on what you called yourself the
[SPEAKER_01]: Superman approach, what would you do
initially and do just an absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: stellar, thorough, thoughtful,
amazing job, knowing all the rest can
[SPEAKER_01]: follow if you have a successful
experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you begin again?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you briefly repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this question is, given how extensive
and Superman-like I was attempting to be
[SPEAKER_03]: here and that I burned out and ultimately
left, sorry, because I couldn't find
[SPEAKER_03]: another job to get out of this,
what would you say to someone else who's
[SPEAKER_03]: coming into this?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do differently?
[SPEAKER_03]: And would it be worth it to consider a
small, good success instead of a big
[SPEAKER_03]: burnout?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that you've really got some
insights there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And candidly, I was really trying to
provoke the edge between the very tight
[SPEAKER_03]: environment and the liberal education
interest and seeing being a contributor to
[SPEAKER_03]: justice reform.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things, I would refuse to take this
job if they didn't give a winter break,
[SPEAKER_03]: a spring break, a summer break,
and some off time for the students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly in the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be fine to be that intensive for nine
months and had to be a nine-month
[SPEAKER_03]: appointment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted it to be 12 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I worked the day before and after
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked December 24th, January 31st.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys are abandoned by just about
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of us here know this,
who are from the prison program.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you leave those students in the
prison, it can be emotionally hard to do
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it became a way that I dealt with
it was to just dive in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The better thing would have been to say,
let's have a period of rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give folks a book and let them get a rest
so that the teacher can prepare them for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also start off with a curriculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically developed this curriculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know how much it is just to develop
a syllabus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically developed nine courses over
those first six months that I then got to
[SPEAKER_03]: repeat twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The teaching load was absolutely
unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And community colleges are often guilty of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot to do with their budget
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I handed this off to another person
who took this on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gave every single PowerPoint
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had actually book onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had set up a situation like this so you
could do overhead projections.
[SPEAKER_03]: The library was intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cold frames were there, locks and
security in the tool room, the grow
[SPEAKER_03]: lights, the tools, two inmates that were
assigned to be assistants to the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that person went on after two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least if I had started there,
I think it would have been interesting to
[SPEAKER_03]: see if I'd made it five years doing this
instead of two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have, even in the Cardinal's
program, there's a kind of dynamic here,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is there's a lot of time a founding
group that rarely extends them so far,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then is also very exposed because the
facilities and the correctional folks see
[SPEAKER_03]: those individuals as having pushed it too
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you'll see the initial group kind
of pull back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another group kind of makes something
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: This program still exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the current teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know they've got those computers
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got some version of what we
started in those two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really moved by your work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm wondering if you have any hope for
shows like Orange is the New Black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that could kind of galvanize
people towards prison reform efforts just
[SPEAKER_02]: by bringing it more to the mainstream
media and letting people see the
[SPEAKER_02]: microaggressions and things that you're
talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the media has played a big
role in the past years of launching
[SPEAKER_03]: portrayal of carceral spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'd be an example of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pluses and minuses to that show.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're really in these places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people think the one person
they've seen is representative of the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so any writer or any person like me
can fall into that fallacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that there's a lot there in
just because I know I haven't seen the
[SPEAKER_03]: series in full.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know there's a habit of going back
and showing where these stories started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you heard almost everyone that I've
got a story about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like starting at the age of 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting at the age of 15 when the first
incarceration occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's hard for us to blame our own
12 and 15-year-olds for everything they do
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're obviously making bad
choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so similarly there, I think some of
that work is actually really good in
[SPEAKER_03]: building some semblance of empathy between
groups that probably don't meet each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even better, I think, is programs like
Cornell's program, which this semester is
[SPEAKER_03]: sending over 100 people into three
correctional facilities to actually do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To actually know these books.
[SPEAKER_03]: To actually know what's going on when math
phobia kicks in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you realize, I'm actually going to
college, and I just have a real
[SPEAKER_03]: psychological barrier around algebra.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't get a college degree unless I
get past this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's some folks from Cornell,
a totally different community than me,
[SPEAKER_03]: a totally different level of access to
resources, coming in anyway and saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to send you a tutorial.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bring in undergraduates
that can help you with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to let you do it a second
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this pass fail first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making it possible and giving folks
the chance to decide whether they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, you learn the personality of
the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learn the life stories of folks
through all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not there as personal counselors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that that actually,
there's a movement for college and prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the reason the White House was
interested in this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the White House,
this Wednesday, one of our former students
[SPEAKER_03]: talked with the Secretary of Education
about the future of this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because we need to bring people
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that shows can try to do that,
but there's also, sometimes they laugh at
[SPEAKER_03]: that show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sorry, sometimes they can't tell
why people are laughing at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because that character is trying to
be tragically sad?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a quirky way of presenting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we laughing at them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're being humiliated.
