[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermyer Gardens will go right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermyer Gardens is located in Yonkers,
New York on the Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a city-owned park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started the Untermyer Gardens
Conservancy five and a half years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: which operates in a public-private
partnership with the City of Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 1920s, this garden was called
America's most spectacular garden in the
[SPEAKER_01]: national press.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a very large mansion that was
built at the south end of the property
[SPEAKER_01]: during the Civil War by John Waring,
who was the largest manufacturer of hats
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went bankrupt about 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the estate was sold to Samuel Tilden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Samuel Tilden was a governor of New York,
ran for president of the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: and like Al Gore, won the popular
election, but was denied the presidency
[SPEAKER_01]: through the Electoral College.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, he retired from public life
and spent much of the remaining years of
[SPEAKER_01]: his life up here in Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1899, the estate was purchased by
Samuel and Minnie Untermyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Samuel Untermyer was born in Virginia in
1858.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Jewish.
[SPEAKER_01]: His father died right after the Civil War,
and his mother had a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she moved the family up to New York
City, and she bought a tenement and ran a
[SPEAKER_01]: kosher boarding house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a brilliant child, became a lawyer,
probably around the age of 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: 21, and one of the most successful lawyers
in America, the first lawyer to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars in a single legal case,
which in 1910 was a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a brilliant investor and became
very, very, very extremely wealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around 1912, he had made so much money
that he decided to do pro bono work for
[SPEAKER_01]: the public benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the head of the Pujo investigation,
P-U-J-O.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which looked at the concentration of
wealth and monopolies in few hands in the
[SPEAKER_01]: American economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He very harshly interrogated John D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockefeller.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also very harshly interrogated J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a long animosity with J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of Christians at the time,
J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan was a pretty anti-Semitic guy,
and they didn't get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan had a very famous pastime,
which was breeding collies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he always won the blue prize for the
best collies in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Samuel Untermeyer decided that he was
going to breed collies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a national competition
between the Morgan kennel and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermeyer kennel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these articles back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bubble in the collie market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that collies cost like $200 to buy a
baby collie in 1910.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost like $100,000 today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had a lot of ill will towards J.P.
Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really raked him over the coals in
1912.
[SPEAKER_01]: J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan said some things that were very
self-incriminating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The national press left onto J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan, made him out to be this terrible
robber baron.
[SPEAKER_01]: He left the country, went to Rome,
and he died a few months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Morgan family held Untermeyer
responsible for the death of J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no sooner did Morgan die than
Untermeyer got rid of his collies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had no interest in the dogs whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and his wife were very, Minnie
Untermeyer was very important to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: was Christian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have someone who was Jewish marrying
someone who was Christian in 1880.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very progressive people.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, like a lot of women, wealthy women at
the time, was in favor of women's
[SPEAKER_01]: suffrage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big parade on 5th Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, however, was one of the few men in New
York State, which has the largest suffrage
[SPEAKER_01]: movement in America, to help fund this
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were ten men in New York who helped
make this very critical movement succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also the lawyer for a man on the
right named Herman Bernstein, who was a
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known journalist, who was accused by
Henry Ford, who owned a newspaper,
[SPEAKER_01]: of being in league with the Protocols of
the Elders of Zion, which was a really bad
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-Semitic accusation that was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sued Henry Ford, and Henry Ford had
to shut down his newspaper, and Untermeyer
[SPEAKER_01]: was his lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 1916, so a hundred years ago
this year, Untermeyer bought another
[SPEAKER_01]: mansion next to his property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he decided he wanted to build a
garden, a really nice garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, again, his competitive nature,
decided he wanted to hire the same
[SPEAKER_01]: architect who had designed the Rockefeller
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also had designed the whole
renovation of Kaikid.
[SPEAKER_01]: William Wells Bosworth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at this picture,
that's the forecourt at Kaikid,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can see the Fountain of Oceanus in
the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wonderful letter from the 1950s,
from Bosworth many years later,
[SPEAKER_01]: to John D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockefeller Jr., saying that Samuel
Untermeyer walked into my office,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he asked me to design the finest
garden in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the level of ambition that
Untermeyer had.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had 60 full-time gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had 60 greenhouses on 150 acres on the
Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what the garden layout was like
in his day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mansion was actually that had been
already built before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermeyer's creed was on the far left.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Broadway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Croton Aqueduct, which runs
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what Untermeyer called the Greek
Garden, which is actually a Persian
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vista, you'll see pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The six-color gardens on the right next to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next to that were the Italian gardens
were connected all at the bottom with a
[SPEAKER_01]: series of gardens, Rose and Dahlia
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Near the mansion was the Temple of Love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Near that was the Sundial Garden and then
the Rock Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were all linked by a mile-long
carriage trail that went mainly to the
[SPEAKER_01]: south, but also on the north side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mansion is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carriage house is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The walled garden remains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vista remains.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge hospital is on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another hospital was built on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the street where he had more land,
including a dormitory for gardeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: is now a housing project and a nursing
home also in the northwest corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the walled garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The walled garden is the finest Persian
garden in the western hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Persian gardens, as you may know,
are the oldest gardens known to man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go back to like 500, 700 BC,
maybe 1,000 BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oldest Persian garden, for which we
have archaeological evidence, was built by
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyrus the Great in 550 in what is now
Iran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyrus was probably Zoroastrian,
and it's based on the concept of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Eden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see in the garden is a
criss-crossing water course, which defined
[SPEAKER_01]: four quadrants, often surrounded by a
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the remnants there in Iran.
[SPEAKER_01]: These Persian gardens, again, based on the
Garden of Eden, is a common concept to
[SPEAKER_01]: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the book of Genesis, like on page
three of the Bible, it describes the four
[SPEAKER_01]: rivers of paradise, the Tigris,
the Euphrates, and two other rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the word paradise is Persian.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Persian language, paradisa means
surrounded by a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a garden that's surrounded by the wall
that has these four criss-crossing water
[SPEAKER_01]: canals are the signature features.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iran, of course, becomes, Mohammed is
born, and it becomes Islamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these gardens become Islamic gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a garden that was built around
1,000 in Shiz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting about it is,
of course, it's surrounded by a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a criss-crossing water course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unique to this garden,
so this is not a typical feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The circular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see the wall here.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the crenellations on the wall in the
primary major entrance tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is the facade at Untermeyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the great, the crenellated
walls here, the great central entrance
[SPEAKER_01]: tower, and then the corner towers,
which are an Indian development.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look here at the entrance tower,
there is a relief of Artemis over the
[SPEAKER_01]: front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Artemis is the goddess of the hunt
associated with nature and fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people think of her as a Greek
goddess, but before she was a Greek
[SPEAKER_01]: goddess, she was a Persian goddess.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk through the gates,
you're like walking through the gates of
[SPEAKER_01]: paradise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, now Bosworth is going to take
you through Greek classical architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a wonderful amalgam of Persian
and classical Western design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people talk about, like,
Palmyra today, Palmyra is a moment in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle East where you see these two design
elements coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you walk through the gate here,
notice that there's a big block of stone
[SPEAKER_01]: over the entrance and a triangular block
over that with an element open to the sky
[SPEAKER_01]: up above.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a reference, an allusion to the
great Malian's Gate at Mycenae with the
[SPEAKER_01]: block here and the triangular block above.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that the opening through the
roof is a reference to Zoroastrian
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoroastrians have had burning fires,
and the smoke sometimes went through the
[SPEAKER_01]: roof of temples.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the garden looked like in
Untermeier's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, again, had bought a mansion there,
had torn it down, and there were
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-existing trees that Bosworth wanted to
have cut down, and Untermeier couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: bring himself to cut down the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are actually forest trees that
are in the middle of the path.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this interesting combination of
order but pre-existing disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to Persian gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Persian gardens, with the advent of
Islam, spreads with Islam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to Spain, the Alhambra,
of course, is also one of the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens in Europe and also a Persian
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice the Crenelated Tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This does not have four rivers,
although there are four rivers elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I show this here because of the basin
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come to Untermeier,
it's the same basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have three of these marble bases,
which are the support, which are the
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of the ancient rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ancient rivers also symbolize in Islam
the four rivers of life, water,
[SPEAKER_01]: milk, honey, and wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four quadrants defined by the four
rivers symbolize the four elements,
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, air, fire, and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also symbolize the four cardinal
directions, north, south, east,
[SPEAKER_01]: and west, symbolizing the availability of
paradise to the whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rhythmic planting that we have planted
here along the inner canals, they
[SPEAKER_01]: symbolize the souls of the saved in
paradise, whose roots are nourished by the
[SPEAKER_01]: rivers of paradise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the whole cosmic interpretation
of this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting to me is that
Bosworth designed a Persian garden for a
[SPEAKER_01]: man who was Jewish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is totally my own interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably it's subconscious, if that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the great period of great gardens
being built in the early 20th century,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you could count maybe on one hand
the number of great gardens that were
[SPEAKER_01]: built for someone who was Jewish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, pretty much everybody was
Christian back then in terms of the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who were building gardens and who had a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And isn't it interesting, if you were
Jewish, like in 1880, your synagogue
[SPEAKER_01]: likely would have been Moorish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Central Synagogue on Lexington Avenue
in New York City, or Eldridge Street
[SPEAKER_01]: Synagogue down on Lower East Side,
that Moorish architecture, that Moorish
[SPEAKER_01]: period in history, how much Muslims,
Jews, and Christians created a cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance in medieval Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wonderful that this garden,
this Persian garden, which you could say
[SPEAKER_01]: has a Moorish quality to it, was built for
Samuel Untermeyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Islam, of course, moves east.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into India.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the great mogul gardens are also
Islamic Persian gardens, of which the most
[SPEAKER_01]: famous one is the Taj Mahal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the floor plants here,
this is the Taj, main entrance tower,
[SPEAKER_01]: the four rivers of paradise, the four
quadrants with the corner towers here,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are in Indian development.
[SPEAKER_01]: This garden, interesting enough,
was open, walled only on three sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the tomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open on the four side looking out to
the river in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Untermeyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a central entrance tower,
the four corner towers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than the tomb, there's an
amphitheater, the four rivers of paradise,
[SPEAKER_01]: east quadrant subdivided into four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this also is open on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The left-hand side, no wall, open to the
Hudson River here, in which there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: temple, a classical temple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of it taken last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plantings change every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted elephant ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking out at the end towards the
amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice the paired columns with sphinxes on
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture during the height of the
Depression when Untermeyer was reduced to
[SPEAKER_01]: like 36 gardeners, not the 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gardens were open to the public one
day a week for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other major garden in America
that we know that was open, private
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, open to the public on a weekly
basis was Longwood, the Dupont Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Longwood was way out in the
country, so you had to have an automobile
[SPEAKER_01]: to get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This you could get by streetcar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take a train.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're five miles from New York City,
so many, many, many, many people came to
[SPEAKER_01]: visit these gardens, which were world
famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go through the gardens,
architecturally, Bosworth has taken you
[SPEAKER_01]: through the classical orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: The East Stoa, which is beautifully
planted with a riot of tropical plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: is Doric, which is the beginning of
classical Hellenistic architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking down back towards the main
entrance gate, where there are two
[SPEAKER_01]: magnificent weeping beech trees,
about 90 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, in Paradise, they're two named
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil, and the tree of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just take your breath away when
you step into this garden of Eden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a planting of a few years before
that, looking diagonally, crossing the
[SPEAKER_01]: rivers toward the crenellated wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little, the rhythmic planting,
alternating with rhythmic little tripods
[SPEAKER_01]: of vines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looked like in
Untermeyer's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the second year that we had
planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just started planting only the inner
rhythmic planting, not the outer rhythmic
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you see the paired columns with
sphinxes on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an allusion to the Bobli gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Florence, go to the Bobli gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're paired columns with Capricorns on
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice what's in the distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Fountain of Oceanus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Bosworth did is he took the
Fountain of Oceanus, he put it at Kaiket,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he took the paired columns and put
that at the Untermeyer garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he took the garden and split it into
two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have Capricorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have sphinxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sphinxes were carved by Paul Manship,
who was one of the greatest early 20th
[SPEAKER_01]: century American sculptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, there were two bronze
sculptures of Diana and Actaeon,
[SPEAKER_01]: also Manship, who sculpted the Prometheus
Unbound at Rockefeller Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mini Untermeyer, as I said, was Christian.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was president of the American Society
of Poetry.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a great friend of the New York
Philharmonic, brought in Gustav Mahler to
[SPEAKER_01]: become the conductor of the Philharmonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He became very ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took him to the boat in New York to go
back to Vienna to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was very close to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had many great social events there,
including one in 1924.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at the Democratic National
Convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,800 people invited for a dinner party.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge monsoon that hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a flotilla of buses that were
going up Fifth Avenue on Broadway up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Yonkers, and it was a disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people eventually arrived.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another mansion that Untermeyer
had bought, and they all crammed in this
[SPEAKER_01]: mansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, the rain stopped,
and they came out, and Eddie Cantor
[SPEAKER_01]: performed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was on the front page of the New
York Times top left-hand section,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the amphitheater, there is a
magnificent stage in Mosaic.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left is a reference to Mycenaean
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the Mycenaean Gate on one side and
the Mycenaean stage at the other at the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor of the amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are mosaics throughout the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to have the largest outdoor
array of mosaics in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture that was taken two years
ago when we did Marigolds honoring the
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian heritage of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marigolds, if you're Indian, go to an
Indian wedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have garlands of Marigolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw that movie called The Last
Marigold Hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did this magnificent planting of all
different colors of Marigolds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Untermeyer's day, he was very famous
for his chrysanthemums, and he draped
[SPEAKER_01]: chrysanthemums over this basin,
and we can't afford to have 60-foot-type
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners trimming the chrysanthemums in
greenhouses that no longer exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just planted potato vines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which gives that feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were the last year's planting of the
elephant ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the side loges, each plank,
the amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we have beautiful
aquatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the distance are papyrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Papyrus in antiquity is what you made
paper out of, which you rolled into
[SPEAKER_01]: scrolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to relate horticulture to
architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have actually, this is
another allusion in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Shalimar in India, which has this
beautiful sort of slot of water going into
[SPEAKER_01]: a pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have at Untermeyer is this
slot of water going into the pool here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the papyrus, which relate to the
Ionic capitals, which are scrolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the man-ship, the sphinx,
half lion, half eagle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go into a Persian garden,
you're supposed to be overwhelmed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: beauty and the senses of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to smell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to hear the birds crying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to see the fish swim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have beautiful fish that swim all
through the canals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have the outer rhythmic planting
has been completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fastidious beaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnificent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when we were doing our marigolds
two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the distance, you can see one of the
corner towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, an Indian evolution in the Persian
garden design.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the center of the main temple is this
mosaic in which there is a Medusa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bosworth said he selected Medusa
because she was the offspring of two
[SPEAKER_01]: marine gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this referred to the canals,
the four rivers of paradise and the Hudson
[SPEAKER_01]: River.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was giving a tour one day and there was
a classicist on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she taught classics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, have I ever heard of the
Aegis and Medusa?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, well, if you were a Roman
soldier, often you would go into battle
[SPEAKER_01]: and you would carry a shield, which often
had Medusa stamped on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would protect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was so ugly, she'd turn your foes into
stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But around the Medusa, there was a
circular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was called the Aegis,
the circular collar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a symbol of power and strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's very unusual about this setting
is that the mosaic is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a temple that's round that's
open to the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she was saying is that Medusa is
on the floor of the pavement.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's looking up to the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Zeus, this Aegis, was a great
symbol of power for Zeus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that she was looking up to Zeus and
Zeus was looking down to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the whole temple itself became
the Aegis, which is a spectacular image of
[SPEAKER_01]: the heavens and the earth coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the Axis Mundi, where the
whole universe comes together,
[SPEAKER_01]: the center of power in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very powerful image.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking through the Weeping Beach
to a 350 foot long mixed border of
[SPEAKER_01]: perennials and shrubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This showed it on the lower left.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looked like when we
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few lonely junipers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looked like after about a
year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: This on the left is what it looked like in
Untermeier's day with 60 gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mass plantings, ripped out,
put back, ripped out, put in several times
[SPEAKER_01]: a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have this permanent,
much more permanent border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the tower in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another shot looking back to the
temple of the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Untermeier's day in the lower right,
when it was bedded out with
[SPEAKER_01]: chrysanthemums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another shot, sort of late summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a shot looking, again,
when we had the marigolds, looking across
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the rivers towards the Hudson River
in the distance, which you can't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tower where we planted fastidious
sweet gums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marco Polo-Stufano was involved in this,
thought this would be a good way to
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasize the verticality of the tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's wonderful is on the wall we
planted three types of ivy, which are all
[SPEAKER_01]: intertwining and growing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very elegant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking through diagonally at a
magnificent atlas cedar, which just looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go down to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next level we've now bedded it out
with, again, mixed herbaceous,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with an emphasis on hydrangeas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably 60, 70 different types
of hydrangeas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is after one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the temple overlooking the
swimming pool looked like in Untermeier's
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible mosaics in total ruin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But magnificent mosaics, all with sea
creatures embedded in them based on Roman
[SPEAKER_01]: villas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go down those stairs on the
next level, there's a loggia to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other great parties that
took place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an event that took place in 1922.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dancers in the foreground here are the
Isadora Duncan dancers performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the beginning of modern dance in
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice they're in bare feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The orchestra is over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the conductor, Isadora Duncan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dancers posing elsewhere in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hear about all these people
visiting the garden one day a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, oh, well, a lot of people
came.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say, right, you just can't
believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think of it like it's an old wives'
tale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you can research the New York
Times archives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this little headline was from 1939,
October 29, a crowd of 30,000 persons
[SPEAKER_01]: today visited the Free Flower Show in
Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Superintendent revealed that many of the
visitors came from foreign lands in
[SPEAKER_01]: distant parts of this country,
as well as the city, to see all the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional policemen were necessary to
facilitate the movement of the traffic of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Albany Post Road and movement of
sightseers in and around the gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go down to this level,
again, that's that loggia on the right
[SPEAKER_01]: where the people were standing during the
dance performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Bosworth does is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes you down to that lower level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in front of you is this low parapet,
a low wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no gate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a gate on the left, but that's
where you came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you figure you've got to go there
without really knowing why you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Untermeyer and his wife went to Europe
every summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they loved to visit gardens and to see
things and to buy sculptures and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had gone to Lake Como.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at Lake Como, there's a villa which is
now a very, very, very fancy hotel called
[SPEAKER_01]: the Villa d'Este.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the Villa d'Este, there's a feature
there that he loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked Bosworth, can you design
something like that for me in Yonkers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bosworth, of course, said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the garden in Lake Como with
cypress trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Lake Como with the mountains in
the distance with this wall stepping down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are in Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermeyer Gardens was called one of the
two most monumental gardens in America's
[SPEAKER_01]: second only to be built more in Asheville,
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Untermeyer's favorite feature of
the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 150 steps going down, descending
down towards the Hudson.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were lined with cryptomeria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were completely overgrown with Norway
maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we came here, we had to cut down a
massive amount of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have just last fall planted
cryptomeria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're beginning to recover what
Untermeyer had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you see not Lake Como.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than the mountains,
you see the Palisades, which almost
[SPEAKER_01]: imitate the proportions that you see in
Italy without, of course, the Italian
[SPEAKER_01]: cypress.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get to the bottom of the vista,
you see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are ancient Roman columns,
2,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are monolithic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made of single blocks of stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the greatest ancient columns in
the Western hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were from the estate of Stanford
White, the great architect who imported
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was murdered in 1906.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow they went somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bosworth must have heard about them,
persuaded Untermeyer to buy them and to
[SPEAKER_01]: drag them, however they got these huge
shafts of Cipollino marble there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are an absolute archaeological
treasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're made of Cipollino,
which is the same marble that Bosworth
[SPEAKER_01]: used for the columns holding the sphinxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: His columns are new.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are old.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are much bigger than his.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to make monolithic columns
without joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So parallel to the vista was another chain
of gardens, which were called the color
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were six gardens, each a
different shape, many of them with
[SPEAKER_01]: fountains, each planted in a single color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a white garden, a blue garden,
a yellow garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you were going down the vista,
imagine the tall cryptum area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you can do is see the straight shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you start hearing water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you say, well, there must be
something over in the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be these little gaps in the
cryptum area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sort of go through the cryptum
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you come to this other world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see a whole other chain of
gardens, all axially aligned with stairs
[SPEAKER_01]: going down the hillside.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the round basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: About four years ago, most of the color
gardens are owned by the hospital next
[SPEAKER_01]: door.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of went up those stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking for that round basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to dig down about 12 inches in
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right-hand side, I found that
round basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in negotiations with the hospital
to try to effect a land swap where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: get back three of the color gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get three.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have five of the six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the parking lot, we can move
elsewhere on land that we don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was never a garden there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will take many years to do,
including an act of the New York state
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the bottom color garden looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started, it was completely
overgrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically just digging things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dug up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dug out the fountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We removed all the fallen trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no garden there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look down from that round color
garden, you see the truncated elements of
[SPEAKER_01]: what was this probably 1,000-foot long
mixed border going north-south.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rose and dahlia and other gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the ruins of a pergola that's
there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just cut this back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The view to the left of the river you
could not see last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look to the right, it looks like
you could be anywhere here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no view whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we strategically cut down two trees and
got this magnificent view of the Hudson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you came back, actually,
from that long 1,000-foot garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was another 1,000-foot garden going
the other way, which we call the long
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are two gardens which slid past
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking back towards the ancient
columns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a period photograph, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll be years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that weren't enough, parallel to
the color gardens were the Italian
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Italian gardens were ornamental
vegetable gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also had a Persian element to
them in that they stepped down the
[SPEAKER_01]: hillside and there were these rills,
R-I-L-L-S, that were lined in cobalt blue
[SPEAKER_01]: tiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the 1990s, they don't exist
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nursing home that's been built
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went and I dug there and I found the
cobalt blue going through this devastated
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's looking north up to the Tappan
Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we go down to the bottom,
there's the old Croton aqueduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have now just erected a mile-long
deer fence around much like 33 acres so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can begin to plant things that will
survive with the deer being on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the beginnings of that deer
fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the ancient columns on the
upper right and then the lower on the
[SPEAKER_01]: left, the gatehouse, which is about ready
to collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do emergency
stabilization literally to prevent it from
[SPEAKER_01]: collapsing because we want to create a
ruined garden there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to replace the windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to put a roof back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a garden that you go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look up to the sky and it'll be
part of a whole ruined scenario in
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look through the gates,
you can see two sculptures, animal
[SPEAKER_01]: sculptures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, I think I have a better shot of
them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lion on the right and a headless
horse on the left attributed to Edward
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark Potter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who sculpted the two lions in front of the
New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue
[SPEAKER_01]: and 42nd Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the lion, you can go to the right and
you begin this very gradual ascent of a
[SPEAKER_01]: carriage trail about a mile long,
which would have left you, dropped you off
[SPEAKER_01]: at the mansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this takes you to the wooded part of
the property, which is more rustic and
[SPEAKER_01]: very hilly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The culmination of the south part of the
garden closer to the mansion is the Temple
[SPEAKER_01]: of Love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temples of Love were very popular features
in the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Temple of Love is a round temple with a
wrought iron dome on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is built on top of this incredible
boulder-esque fantasy that was sculpted,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was made by a man named Carlos Davite
from Genoa, Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Genoa a couple years ago and I
went in some of the municipal parks and I
[SPEAKER_01]: saw these huge boulders put together and I
could see where his expertise in that came
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did work at the Paris Exposition,
the St. Louis World's Fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the Pebbled Pathways at the Frick
Museum and I think I'm quite sure he did
[SPEAKER_01]: work at Kyket, but this is much grander
than anything he did at any of those other
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is viewed from above.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now just a week ago dismantled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the process of restoration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting in all new plumbing and
electrical and this will open to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public for the first time in 75 years with
all of its waterfalls and cascades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we had to dig things out,
trees obscuring many aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it there to the left and it bears a
strong resemblance to the Temple of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sybil in Tivoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these precedents lurking in the
mind of the architect, very interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of it during the day,
like in the 20s, the temple on the upper
[SPEAKER_01]: right and there are these cascades going
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had to be complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely rebuilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were totally shot, but the main part
of the temple with the big boulders up
[SPEAKER_01]: above were in good shape and could remain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only photograph that we have of the
waterfalls working during Untermaier's
[SPEAKER_01]: period was this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Irma Duncan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irma Duncan was one of the dancers from
the Isadora Duncan dancers and they came
[SPEAKER_01]: back again in 1933.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an architect so I can appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fundraiser that Untermaier gave
to raise money for unemployed architects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this was a fabulous shot of her
and there we can see the waterfalls going
[SPEAKER_01]: down and there were three waterfalls and
then a big cascade going down below that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boulders are placed in such a way that
there are all these nooks and crannies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've counted roughly 313 planting
pockets, so all riddled throughout are
[SPEAKER_01]: these planters, each of which has a
drainage hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably had five full-time gardeners
just maintaining all these planting
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are so high up you're going
to have to be like a rock climber to get
[SPEAKER_01]: up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the gardeners are going
to water it or weed them, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable work of masonry and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then adjacent to that was a rock garden
and this is completely covered with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was totally unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Washington to the Smithsonian
archives and I saw these pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, where are these pictures?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We studied and studied and we saw a trace
of a line in a geological map that showed
[SPEAKER_01]: where a path had been.
[SPEAKER_01]: We figured out it must have been at a
certain place and we started digging up
[SPEAKER_01]: and removing trees and we found the ruins
of the rock garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looked like in
Untermaier's day, one section of the rock
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the path, the bench here and this
weird totem pole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found little fragments of the bench
here and this stone, which is where that
[SPEAKER_01]: totem pole stood.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looked like in
Untermaier's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like now,
another project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then adjacent to that was another feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermaier loved the fact that 30,000
people came here in one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loved the fact that everyone was
writing articles about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would follow people through the garden
and listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would listen to their comments and if
they misidentified a plant, he would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, it's da-da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would have the Latin name and the
common name just so he wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early 30s, he decided he wanted to
build the world's largest living
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural sundial.
[SPEAKER_01]: He built this weird thing, which is an arc
made out of evergreens, plants planted in
[SPEAKER_01]: Roman numerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a photograph of him setting his
watch by the sundial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say a little bit about Samuel
Untermaier, the Jew.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1921, Albert Einstein came to America
to raise money for Palestine, what is now
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel, and for what became Hebrew
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermaier was the man who showed Einstein
around New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: He introduced him to his friends and they
really hit it off and he raised a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Einstein was so impressed with Untermaier
that he sent him a letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a copy of it in German saying,
I'm worried about what's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1921.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I wire you money that you will
invest for me in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: All through the 20s, Untermaier was
investing this pot of money for Einstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he would go with his wife to Europe
every summer, they would visit with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Einsteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1933, 12 years later, Adolf Hitler
comes to power.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just come out of World War I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people did not want to get involved
in another war with Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jews especially did not want to raise
a fuss because they didn't want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into something that they think of as a
Jewish war.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jews were trying to assimilate in
society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't trying to stick their necks
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Samuel Untermaier became the president of
what was called the nonsectarian anti-Nazi
[SPEAKER_01]: League.
[SPEAKER_01]: He became the face of resistance to Adolf
Hitler all through the 30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was well into his 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He traveled all over the country speaking
against Hitler.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of what was trying to cripple
Nazism through an economic boycott that no
[SPEAKER_01]: one would buy or sell anything that was
manufactured in Germany and to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: expose Nazi propaganda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went to his old friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to Percy Strauss who owned Macy's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Macy's was selling all this stuff that was
made in Germany saying, you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: selling this stuff that's made in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Percy said, I don't want to mix economics
and politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he went to the Salzburgers who owned
the New York Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had been their lawyer for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to place a full page ad in the
New York Times talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of the boycott and how bad
Hitler was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1934.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Salzburgers wouldn't take his money
for the ad because in the ad he said that
[SPEAKER_01]: there were a number of prominent German
Jewish department store owners who
[SPEAKER_01]: continued to sell goods in their stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not saying which stores, but people knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the biggest advertisers in the
New York Times were probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: department stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he went to Einstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Einstein happened to be in America in
1933.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got the job at Princeton, spent the
rest of his life at Princeton.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to Einstein and said, you are a
poster child for a German Jewish refugee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should tell the world what is
happening in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Einstein also said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he wanted to help humanity with
the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to work on refugee issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until 1940 that Einstein stepped
up to the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is that in the early 30s,
Antrimer was called by the national press
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitler's bitterest foe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nazis were very worried about what
Antrimer was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They followed his movements very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to have a bodyguard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, he got so old that he had to
withdraw from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, he did not prevail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Militarily, we had to defeat Germany
without the boycott.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've selected this not because of the
Reichstag, but because of the photograph
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a picture of Robert Moses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, lair and bleakly ask aid of Moses
and Antrimer dilemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1939.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the year before Antrimer dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has this great garden which he feels
should be a public garden for the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he tried to give it to New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met with Robert Moses to see if he
would give 150 acres, everything to New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State as a public garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too ornamental.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too slopey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't put in football fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he offered it to Westchester County
as a county park.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he offered it to the city of Yonk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the largest landowner in Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said no way, because all that land
would go off the tax roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next year he dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They opened up his will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's offered to New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Offered to the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Offered to the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took Yonkers six years to agree to
accept 16 acres out of the 150 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the walled garden and the vista.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Various hospitals were built.
[SPEAKER_01]: The housing project across the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, a big portion of that land was
not developed where the Temple of Love is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went through a series of developers who
were going to build all these housing
[SPEAKER_01]: projects there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all went bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the Open Space Institute's
intervention in the 1990s, late 90s,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was able to be reacquired by Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the acreage went from 16 acres to 43
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died in 1940.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was 82 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the front page of the New York
Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of great men, he might not have
been the greatest father in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was saving the world and doing all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Human dynamo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had three children.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no interest in the garden
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this beautiful fountain in front
of the mansion that he bought in Berlin in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late teens maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The children gave this to New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Central Park at the Conservatory
Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever go in off of Fifth Avenue,
like 104th Street, you go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanderbilt Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the right, and there's this
beautiful fountain with a close
[SPEAKER_01]: resemblance to the Isadora Duncan dancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was originally in front of the
mansion in Yonkers, now in Central Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge auction of his
belongings, including many elements from
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden, 1940, a few months after he
died, including this important Greco-Roman
[SPEAKER_01]: sculptured marble torso of Aphrodite from
the 3rd through 2nd century BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a picture of it on the left in the
East Stoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know where it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge article in May of that
year in the New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It talks all about Untermeyer and Allen's
garden, about the ancient columns,
[SPEAKER_01]: his incredible life.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 1960s and 70s in particular,
the whole area went through a real
[SPEAKER_01]: downturn, sort of a hippie era.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the high point of the hippie era was
when John Lennon paid a visit to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Temple of Love.
[SPEAKER_01]: The low point of the hippie period was
David Berkowitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of you who are old enough to know,
1976, he was a mass murderer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He murdered eight women and terrorized New
York City once.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came from Yonkers and hung out at
Untermeyer a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ruined state, it's degraded state,
he kind of related mentally to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something we're proud of,
but it's part of the history of the park
[SPEAKER_01]: and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the 70s, the park, I never saw this,
but this is what it looked like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the canals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a total wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big restoration effort in the
70s which bought it more time and did some
[SPEAKER_01]: good work, although it quickly relapsed in
the 80s and 90s when I saw it in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I lived in Yonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about six years ago, I went back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had not been there in about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had turned the fountains on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never seen the fountains going in
the 90s and it just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know what a Persian garden
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know Samuel Untermeyer was
Jewish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know any of this sort of stuff,
but I decided I was going to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: conservancy and I had been on the board at
Wave Hill where I lived two blocks from
[SPEAKER_01]: Wave Hill in the Bronx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marco Polo Stufano, the man on the left,
created Wave Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spent his whole career there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many would consider him to be maybe the
dean of American horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had retired in 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was retired and I told him about my
interest in Untermeyer Gardens and I asked
[SPEAKER_01]: him if he would be interested in helping
as a volunteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, it's an interesting story
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: His mentor was a man named T.H.
Everett.
[SPEAKER_01]: T.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everett was maybe one of the deans of
American horticulture in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught at the New York Botanical
Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Marco's mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to the 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Untermeyer had all these gardeners,
60 full-time gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was pretty frugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had an agent that he sent down to the
docks in New York Harbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When ships came in from England,
that agent would go down in this steerage
[SPEAKER_01]: and ask if there were any gardeners who
needed a job because the best gardeners
[SPEAKER_01]: came from England.
[SPEAKER_01]: T.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everett was one of those gardeners on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: His first job in America was at the
Untermeyer Gardens, T.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he rose up and became this big
muckety-muck.
[SPEAKER_01]: His prize student, the best student he
ever had, was Marco.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took Marco to Untermeyer in the 60s and
he showed him this ruined landscape and
[SPEAKER_01]: described all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in Marco's blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I asked Marco if he would be
interested in joining, he said,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, it would be coming full circle,
which is a fantastic story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timothy Tillman is the head gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now about ready to have three
full-time gardeners and three seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners, so we're well shy of 60,
but we're adding a gardener every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timothy was one of Marco's proteges,
worked with him at Wave Hill and is a
[SPEAKER_01]: human dynamo, fantastic worker,
and a very good eye, very artistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marco goes there a couple days a week to
consult with Timothy and bat around ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in conclusion, I want to say that you
can see that Untermeyer Gardens is not
[SPEAKER_01]: just about pretty flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a place that operates on the highest
level in terms of aesthetics, garden
[SPEAKER_01]: history, architectural history,
American history, even spiritual meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that a Jew married to a Christian
created an Islamic garden based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Edenic idea of peace and brotherly love
carries quite a wallop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This alone is incredibly interesting,
but there is much more to it when you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the lives of Samuel and Minnie
Untermeyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: From economic reform to women's suffrage,
American anti-Semitism and anti-Nazism,
[SPEAKER_01]: Samuel Untermeyer was consistently and
progressively on the right side of
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and Minnie was doing her part to
advance American culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a congruence between the lives
that the Untermeyers led and the message
[SPEAKER_01]: of this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Form and content are marvelous,
endlessly intertwined.
[SPEAKER_01]: How lucky we are that these gardens
survive in Yonkers and in the fullness of
[SPEAKER_01]: time can possibly stand as a symbol of
harmony for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's one more thing, one more
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the conclusion of my lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of you want to sign up on the sign
up thing, I'd love to get your names and
[SPEAKER_01]: addresses, but there is one more thing,
and this is just a brief drone video.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
