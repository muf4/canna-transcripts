[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light's the ultimate source of energy on
earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through photosynthesis, it provides us
with clothing, food, housing.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people that work with plants,
it's absolutely essential for germination,
[SPEAKER_03]: phototropism, flowering, pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it as a first principle in the plant
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, this is my high school textbook
for biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And light is the energy for life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes on to a chapter telling us
what is light at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did stage lighting in high
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my goal was, for those that are older,
to do light rock bands with chipmunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I did work on light and how it
activates cells with Peter Hepler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, we looked at everything
to understand it based on chemistry,
[SPEAKER_03]: physics, biology, history, and philosophy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see that approach here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Socrates said, follow everything to
the end, wherever it leads you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ended up becoming a plant cell
biologist and light microscopist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrote two books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both in their third edition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And throughout these books, I try to help
people understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, that's really important,
to understand light and cell biology based
[SPEAKER_03]: on chemistry, physics, history,
and philosophy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just came out last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And God said, let there be light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And God saw that the light was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's get in a little more detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Christian Huygens figured light was a
wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: It couldn't be a corpuscle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it was a corpuscle,
then if this person was looking at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bird and this person was looking at the
flower, the corpuscles would hit each
[SPEAKER_03]: other and just go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So light must be a wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Newton said, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light can't be a wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you take a human here and you
shine light on it, waves tend to go behind
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time you're walking by water and you
see a stick coming up, you'll see the
[SPEAKER_03]: waves go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Newton couldn't see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said, light must be a corpuscle.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what corpuscles look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what waves look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it can't be a wave and it can't be a
corpuscle, maybe it can be a particle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a wave or a corpuscle and a wave or a
particle or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'll come back to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thomas Jung actually repeated Newton's
experiment and found out that the light
[SPEAKER_03]: that hit both sides of the barrier
actually went around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Newton missed this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, my students do this every
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it's really easy with a laser and
very difficult with sunlight in England,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you don't get much brightness and
coherence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, this happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was evidence that light behaved as
a wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's light hitting two different holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out and they make a pattern like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Thomas Jung said it made this pattern
because when the crests came together,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd get constructive interference.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the crests were out of phase,
you'd get destructive interference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would account for the light and
dark bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Thomas Jung might have been kind
of bright because he started off doing
[SPEAKER_03]: botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's his first paper on opercularia.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So light seemed to be a wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: And James Clerk Maxwell showed that it was
an electromagnetic wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's how he showed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took Faraday's experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: He showed that when you move a magnet
through a coil, you create an electric
[SPEAKER_03]: current in that coil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So see my thumb?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the magnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my fingers are the current in the
coil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this symbol means.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you move a magnet up and down,
and around it, you get a circle or the
[SPEAKER_03]: curl of the current.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ampere showed that if you have a current
moving across an electric field,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will generate a magnetic field around
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This equation set, my hand is now the same
as the equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a current going this way,
make a magnetic field that goes around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody clear on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get past the vector calculus now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maxwell also assumed that the divergence
of E equals 0.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that there's no sources of
electric fields or no sinks for electric
[SPEAKER_03]: fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, there's no electric field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't light the carrier of the
electromagnetic force?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put that aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this here means that there's no
magnetic monopoles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means you can't have just a north
magnet without a south magnet,
[SPEAKER_03]: or south without a north.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that part's actually true.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maxwell's math was a little too simple
here, because this says as soon as you
[SPEAKER_03]: change the magnetic field, you get a
change in the electric field.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, there's no cause and
effect relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens simultaneous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a change in electric field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's instantaneous to get a change in
magnetic field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that shows up in his wave equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice that the electric and the magnetic
fields are in phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as we assume causality doesn't
count, Maxwell's wave equation is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's also assume that conservation of
energy doesn't count, because here you
[SPEAKER_03]: have 0 energy, maximum 0, maximum 0.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few flaws here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in Maxwell's equation?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to question these assumptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Einstein actually questioned the
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, we should remember that the
elementary quantum of electricity epsilon,
[SPEAKER_03]: I call Q, is an outsider in Maxwell-Lorenz
electrodynamics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fundamental equation of optics will
have to be replaced by an equation in
[SPEAKER_03]: which the universal constant epsilon,
probably a square, also appears in a
[SPEAKER_03]: coefficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not yet succeeded in finding a
system of equations suitable for the
[SPEAKER_03]: construction of the elementary electrical
quantum and the like quantum.
[SPEAKER_03]: The variety of possibilities does not seem
so great for one to have to shrink from
[SPEAKER_03]: this task.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you how I found the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's start from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning, there was energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the forms of energy,
the four fundamental forces, one was
[SPEAKER_03]: electromagnetic force.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it split and gave rise to matter and
anti-matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a symbol of a photon giving rise
to a particle and an anti-particle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called pair production.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is anti-matter in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bananas, which are full of potassium,
mostly potassium-39, have a sizable amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of potassium-40, which is radioactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it decays into argon-40 by emitting a
positron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a positron is a particle of
anti-matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's about one produced every 70
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, at Cougar Medical Center,
there's PET scans, positron emission
[SPEAKER_03]: tomography, where you take
fluorodeoxyglucose.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otto Warburg found out that cancer cells
ferment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't respire.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ferment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because they ferment, they need tons
of glucose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you give the body fluorodeoxyglucose,
and it goes right to those cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fluorine gives off a positron.
[SPEAKER_03]: The positron meets with an electron from
the cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives off gamma rays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have detectors that now can
localize the cancer using positron
[SPEAKER_03]: emission tomography.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last week, we heard that Margaret uses
positron emission tomography to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: grafting.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two complementary processes,
pair production, converting light energy
[SPEAKER_03]: into matter and anti-matter, and
annihilation, converting matter and
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-matter into light energy,
all based on equals MC squared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some of you must be thinking,
if light can turn into anti-matter and
[SPEAKER_03]: matter, and matter and anti-matter can
turn into light, could it just be that
[SPEAKER_03]: light is made out of matter and
anti-matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at what the big boys say.
[SPEAKER_03]: about matter and anti-matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something called charge parity
time symmetry, that if you want to convert
[SPEAKER_03]: a particle of matter to a particle of
anti-matter, what you do is you change the
[SPEAKER_03]: charge, you change the spin, the direction
of spin, and you change the direction it
[SPEAKER_03]: moves in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this is positive, positive,
positive, this is negative, negative,
[SPEAKER_03]: negative, product of this is positive,
product of this is negative, matter equals
[SPEAKER_03]: the minus of anti-matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who here has seen time go backwards?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start with the assumptions of a
scientist that what you see is pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: close to what's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily, but it's a great first
approximation.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've never seen, like, anti-matter
going backwards in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen mitosis or meiosis,
all those other cells that are made,
[SPEAKER_03]: come together and make one cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although 30, 40 years ago, I published a
paper in the Journal of Irreproducible
[SPEAKER_03]: Results that said I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are elementary particles mathematical
points, or do they have extension?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what is actually the definition of
matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Definition of matter is something that has
mass and extension, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Hooke wrote Micrography here in
1665.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's his microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I'm going to start this whole
field of microscopy like a geometry would.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start with a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he looked at the point of a needle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he saw how blunt it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had extension.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at a line next, like a razor
blade, and saw how un-line-like it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this brings us now to about 1900.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lord Kelvin, who actually came to
Cornell and said it's the prettiest campus
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world, gave a talk which was
entitled Nineteenth-Century Clouds Over
[SPEAKER_03]: the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in it, he said, the beauty and
clearness of the dynamical theory,
[SPEAKER_03]: which asserts heat and light to be modes
of motion, which is waves, is at present
[SPEAKER_03]: obscured by two clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: How could the Earth move through an
elastic solid such as essentially its
[SPEAKER_03]: luminous aether?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So water waves move through water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seismic waves move through rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound waves move through air.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do light waves move through?
[SPEAKER_03]: They move through the luminous aether,
luminiferous aether.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you figure out the speed of light
and the transverseness of the waves,
[SPEAKER_03]: that aether would have to be so viscous
that would have stopped the Earth from
[SPEAKER_03]: moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a real conundrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember how I told you that Maxwell
didn't put any of the electrical
[SPEAKER_03]: properties into his light wave?
[SPEAKER_03]: He put them all into the aether.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the little balls of the electric
current and the big ones are magnetic
[SPEAKER_03]: forces moving around in circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we had this aether that was thick
enough to stop the Earth from moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would carry the light waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after Michelson and Morley did
their experiment that said it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: matter which direction you move in the
aether, the speed of light's the same,
[SPEAKER_03]: Einstein said, then there must be no
aether.
[SPEAKER_03]: This must be people's imagination.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he banned the aether.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have no aether.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's some room for the quantum
mechanical photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one other cloud over 19th
century physics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was Maxwell-Boltzmann doctrine
that said that pressure is caused by
[SPEAKER_03]: molecules, which are mathematical points
moving and hitting the edges of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more you heat them up,
the faster they move and the more pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: they exert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would hold a certain amount of
heat based on these motions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you heat the molecules up and they move
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're using that heat up and they're
holding that heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were some molecules that held
even more heat than like helium,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a monoatomic gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like diatomic gases like hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it turned out that hydrogen held
instead of 3 halves kT of heat,
[SPEAKER_03]: 5 halves kT because they had rotational
motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can save that heat in rotating
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, there's vibrational motion
too in other molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, bromides too that has 7 kT of
heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more what's called degrees of
freedom you have, the more types of motion
[SPEAKER_03]: you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Translational motion, rotational motion,
vibrational motion, you can hold more
[SPEAKER_03]: heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything just didn't work like a
mathematical point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lord Kelvin wanted to point that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Wilhelm, sorry, I spelt that wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilhelm Wien wanted to apply Maxwell
Boltzmann moving of particles to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand black body radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: He figured the molecules inside the black
body were moving and as they were moving,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you heated them up, they'd move faster
and they'd give off higher energy light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seemed to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, this black line is the actual
data and the red line is his theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, all of us, as biologists,
we'd jump at this and we'd go out for a
[SPEAKER_03]: beer and celebrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But physicists really do know how to
measure things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Planck looked at this and said,
how can I improve this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Libitz, one of the inventors of calculus,
had the law of continuity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature doesn't do anything in jumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is continuous.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you read origin of species,
Darwin will say, nature does nothing in
[SPEAKER_03]: jumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although he says it in Latin, I will screw
it up so you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Planck assumed that just maybe if these
oscillators, these atoms in the wall,
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow discreetly sent out light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this was like a combination of the
atom and the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't like a photon yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a discrete thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he could model the black body
radiation perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the discreteness related to the energy
of that oscillator light combination,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was equal to what Boltzmann called
Planck's constant, times the frequency of
[SPEAKER_03]: the oscillation or light, or Planck's
constant, times the speed of light divided
[SPEAKER_03]: by the wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, speed of light equals wavelength
times velocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a frequency.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Einstein outplanned Planck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'm going to make light just a
mathematical point as discrete as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me that the observations
regarding black body radiation,
[SPEAKER_03]: photoluminescence, production of cathode
rays, on and on, everything you could see,
[SPEAKER_03]: can be understood better if one assumes
the energy of light is discontinuously
[SPEAKER_03]: distributed in space.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to this assumption to be
contemplated here, when a light ray is
[SPEAKER_03]: spreading from a point, the energy is not
distributed continuously over
[SPEAKER_03]: ever-increasing spaces, but consists of a
finite number of energy quanta that are
[SPEAKER_03]: localized in points, in space,
moved without dividing, and can be
[SPEAKER_03]: absorbed or generated only as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get a wavelength, which is a
length, in a matter mathematical point?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Millikan tested Einstein's idea
that if you shine light on a plate,
[SPEAKER_03]: electrons jump out, and you can measure
the speed of those electrons or its
[SPEAKER_03]: kinetic energy by putting a negative
charge here and preventing them from
[SPEAKER_03]: jumping off the plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did that, and he found out that as you
increase the frequency of light,
[SPEAKER_03]: you increase the kinetic energy of the
electrons, and the slope was exactly equal
[SPEAKER_03]: to Planck's constant, birth measurement of
Planck's constant.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Johannes Stark said, well,
if this light thing is a particle that's
[SPEAKER_03]: moving in one direction, it must have
linear momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know the energy is hc over
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: In mechanics, energy is equal to the
linear momentum times the velocity of that
[SPEAKER_03]: ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a light quantum, it would be e
equals pc.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a light quantum, the linear
momentum would be e over c, which is hc
[SPEAKER_03]: over wavelength c, which would be
wavelength over, I mean, Planck's constant
[SPEAKER_03]: over wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the linear momentum of a photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shorter the wavelength, the greater
the momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: X-ray would like that be over,
where a radio wave would just go through
e.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I want to do a little
calculation for you, because Einstein was
[SPEAKER_03]: really kind of screwy on his.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So classically, p equals mv.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a light quantum, p would equal mc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we know that e equals pc or p
equals e over c, then p equals e over c
[SPEAKER_03]: and mc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take this part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Move the c over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get e equals mc squared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, I just derived e equals mc
squared only from the mechanical
[SPEAKER_03]: properties of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: But e equals mc squared is kind of like
too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in classical mechanics,
the energy equals 1 half mv squared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for quantum, that would be 1 half mc
squared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where'd the other half of the energy
go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to answer that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard Beth measured the angular momentum
of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Angular momentum classically is the mass
times the angular frequency, angular
[SPEAKER_03]: velocity times the radius.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent polarized light through a
birefringent plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it rotated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he measured the angular momentum of
each quantum was h over 2 pi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, independent of wavelength and
frequency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same for every single photon,
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's angular momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the quantum mechanical photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a speed, a wavelength, a frequency,
an energy, a linear momentum, and an
[SPEAKER_03]: angular momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although since it's a mathematical point,
nothing's spinning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want you to forget
interference that Thomas Young,
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get too old.
[SPEAKER_03]: New.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as biologists, we know there's
morpho butterflies or beetles that when
[SPEAKER_03]: the light hits and goes through a thin
plate or separated points, you get these
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful blue colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get those beautiful blue colors as
long as this distance is less than about a
[SPEAKER_03]: wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have photons that are about a
wavelength apart, and you'll still get
[SPEAKER_03]: these beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be really difficult if light were a
mathematical point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because this is a plant biology
seminar, plants also use interference to
[SPEAKER_03]: make some of those beautiful blue colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so Einstein sort of neglected
interference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Planck, when he introduced Einstein for
membership, nominated for membership in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Prussian Academy, said, sometimes,
as for instance in his hypothesis of light
[SPEAKER_03]: quanta, he may have gone overboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The speculation should not be held against
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Niels Bohr in his Nobel dress said,
in spite of its heuristic value,
[SPEAKER_03]: however, the hypothesis of light quanta,
which is quite irreconcilable with
[SPEAKER_03]: so-called interference phenomena,
is not able to throw light on the nature
[SPEAKER_03]: of radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Millikan said, the conception of
localized light quanta, out of which
[SPEAKER_03]: Einstein got his equation, must still be
regarded as far from being established
[SPEAKER_03]: until it can account for the facts on
interference and the other effects which
[SPEAKER_03]: seem thus far to be irreconcilable with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must withhold our full assent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Henryk Lorenz said, the hypothesis of
concentrated quanta is directly in
[SPEAKER_03]: contradiction with observed facts,
namely that what is seen in the phenomena
[SPEAKER_03]: of interference.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then Arthur Compton did this great
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a pool table.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took a photon and shot it into an
electron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the electron went back, using up some
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the photon was scattered in this way
with a little longer wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you use conservation of momentum,
conservation of energy, and Einstein's
[SPEAKER_03]: special relativity, it all worked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compton got the Nobel Prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from then on, everybody believed the
photon was a mathematical point.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was working on my model,
I talked to Kurt Gottfried.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, there's nothing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science has changed, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science used to be a way to understand the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's a way to predict what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a fundamental difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm a pirate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can safely say, says Feynman,
that nobody understands quantum mechanics.
[SPEAKER_03]: David Merman here at Cornell declared
himself to be among those who feel
[SPEAKER_03]: uncomfortable when asked to articulate
what we really think about quantum theory,
[SPEAKER_03]: writing, if I were forced to sum up in one
sentence what the Copenhagen
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation says to me, it'd be shut up
and calculate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although just recently, Jim Baggett,
and unfortunately he died, Halbron,
[SPEAKER_03]: started to question this lack of free
speech in science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up and calculate how Einstein lost
the battle to explain quantum reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Einstein really questioned
quantum mechanics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He even questioned his point like photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wrote to Lorenz, I am not at all of the
opinion that one should think of light as
[SPEAKER_03]: being composed of mutually independent
quanta localized in relatively small
[SPEAKER_03]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tell my students, the most effective
tool for your career in science is to have
[SPEAKER_03]: a rug and a broom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's inconvenient facts,
theories, or whatever, you just put them
[SPEAKER_03]: under there.
[SPEAKER_03]: John F.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kennedy wrote in Profiles and Furrows,
The first pressure to be mentioned is a
[SPEAKER_03]: form of pressure rarely recognized by the
general public.
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans want to be liked, and senators
are no exception.
[SPEAKER_03]: We prefer praise to abuse, popularity to
contempt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are anxious to get along with our
fellow legislators, our fellow members of
[SPEAKER_03]: the club, to abide by clubhouse rules and
patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way to get along, I was told when I
entered Congress, is to go along.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the stairs up to our dean's office,
it says to be defiant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Defy disciplinary boundaries, ask new
questions, inspire pioneering solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just aspirational and not something
you should actually do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no sense of self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the Courage in Education Award for
being fearless when it comes to anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to tell you about my way of doing
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking here in the unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using my left brain and my right
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Left brain's trying to take things apart
and analyze them, get those facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right brain's trying to put them together
to make a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also turn around, and I look at the
past to see if that structure is as good
[SPEAKER_03]: as people think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, a tree may be shading all
those lateral buds that aren't growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the trees drop down, those
lateral buds have a chance now to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just looking at those lateral
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tensugi, and I recognize Makoto Fujimura,
is taking those old pieces that have just
[SPEAKER_03]: been laying around under the rug there and
getting some very fine gold and putting
[SPEAKER_03]: them together and making something that's
even better than the original.
[SPEAKER_03]: C.P.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snow said that no scientist or student of
science need ever read an original work of
[SPEAKER_03]: the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody read that April 1953 paper by
Watson and Crick?
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's bad advice, and you should go
read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm a simple man.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, infinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, can't do enough controls,
can't understand things, can't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not smart enough for this kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try to find the fewest number of
first principle ideas that I can put
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to really question the
assumptions to make sure they're true and
[SPEAKER_03]: coherent, non-contradictory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm challenging two assumptions that
the elementary particle is not a
[SPEAKER_03]: mathematical point and that time goes
forward and backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Benz-Ginsburg came to my lab, and it was
looking at the Carnot cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carnot cycle is a thermodynamic engine
that you heat it up, the piston goes up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cool it down, the piston comes down,
and it converts thermal energy into work
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no change in entropy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's as much entropy formed as there is
taken away in the cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no relationship to the order of
events in time and entropy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet you can only go clockwise in this
cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go counterclockwise to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an order of events in time,
even though there's no entropy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when Benz told me this, I said,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grabbed his arm, took him to the
physical science library, which existed at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time, put in a VHS tape of Feynman,
talking about the reality of
[SPEAKER_03]: antiparticles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what Feynman said was antiparticles
are particles that go backwards in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this machine were made out of
antimatter, according to Feynman,
[SPEAKER_03]: it should just run in the opposite order.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since I believe that there's only one
direction in time, and we published on
[SPEAKER_03]: this, I said there got to be a new
symmetry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of having positive and negative
time, let's have positive and negative
[SPEAKER_03]: mass and figure out all the mechanics and
how everything behaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I came up with a new symmetry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of CPT symmetry, substitute time
for mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it said that antimatter is the same as
matter, but the charge, the direction of
[SPEAKER_03]: spin, and the mass, the sign of the mass
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Negative mass is something that exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: In theoretical physics, this is Tommy
Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: His bondy who wrote this, Tommy Gold,
was at Cornell, and also initially helped
[SPEAKER_03]: me with my work on the photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with botanists, we know the plants
respond to gravity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know something about gravity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm dealing with negative mass,
I wonder how it works with gravity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Newton's universal law of
gravitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the causal force.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the response force.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little mass moves in response to the
gravitational force.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if you put these two together,
the little masses cancel out, which means
[SPEAKER_03]: the direction of acceleration depends only
on the sign of the mass of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that's positive, both negative and
positive mass will accelerate to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will accelerate to the Earth because
the attractive force, it goes the same
[SPEAKER_03]: direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This accelerates towards the Earth because
there's a repulsive force, but it goes the
[SPEAKER_03]: other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes towards the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we made up the situation of having a
negative mass of Earth, since that's
[SPEAKER_03]: negative, they'd both go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if you have two masses that are
exactly the same size, the positive mass
[SPEAKER_03]: would run away from the negative mass,
and the negative mass would be attracted
[SPEAKER_03]: to the positive mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd have this thing actually chase
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd look like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want, you could call it
massless.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the trouble is it would chase each
other to infinity, faster than the speed
[SPEAKER_03]: of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a problem because light only
travels at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked over to Ed Selpeter's office and
told him about my idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turned out he came to Cornell to
actually work on could the photon not be
[SPEAKER_03]: an elementary particle?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this had paper by Fermi and Yang had
just come out suggesting that mesons
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't elementary particles, but part
matter and anti-matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis de Broglie had postulated this
before, that the photon was made out of
[SPEAKER_03]: two semi-photons made out of matter and
anti-matter, but they were massless and
[SPEAKER_03]: electrically neutral.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plants have action potentials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the algal cells I have down my
lab were the first cells that were shown
[SPEAKER_03]: to have action potentials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday, I'm giving a lecture in
neurobiology on plant action potentials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know about plant electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thales took amber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody know the Greek word for amber?
[SPEAKER_03]: Electron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he took amber, rubbed it with fur,
and it attracted little pieces of straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Complete botanical experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Latin word for amber, succinium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Succinic acid was first isolated from
amber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can catch fossils in amber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cavendish made a torsion balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put these huge big lead balls and saw
how they attracted each other and
[SPEAKER_03]: calculated the gravitational force.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said actually he weighed the earth
from that, which in fact he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coulomb created a much smaller version of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of nine pound lead balls,
he used little pits from the elderberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've done anatomy, you might have
taken the pit plants that grows out there
[SPEAKER_03]: in the courtyard and used it to help you
suck them very light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he found out that the force of
attraction or repulsion depended on the
[SPEAKER_03]: charge and the distance between them,
as well as the contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: The constant has the electrical
permittivity of the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposite charges attract, like charges
repel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you divide the force by one of the
charge, call it a test charge,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get the electric field around a
charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric field radiates out from positive
charge in between them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between two charges, you get a very strong
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a charge moves, you make a magnetic
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: The faster it moves, which is the
velocity, the charge, the greater the
[SPEAKER_03]: magnetic field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another constant, magnetic
permeability, that gives you the
[SPEAKER_03]: quantitative difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have these two positive and negative
mass things that are moving together as a
[SPEAKER_03]: photon, but they're moving faster than the
speed of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to slow them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, the speed of light is equal
to inverse of the electric permittivity
[SPEAKER_03]: and magnetic permeability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some electrical magnetic
components there that may be important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a positive charge move,
or a charge moves, it generates a magnetic
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that magnetic field actually generates
an electromotive force in the opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: direction that slows this down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called self-induction, or the
electrotonic state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Maxwell said this is actually the
fundamental quantity in the theory of
[SPEAKER_03]: electromagnetism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have these two charges, two masses,
two charges.
[SPEAKER_03]: The positive charge moves away from the
negative mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as it moves away, since it has a
charge, it generates a magnetic field,
[SPEAKER_03]: which generates an electromotive force in
the other direction to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now this catches up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually get two particles in a
wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's kind of a model.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to talk about the rotational
motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: If E equals mc squared equals h nu,
then we calculate the mass of a photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we let the angular momentum equal
mvr, the classical quantity, and set that
[SPEAKER_03]: equal to the quantum quantity,
by doing this we use Niels Bohr's
[SPEAKER_03]: correspondence principle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since the angular velocity is equal to
the angular frequency times r,
[SPEAKER_03]: we get this equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from that we can solve for the radius
of a photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the radius of a photon is wavelength
divided by 2 pi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how wide it is, or half-wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have these two things that are
moving like this with angular momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each photon, for example, an x-ray,
would be tiny, kind of like a particle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And an infrared photon would be very wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the radius is wavelength divided by
2 pi, the circumference is 2 pi r is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually equal to the wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the fundamental wavelength in
a photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks messy, but it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the three-dimensional equation for
the movement of these semi-photons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the radius.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cosine means it's moving in a certain
way, or sine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to have a cosine and sine means it's
moving in a circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: To have a cosine and a minus sine moving
in a circle in the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this just says the semi-photons are
moving in a circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a vibrational frequency I had
to just create out of my own head to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure they didn't crash into each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they crashed into each other,
they turned into light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's difficult to see the three
dimensions, so I divided it now into
[SPEAKER_03]: resolve what it looks like as it's coming
to you or looking from the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody see the particles on the wave?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Schrodinger wasn't able to come up with an
equation for the photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could come up with one for electrons,
which is spin one-half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in his equation, this n equals 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made this n equal 2 for a photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the kinetic energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the potential energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the total energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to say you can solve
this equation if you make a wave function
[SPEAKER_03]: that describes your photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's my wave function.
[SPEAKER_03]: In essence, cosine plus i sine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes a certain amount of time to
go around the circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the wave function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it has this i in the imaginary number.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the imaginary number, people don't
use real space.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, I mean physicists, don't use real
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use what's called phase space or
configuration space or imaginary time.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I look at this as a transverse plane
where there's actually rotational motion
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pastor Wessel in 1799 was a mapmaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he figured out that he could use
imaginary numbers to make ordered piers
[SPEAKER_03]: with the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The x-axis gives you the longitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the real axis gives you the longitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the imaginary axis gives you the
latitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep two numbers that you can't add
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps them separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy for the bookkeeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the energy of the binary photon that
was twice as big as just the translational
[SPEAKER_03]: energy, you add the rotational energy,
and you get the full energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I just want to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coulomb's law to the wave equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the wave equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Coulomb's law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do it in the x, y, and z plane for the
two photons.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives us the electric field on each
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can sum them together to see what
the electric field caused by both are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I could do the same thing for the
magnetic field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here you want to use the velocity
instead of the position.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you get the velocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just show you in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them together, and you get the
magnetic field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine this is positively charged and
the blue one's negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, if they fly over this electron here,
they're going to add no electric field.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cancel each other out.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they widen and separate, they'll put a
little bit of electric field on here,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot, none, and then an opposite directed
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually have a sine wave,
an electric sine wave, going over that
[SPEAKER_03]: electron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what it looks like in vector
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pink wave will be the sinusoidal
electric field, and the green will be the
[SPEAKER_03]: circular magnetic field.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a quarter of a wavelength out
of phase in orthogonal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to hit an electron, boom,
send it up into another orbit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Einstein wondered what would happen if he
traveled at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Maxwell's equations, everything stops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Einstein concluded time must stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for here, it actually keeps going
because the two things are
[SPEAKER_03]: self-regenerating because they're out of
phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinusoidal electric field pulls an
electron up to the next orbital.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a hydrogen atom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the electron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Photon's coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adorption, very much like photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This Kirchhoff diffraction equation
describes how things look in a microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trouble is it's not consistent with
Maxwell's equations.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, if you have a spherical particle,
in a microscope, a confocal microscope
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't look like a sphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like this proloid form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kirchhoff's diffraction equation
describes this perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not consistent with Maxwell's
equations because Maxwell's equations has
[SPEAKER_03]: two waves that are in phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not allowed with the
assumptions of the Kirchhoff diffraction
[SPEAKER_03]: equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Poincare, Sommerfeld, Hans Bethe,
all said, Maxwell's equations don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody lets it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the binary photon has the two fields
out of phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a picture of the binary photon in
plain form in Maxwell's equations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have an electric field,
still have a magnetic field, have an
[SPEAKER_03]: electric field, magnetic field,
always.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with Maxwell's equations, they
disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they won't describe
diffraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: The point spread function is what we use
to tell the relationship between our image
[SPEAKER_03]: and reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the typical equations that are
used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, you can't find a derivation
for them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zeiss published them once.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's no derivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, they use different
functions to get the axial resolution and
[SPEAKER_03]: the lateral resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the binary photon, I can make use
just one function and just say that the
[SPEAKER_03]: axial is about three times greater than
the lateral resolution because the photon
[SPEAKER_03]: travels about three times more distance
than it is wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking the geometric properties of the
photon.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one cycle, the photon goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is pi times greater than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Polarized light is completely
understandable when you have a sine wave
[SPEAKER_03]: like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Photons have no dimensions, no sidingness.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't understand polarized light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a fiber cable from Tyfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one last thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Einstein predicted that starlight would go
by the sun and have what's called a double
[SPEAKER_03]: deflection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you turn the telescope up higher and
you see the star here, even though it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said it has a double deflection
because the mass of the sun warps both
[SPEAKER_03]: space and time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But think for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the photon from the star had zero
translational energy, it would just fall
[SPEAKER_03]: into the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it had infinite translational energy,
it wouldn't be bent.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that it's bent twice as much as
just a Newtonian corpuscle would be bent
[SPEAKER_03]: means it has the translational energy is
only half the energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other half is the rotational energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to say time,
space is together and warped and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just say that the photon has a few
more properties than Einstein gave it as a
[SPEAKER_03]: mathematical point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lorenz wished that physics would go back
so he can imagine things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And space and time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The young guy said, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think modern physics has definitely
decided in favor of Plato.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the smallest units of matter are
not physical objects in the ordinary
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are forms, ideas, which can be
expressed unambiguously only in
[SPEAKER_03]: mathematical language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those ideas have no extension.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a photon is a physical object.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has extension and could be pictured in
ordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Space and time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think on the surface, quantum
mechanics and relativity may seem to be
[SPEAKER_03]: profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: But deep down, I think they're
superficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mindy showed sweeping things under the rug
as opposed to using that as material for a
[SPEAKER_01]: testable hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not not derive testable hypotheses
from whatever you want to call the trash
[SPEAKER_01]: you were sweeping under the rug?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me give you my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, if you were to shut up
and calculate environment, there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: testable hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll give you one of my things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have these masses at the end of a
string.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the shape of those masses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say they're more than a mathematical
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the positive charge, say,
could push apart the other possible
[SPEAKER_03]: charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd split.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poincare say you need a Poincare force in
order to pull them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have that other force,
then what's the shape of the electric
[SPEAKER_03]: field?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it exponential or instead of linear,
as I showed it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called the Yukauer force.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are actually, if you have an open
mind, sweeping under the rug could just be
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting facts that need to be tested.
I'll ask the paper right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the early part of the paper today,
you mentioned that the matter into matter
[SPEAKER_02]: creates a possibility of the one chasing
the other, so translational motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: How in your model does the rotational
momentum and rotational motion come into
[SPEAKER_02]: play?
[SPEAKER_02]: The paper discussed translational motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do we get that rotation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how do we get the rotation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so angle of momentum is conserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once it's emitted, it's emitted with
one wavelength, and therefore,
[SPEAKER_03]: angle of momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can just say it as an atom,
a Bohr atom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each electron stays in its orbit because
angle of momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we have two particles,
but there's no.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the charge between those fields
that I showed you after you take into
[SPEAKER_03]: consideration the three-dimensional
charges that are there?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't really answer your
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a sort of a description of the
charges that are there, but not an
[SPEAKER_03]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to do that, or we can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you prevent them from hitting each
other?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that longitudinal motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually prevents them from ever touching
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I created that just on a whole cloth
in order to make sure they don't touch
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, it worked out kind of
nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entropy of a photon is 3.6k.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the entropy of a single particle is 1
half k.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you add degrees of freedom,
and you get more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 3.6k is basically 7 half k.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you look for seven types of motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there should be about seven types of
motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just sort of made up that
vibrational thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I originally had a much simpler formula,
but the photons wouldn't interfere
[SPEAKER_03]: constructively or destructively the way
you observe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to add a square, 2 pi square.
[SPEAKER_03]: Square term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosine squared instead of just cosine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really interesting talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, so the Super Conga and
Conga reactor in Japan showed evidence for
[SPEAKER_04]: free neutrinos that are free from
electrons and different flavors producing
[SPEAKER_04]: different halo effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these neutrinos are undetectable by
our sensors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except when they interact with another
particle, when they hit an electron and
[SPEAKER_04]: produce light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does your model account for the
production of light by a particle that
[SPEAKER_04]: moves faster than the speed of light?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we assume that light has a set
limit of its speed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then this particle couldn't be carrying
light faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the center of gravity of the photon
actually moves at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since it's vibrating like this,
it has to move faster and slower on both
[SPEAKER_03]: sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: The average is always actually the speed
of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the photon itself moves at the speed of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing about neutrinos, Max Born
initially and then de Broglie thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: once neutrinos were discovered,
that the two particles would be neutrinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since neutrinos may or may not have a
magnetic moment, it's not certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And may or may not have a mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is even more certain,
I think, than the neutrinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: These particles I'm talking about may be
similar to neutrinos, neutrino and
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-neutrinos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how would the interaction of a neutrino
with an electron produce photons in that
[SPEAKER_04]: case?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only answer very vaguely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is that if you have an interaction
that's going to lead to a certain energy
[SPEAKER_03]: production, that energy production could
give off a photon of whatever the
[SPEAKER_03]: particular wavelength should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't really answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
