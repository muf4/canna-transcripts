[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be here in beautiful
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first time at the Cornell,
so I'm very impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to tell you about the
research that I started in my lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vienna, and now I am continuing at the
SOC, which is essentially revolving around
[SPEAKER_00]: the question, why do roots grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do they decide to stop to grow or
continue to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I think it's very
interesting and important to study roots
[SPEAKER_00]: is because while we typically,
every day, we see the shoots of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: we think they are so important to fix CO2
and make air with the help of sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: into matter, into biomaterials,
without roots, they can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots, they mine the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take up the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to search the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They search for water and nutrients and
provide that to the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are a huge part determining
plant productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, root
architecture is very as dramatic or even
[SPEAKER_00]: more dramatic if you compare them to shoot
architecture that we see every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a beautiful drawing from Weaver
on prairie plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that actually it's easy to
distinguish species according to their
[SPEAKER_00]: root system architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have species that basically grow very
deep, and you have species that form very
[SPEAKER_00]: shallow root systems that explore the
upper soil areas much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big question is, what actually
determines these differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are these differences visible
between different species, they are also
[SPEAKER_00]: visible within one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the work that I will tell you about
today is done in this tiny model species,
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis thaliana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use this because there are so many
tools available for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can study the processes that matter
in the larger picture of evolution also
[SPEAKER_00]: within this single species because
different strains of these species display
[SPEAKER_00]: very different root phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have natural variation already
within the first two weeks of root
[SPEAKER_00]: development that you can see here,
just seedlings of five different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them grown on agar plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are accessions
that grow very slowly and accessions that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow much faster, accessions that put out
way more lateral roots, and accessions
[SPEAKER_00]: that put out less lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using like this model species,
natural variation within it, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually try to identify the genes and the
variance of those genes that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: determine those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will tell us how actually roots
grow, are basically genetically programmed
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in a certain direction,
to a certain depth, or stop to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to certain signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just alluding to the signals that
make roots grow or stop to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be nicely seen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just a five day, very early time
course is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see this very clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same accession because
Arabidopsis is a sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all isogenic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing here responses of the
same genome to different growth conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: where we either remove the iron from the
medium, or the phosphate, or the sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we reduce the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the same genome
actually responds very stereotypically to
[SPEAKER_00]: those environmental changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in iron deficiency,
this accession stops to grow very early
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some hypochortal
elongation even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then under a phosphate deficiency,
the same accessions actually grows
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a little bit faster than under
full medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that we can study both the
genotypic causality for different root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as well, look at the responses of
genotypes and of accessions to different
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to map the genes and identify the
mechanisms that are responsible to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe even to learn how this relates
to adaptation, we make use of a resource
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been built by Arabidopsis
researchers over many decades,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting in the 30s of the last century
when people started to collect Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a polar projection of mainly
the northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every dot here corresponds to one
strain of Arabidopsis that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: collected at some point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that actually,
actually, Arabidopsis grows as a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows from northern Sweden to southern
Spain, even northern Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows from the Atlantic coast into
central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that there are even Chinese
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, Arabidopsis has expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all over Eurasia and was
introduced later on to the Americas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these strains are available in
stock centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these strains have been
genotyped with high resolution SNP chips
[SPEAKER_00]: or even resequenced completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually start to draw the
genotype to phenotype maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can ask, are some alleles actually
distributed in a manner that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how that relates to adaptation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a method called genome-wide
association mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just briefly outline how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principle is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The statistics behind it are a little bit
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not necessary to understand this
in detail right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the principle is we measure a lot of
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say short root, like the length of
the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: We quantify this accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the genome sequence or the
genotype data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we try to correlate the
difference, the variation in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths between different accessions to
the variation in the genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do this all over the five
chromosomes of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, for every polymorphism that
we find, we can ask, do accessions that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a long root have a different
nucleotide at that position as compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions for the short root?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the accessions with a long root
have an A at this position and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions with a short root have a G,
this will be a very high correlation,
[SPEAKER_00]: very high association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can basically plot the
probability for this association over the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking for peaks where this
probability is so it's a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: logarithm of the p value is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially the plots you will
see today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started my lab six years ago,
it was actually very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part was actually getting very simple
because there were lots of labs who loved
[SPEAKER_00]: to sequence Arabidopsis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the labs of Detlef Weigel, Magnus
Nordberg, and Joe Ecker, they started
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing more than 1,000 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genotyping efforts had been on the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could just download this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that problem was solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was not solved in the association
mapping problem was largely solved as well
[SPEAKER_00]: by efforts from Magnus Nordberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was lots of activity in human
genetics to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the methods were actually well
outlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem actually is or was the
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to measure thousands, hundreds,
thousands of roots without making graded
[SPEAKER_00]: students jump out of the window and pure
because it's so horribly boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we developed was then multiple
ways to actually measure phenotypes as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as possible in an automated way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main pipeline, and that is all the
data that I'll talk today, is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow 24 seedlings on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we image them very efficiently
using a scanner cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can acquire 300 plants within three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have written algorithms that
actually transform this image and image
[SPEAKER_00]: like this into data which is outlined
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are virtual representations of
those seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this is all data, we can
basically measure everything starting from
[SPEAKER_00]: the root length to the angle at which
roots grow and to the shape of roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on using this pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no human intervention needed
for this step because those things work
[SPEAKER_00]: largely automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this pipeline, I think we have
quantified, I think, almost like 3 million
[SPEAKER_00]: individual images of seedlings in
different conditions from very different
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works very nicely for the first
couple of days for root development to
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify accurately and at a very large
scale phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also, but I won't talk about
this today, we also automated confocal
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy that we could actually get nice
confocal images, 3D stacks of images where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can actually measure cell size and
things like meristem size to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the area in which cells divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could also successfully use this to
map regulators of cell size and meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: size and where genetic variation is causal
for differences of cell size and meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about two
projects mainly, well, two and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: That illustrate, I think, nicely what we
can do and what types of questions we can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand using natural variation in our
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this all basically got started with
this experiment where we used around 250
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions and exposed them to different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just grew them on agar plates like
depicted as here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are, is one accession grown in
three replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show three replicates for each
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that, as I showed in the
movie before, that in different conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: when we drop out different nutrients,
we actually get a very different root
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did this for each of those 200,
around 250 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then can encode traits and colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we encode growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a yellow color means that there's high
growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A blue color means there's low growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of those rows here corresponds to
one accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically here you can see different
patterns of growth responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there are conditions like
iron deficiency where most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions do basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stop to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them stop earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue that already get blue on day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them stop later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically continue to grow despite this
deprivation of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there are some conditions where
basically some accessions basically
[SPEAKER_00]: increase their growth on day four,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some accessions decrease their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this response to the
environment is really dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because especially micronutrients like
iron will be in sufficient quantity
[SPEAKER_00]: already in the seed, this is most likely
not dependent on accessions running out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a nutrient, but rather an active response
to somehow a sensitive testing process
[SPEAKER_00]: that tells them there's basically less of
this nutrient around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that in this nice movie for
iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visualize very nicely this
different response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two accessions that grow the
same way in the full medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this accession basically stops their
growth very early on and then somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritizes the hypercortical growth a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this accession continues to grow to a
later time point under this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use this to then quantify this
and then ask, what are the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variants that are causing this difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first project that we started,
we started to phenotype 134 Swedish
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions from this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those had been collected by Magnus
Nordberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sweden is actually a very interesting
collection because within Sweden,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you think the whole of Sweden is
cold, there are differences in climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And northern Sweden is way colder than
southern Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also differences in soil
types and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it is a local population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mostly the same alleles will be present
in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easier to map common variation
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to demonstrate to you,
so when we did the growth on iron medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can find everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like almost always, there was natural
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the accessions, they actually
stopped very early their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them stopped late and basically
elongated longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we mapped this, we found
this one peak on chromosome 1 that was
[SPEAKER_00]: above our significance threshold that was
very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we then zoomed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this region, it was in a region,
the SNP was in the region of FRO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a major regulator of iron
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from a review where you can see
the enzymatic activity of FRO2 where it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically does this, catalyzes this
reaction from iron to iron 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, which then can be transported into
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that function has been known already a
long time and made it a prime candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: just based on its annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, we don't like to use
annotation for prioritizing candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: genes because there's always the danger
that you kind of wag your own tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you kind of think something plays a
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you look at the knockout
mutant, of course, most likely it will
[SPEAKER_00]: play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always typically take additional
independent data to assign more confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: to candidate gene before we go on a more
time consuming genetic characterization of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of this, we actually looked at
the expression level of FRO2 in those
[SPEAKER_00]: different accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't show the data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But FRO2 was basically, the expression was
increased in the accessions with a long
[SPEAKER_00]: root as opposed to the ones with a short
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was additional evidence for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the final test that you can do
is to take the alleles from those
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions and put them in the mutant
background if the mutant background shows
[SPEAKER_00]: a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so indeed, FRO2, actually under low
iron conditions, shows a shorter root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is we took the allele,
the FRO2 allele, from this short rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the allele from this long rooted
accession and an intermediate accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put it back into the mutant
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to, because it's a very
tricky business, because we're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with expression level differences,
because we don't want to be susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: random insertion expression events,
you can imagine that transgenes can insert
[SPEAKER_00]: in different areas of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might, by chance, basically just
confer a higher expression level or lower
[SPEAKER_00]: expression level because that can be
position dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of T1 independent insertions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phenotype in T1 based on a fluorescent
marker system selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be sure that we can actually average
out position specific insertion events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we did this, we actually see
that under iron deficiency, the root
[SPEAKER_00]: length was complemented much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the mutant transformed with the
empty vector in transgenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these hematogenic lines that
were complemented with this long root FRO2
[SPEAKER_00]: allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: While when we complemented with this short
root FRO2 allele, it didn't complement at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most likely because FRO2 is in those
accessions not expressed at that point of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made us confident to say,
actually, natural allelic variation for
[SPEAKER_00]: FRO2 is causal for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just another example where we
actually can go from the phenotype to the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene with genome-wide association mapping
very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the polymorphisms between those two
alleles are non-coding in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no change of the amino acid
sequence of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of changes in the
coding sequence that don't lead to an
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acid change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also some snips in the
regulatory region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all non-coding regulatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consistently with this, when we
measure in the lines that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: complemented to a better extent the
expression, it is much higher compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the short root allele of FRO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also completely
non-surprisingly true for the enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this higher RNA expression of FRO2
translates in a higher activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme that we can measure in this assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can really, like going from the
genetic variation over the expression to
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme activity, we can make the case
that this is more causal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting thing was when we're
thinking of natural variation that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: common natural variation populations,
it will be most likely related to
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, like growing on agar plates
in the first couple of days and growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer doesn't tell us so much
about effects that relate to fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically did the test that we grew
these complemented lines under alkaline
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, where iron availability is actually
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the allele of the FRO2
from the lines with the longer roots is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually much better in dealing with this
than the allele from the line with the
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that somehow gives the plants
an advantage to grow in iron-limited
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it matter when we look at the
places where the accessions come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map of Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the soil type that is
indicated by the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that when we look at the two
FRO alleles, one allele is the A allele
[SPEAKER_00]: pictured in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other allele is the G allele pictured
in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that most of the black allele
is actually in the north of Sweden,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are pot soils, which is a
specific type of soil that's highly acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: and where iron, for instance, gets washed
out very fast, while the other allele is
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly in the other soil types in
the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could give an indication that
actually the different alleles might be
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations to different soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not complete evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is very difficult to separate
population structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means those guys are way more
related among each other than those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: from adaptive features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to really test this, we would need to
go to Sweden and do reciprocal
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't done this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an hypothesis that this might
actually be the one FRO2 allele might be
[SPEAKER_00]: an adaptation, might be beneficial in pot
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of these stories and these
projects where we identified one gene and
[SPEAKER_00]: variants of the gene that is responsible
for a certain trait and for a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a couple of those in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, something that we know from
genetics, biology, is that genes don't act
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you often have interacting genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have multi-subunit proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, can we actually using
natural variation and the variants from
[SPEAKER_00]: these to identify more than one gene,
but rather pathways or modules of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that work together as proteins and are
important for regulating traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: biological functions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is actually one of the most
exciting applications of genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association mapping that I see,
because unlike a mutant screen where you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically really try to isolate the one
mutation, we are having to deal with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of many mutations that we have to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This you can see as a disadvantage,
because it makes things complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it also as an advantage,
because you might think that to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: one trait variation, you might target the
same pathway multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is so, it might be a very
important pathway for that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't tell you about this if I
wouldn't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you first need to do if you want
to consider multiple genes is you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: map multiple genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the key in GWAS is actually to
increase the number of lines you look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a statistical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did here was we increased the
number of lines where we measured growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate upon iron deficiency from the 134
that I showed you into typical 200,
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 lines that we typically use to almost
500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are way more
signals above the significant threshold
[SPEAKER_00]: than previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got more than 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can actually start to ask
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the genes that are close in immediate
proximity of those peaks possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting in the same pathway,
in the same module?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do this, we leveraged a genome
scale gene model from Aberdeen that's
[SPEAKER_00]: called Aranet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was basically generated by Insook
Lee and Sue Ries Lab at the Carnegie
[SPEAKER_00]: Institution a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it integrated all massive data types
that were available at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were expression data sets,
co-experimental expression from genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein-protein interaction data sets,
literature mining, and so on, in a
[SPEAKER_00]: probabilistic network model that
essentially depicts the probability of any
[SPEAKER_00]: two genes in the paradox's genome to
interact functionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we basically asked then,
when we took this network and asked if
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that were like immediate proximity
of those peaks were predicted to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional interaction, we actually found
quite some of those evidences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first looked at this,
this seemed to be most interesting to me
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was a leucine-rich receptor
kinase cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those four genes, we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the evidence codes in the
Aranet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these genes, it was actually
co-evolution, the evidence code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically a phylogenomic score that
gave us a safe rise to these potential
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we are currently
investigating if these genes are always or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in specific conditions are
co-expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so that was very interesting to
us because one emerging paradigm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field is that actually many of those
receptor kinases that typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are receptor kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a receptor domain,
leucine-rich receptor kinase domain,
[SPEAKER_00]: leucine-rich repeat domain outside of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thought is that they basically can
detect ligands outside of the cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: then activate the kinase to signal
something in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also thought that they basically
multiple LRR case can interact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane and even compete with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prioritize growth or defense or other
processes so that they are keys to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically receive signals and in a
combinatorial manner, then lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling cascades that affect growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just one example of,
I think, the best studied system from Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: and Corey's lab, mainly where the BRY1
leucine-rich receptor-like kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase,
interacts with others and leads to a
[SPEAKER_00]: differential interaction of a buck one
with either this kinase or this kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thought, the paradigm, is basically
now that depending on the interaction and
[SPEAKER_00]: the abundance of receptors, you might get
a different signaling output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the reason why I thought this
might be interesting because we have three
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor kinases here and one protein
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have leucine kinase that are downstream
of receptor kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might just be like a module
interesting to perceive the absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron and then lead to a different growth
response.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, very hypothetical,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is, of course,
because before we wanted to embark on a
[SPEAKER_00]: very laborious journey to study this,
was to see if we find any other evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: than this network evidence and the
seaworth evidence, whether those four
[SPEAKER_00]: genes might actually interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think of the data that we
already used for here, that's phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: data of accessions with different alleles,
we can actually think we can reuse the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and do a different test that is
almost independent of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in genome-wide association mapping,
we test for variation, like genotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and phenotypic variation for the
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do it one snip at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't consider multiple snips together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we think those genes and their
variants might interact, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: look for accessions that have certain
combinations of those four genes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: see if certain combinations respond very
different, non-additive, if you compare
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the other combinations where you
only have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you can do with the same
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can have each gene in a major or
minor allele configuration, if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify it to two versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can have accessions that have
either all of them in the major allele
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can have accessions that have all
of the four genes in a minor allele
[SPEAKER_00]: configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have everything in between.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is striking from this image is
that basically these higher order minor
[SPEAKER_00]: allele combinations all are fast growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the growth rate up on iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fastest growers are all
accessions that contain three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of minor alleles of those
four genes, with one exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the double combination for two
specific genes, FUR1 and SRF3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, to me, at least it was enough
to say, OK, let's spend some time to test
[SPEAKER_00]: whether this is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told Santosh, my postdoc,
just generate all possible higher mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it took a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get in the time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years later, we have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically the outcome of all
possible combinations of those mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the growth rate up on iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of the same nomenclature
as I showed you before with the variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like four genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the capital letter is the wild type
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the non-capital letter is the
mutant form.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go directly to the statistics
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to guide you through this
complex analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first good news was that,
and we knew that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested the single mutants before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the single mutants are
significantly different from the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a significant code for the
ANOVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can test the effect of singles and
of multiples.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that all of these receptor-like
kinases, so those are the three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the protein kinase are somehow
necessary for the appropriate response to
[SPEAKER_00]: iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, those three actually grow
much slower than wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one grows slightly faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we start with the interactions,
because that's our working hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_00]: those four genes interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one actually is very
striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most interesting and most significant
interaction actually occurs for those two
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor-like kinases, SRF3 and FER1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really epistetically interact,
because if you look at the single mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: for those two genes compared to the wild
type, they lead to a strong reduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth rate up on iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you combine those two mutations,
you actually get a lesser decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we would typically,
in the additive model, we would assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would get a growth rate around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we actually get a growth rate that is
reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a typical evidence for an
epistatic interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those genes truly genetically interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember the variant analysis
that I showed you previously, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same combination that we actually found
this dramatic increase already using the
[SPEAKER_00]: double in excessions that actually
harbored the double minor lead
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something special about this
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very primitive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my leucine rich repeat domain,
and it's the kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, too, somehow, it's a working
hypothesis, interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the membrane, they interact,
and they somehow regulate growth up on
[SPEAKER_00]: iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, is it actually true?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some evidence came, actually,
interestingly, at the time where we were
[SPEAKER_00]: still busy generating the double and the
triple and the quadruple mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the lab of Yousef Belkardia,
who was a colleague at the Gregor Mendel
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did an in vitro screen for 80% of
all leucine rich receptor-like kinases in
[SPEAKER_00]: the urbanopsis genome, multiple hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did an in vitro screen where he
expressed all of these and scored the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction using a color assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most notable interactions
was among the two receptor kinases that we
[SPEAKER_00]: found that were included in his assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So assay three and four one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gave additional evidence that they
might truly interact physically on the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also do, when we did the co-IP to
test this, so we basically pulled down
[SPEAKER_00]: first the one receptor kinase,
assay three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we pulled from this, pulled down
the other one with another tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we basically could show that we can
actually pull them down together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they are very close by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be another evidence that
they physically interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're currently doing more advanced
microscopy to test this using advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy methods like FRET.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that those two receptor
kinases interact on the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how does this relate to low iron
levels and growth response to low iron
[SPEAKER_00]: levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we treat reporter constructs,
that we express in tobacco with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: we basically still see a high abundance of
these proteins that are fused with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent protein here in the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we basically withdraw the iron,
we see that actually the signal gets much
[SPEAKER_00]: weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually see this when we do the
Western blot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same material, we can see that if
we treat with an agent that removes the
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, we lose this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the mechanisms that somehow
plays a role here is that if you have low
[SPEAKER_00]: iron levels, the receptor kinase will be
removed from the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interaction partner, when we did
the same experiment as here, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: observe any depletion from the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think actually in the context of
this receptor kinase module, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: two receptors that are interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then iron deficiency leads to the
removal of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this other one might be free for
interaction with other partners on the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we wanted to test if this is
really true in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were just tobacco assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we can do long term imaging,
we can actually do the same experiments in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is one of our experiments
where we track the root over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the same microscope, we have a two
chamber system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically add water to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we add furosine to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the signal that you observe here is
again from this one receptor kinase that
[SPEAKER_00]: we think is degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see under normal conditions,
the signal is quite constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth is quite constant of the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under iron deficient conditions,
you can see two very interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, the level of this
receptor kinase is much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somehow, there is an increase of the
signal again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more receptor kinase gets again
in the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the point of time when it
starts growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the abundance of this
receptor kinase correlates very well with
[SPEAKER_00]: growth under iron deficient conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this experiment more than 12 times
repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see very reproducibly that the
signal of the protein kind of stays
[SPEAKER_00]: constant under control conditions and
basically decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases much under furosine iron
deficiency conditions and then increases
[SPEAKER_00]: again at a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think the transient essays that we
did in Tobacco are really well
[SPEAKER_00]: representing that one of the effects of
the iron deficiency is to remove this
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor kinase from the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back to our power experiment
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually see multiple other
interaction terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, it tells us that there's
evidence from the genetics that all these
[SPEAKER_00]: four genes interact based on the mutant
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads to another very
non-sophisticated model that basically all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them somehow interact and that they
impact growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very happy when we got another
hint from Youssef Balcadier's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he had done this in vitro screen
of 80% of all the receptor losing rich
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat receptor kinases and abidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another interaction that he found with
fur, which is the second kinase that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had found that I showed you here,
was that it interact with a flagellin
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, FLS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a receptor that perceives
flagellin from bacteria and leads to the
[SPEAKER_00]: onset of the defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that made us to think that maybe we
found a model that somehow connects
[SPEAKER_00]: defense and iron deficiency signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing that we did
together with Youssef was to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of flagellin on the root growth of
the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the wild type, if you apply
flagellin here, you see a reduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth, because the root stops to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is abolished in the receptor
mutant, because there's no receptor to
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive the flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also abolished in the fur mutant,
which is one of our receptor kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somehow we have found that at least one
of these receptors that we found is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the regulation of growth upon
iron deficiency, but also upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of molecular signatures of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ROS response is one of the earliest
defense responses also impaired in this
[SPEAKER_00]: fur mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more evidence that there is a
connection between growth regulation under
[SPEAKER_00]: low iron conditions and under defense
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also see that if you look at
the growth of bacteria, basically the fur
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant is almost as much compromised as
the FLS2 mutant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know then that one of the components
we found is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, another receptor kinase of
the three we found, SiF3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also the one that I showed you
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: With its interaction with fur1 has also
been implicated in immunity in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: study before by Jane Parker, where
basically this mutation of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: different alleles lead to compromised
immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads to our current working model
that I want to share with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we actually have stumbled upon this
module here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the regulation of growth upon low iron
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know also that at least this part
here can interact with the FLS2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we actually think what's
happening here is that it's a module that
[SPEAKER_00]: processes signals from bacteria or
signatures from bacteria and iron
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance in the same module on the
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when there's iron deficiency,
so typically those three are in a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: under happy growth conditions,
no irons, no pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so fur1 is basically not available for
an interaction with FLS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the iron is going away,
and we think this might be in part
[SPEAKER_00]: perceived by this receptor kinase,
you remember the mutant actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: increased growth rate under iron
deficiency as if it wouldn't sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: the iron is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that SiF3 is actually degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two receptor kinases don't
interact directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fur is actually free to interact with
FLS2 receptor, which somehow leads to a
[SPEAKER_00]: stop off growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a working model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many open questions which we
currently solving by co-treating with iron
[SPEAKER_00]: and flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to corroborate this working
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what is known that there is a very
intimate relation of iron levels and
[SPEAKER_00]: defense that has been described in a very
descriptive manner in the past by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that actually might be a key
module.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what this nicely shows is that
you can leverage quantitative genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches to identify multiple genes,
get to interesting mechanisms that tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you interesting and novel biology,
and lead to basically a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how actually there's
crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing about this
crosstalk is that it seems to be entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: happening on the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the other question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this specific to iron?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we stumbled about this,
we were actually very, we were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were thinking, OK, so that's
just one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like this one intersection of the
response to micronutrient deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels in the environment and defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we then did other screens,
and we do a lot of screens, we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: found something very interesting in
collaboration with Hattem Rushed,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was at the INRAM one per year,
when we looked at zinc deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can see very nicely that
accessions also respond very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some accessions actually don't bother very
much, even increase their growth rate
[SPEAKER_00]: under zinc deficiency in the first couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them actually reduce their
growth rate quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we met this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a zinc deficiency-specific peak
on chromosome 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was located very close to the
AZI1 gene and other AZIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AZI1 gene is implicated in systemic
immunity and priming based on the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of Azaleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that already had been described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the prime candidate in this
region, because it's also expressed much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher upon zinc deficiency than all the
other genes in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we then used the mutant and the
overexpressor and conducted those growth
[SPEAKER_00]: assays under zinc deficiency conditions,
we actually see that the lack of AZI1 that
[SPEAKER_00]: is an immunity gene actually causes roots
to respond very differently to the zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seems to be specific to zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did the same assay with the
same mutant and overexpressor line,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no difference under iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did the complementation,
we could actually conclude AZI variation
[SPEAKER_00]: at the AZI locus is truly causal for this
different growth behavior under zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we took a long root allele,
and transformed it, a long root AZI
[SPEAKER_00]: allele, transformed it in the knockout,
it was much better complementing the short
[SPEAKER_00]: root phenotype under minus zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, of course, the obvious conclusion
or the hypothesis would be that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: an interaction between Azaleic acid and
zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the AZI1 gene is one of the key
genes that is required for the response of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to this immunity-related
signaling compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look under zinc deficiency,
we can see that basically the reduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth rate that we observe in wild
type with the application of AZA is
[SPEAKER_00]: abolished in zinc-limited conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this abolishment is largely dependent
on AZI1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think there is a complicated,
so that AZI1, so Azaleic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: immune-related signals are dependent on
the zinc status of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even thought, this is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what this means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that zinc and iron as well
are very, very important for immune
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in many systems, there is a kind
of war for iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also zinc is used for defense
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this simple interaction is also
conserved in different plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did the experiment in Rice
because it was in hand for a collaborator
[SPEAKER_00]: of HARTEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that actually this root
inhibition of root development,
[SPEAKER_00]: so when we increase the concentration of
AZA under normal conditions, zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient, we basically inhibit the
formation of the root completely or the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we remove the zinc from the root,
from the medium, we basically don't affect
[SPEAKER_00]: this process at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this interaction of zinc levels and
Azaleic acid and in abidopsis dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: AZI1 is truly somehow a process that's
relevant for many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big question is, why is it
actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but that's a question that I can't
answer right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just other than speculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I just go to the acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I've shown you that the ways how
we approach this problem using natural
[SPEAKER_00]: variation can tell us a lot on how roots
decide to grow or not to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it depends on genes and genetic
variance, at which levels and which time
[SPEAKER_00]: actually growth is stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And presumably defenses in those two cases
are basically defense responses are
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work was mainly done by,
so the iron-related work was done by
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandro Sudbay, a postdoc who started a
couple of years ago at the GMI,
[SPEAKER_00]: now came with me to Salk, which I'm very
happy about, was assisted by a master's
[SPEAKER_00]: student, very talented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part of the story was also
done by Sandro Sudbay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the work was actually done in
Hatem's Wilshed's lab in Ramon Perrier by
[SPEAKER_00]: Nadia Bouhain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what the mechanism of stopping
growth is at the growth level?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that the meristem basically
gets shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell division activity goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be signaling on the cell
cycle, by which means we don't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's like auxin-dependent or any
other signaling pathway we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, once we have all this,
we can actually test this using mutants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was very interesting that in
the absence of sulfur and phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: root growth speeded up or went past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you chose to look at the inhibition
rather than the promotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the reason for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you say anything about these
enhanced elongation rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also pursued the growth control and
phosphat, but with the iron, we were just
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the phosphat, we haven't quite
figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't increase the number of
accessions to have better mapping ability
[SPEAKER_00]: in phosphat, because the postdoc who was
working on the iron was faster doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not intentional design,
but rather the way how it is historically
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I'm currently doing at
Salk is that we are overcoming some
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecks for those studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major bottleneck is actually
pipetting hands right now to put the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: on plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm building right now a robot,
and we will do basically all these
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions with 1,000 accessions,
and we'll have much better mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: ability, and then can really, in phosphat
conditions, also consider this multi-gene
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so probably in five years,
I can answer your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm starting with a live question about
being a physiologist and being more
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with growing plants and
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing plants in the hygrids,
especially when they have dust,
[SPEAKER_03]: is terribly inconvenient, but it's not
really a resource-eliminating condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of my first questions would be,
have you tested these plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships under other growth
conditions such that you've verified,
[SPEAKER_03]: number one, that number two is,
have you grown these plants out for a
[SPEAKER_03]: longer period of time, where the root
systems will become more elaborate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you see if those relationships help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very valid concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we are most interested in
the signaling aspect in this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: decision-making aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think actually growing them very
early already tells us something about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we are thinking about everything
that relates to adaptation, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very important to consider soil and
later growth phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other projects that I didn't talk
about where we looked more at the angle at
[SPEAKER_00]: which roots grow, and we found a very
interesting gene, an exosys gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually affects how oxygen is
transported, we did the experiment that we
[SPEAKER_00]: basically cut the extreme accessions that
we knew were very different in their early
[SPEAKER_00]: growth behavior in very large soil pots,
and then we did excavation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, those accessions were very
different in terms of their rooting depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that question, it seems that there
was a very almost linear relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between those early growth rates that we
measured and the rooting depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is not necessarily true for
other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if we think about those
nutrient deficiencies, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point, plants will run out of the
nutrients, and then they don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be anyway the question of
nutrient efficiency and homeostasis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very different question from the one that
we're asking right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for questions that are related to
adaptation, we have to do those
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: In one of the slides, you showed that
along with the changes in root growth,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was also a change in the
hydrobotism.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So related to the previous question,
is there, in the plant's growth,
[SPEAKER_05]: do you think one strategy for
redevelopment is better or better over
[SPEAKER_05]: other, or it would depend on the
integrative aspects of plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the end, it's the integrated
aspect of plant physiology because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has to grow and produce enough seeds
to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the trade, I mean,
that will be selected on for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the environment, I mean, all these
accessions will have adapted to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way how you actually are more fit
in those different environments will be
[SPEAKER_00]: very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the question that I referred with the
root system architecture, where we then
[SPEAKER_00]: really looked at root system in the soil,
that really related to precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alleles that conferred either the
shallow or the deep one were basically
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated with the frequency of rainfall
in the areas where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good root system is only good for a
certain number of environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not for all environments, at least for
those wild species, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question was, you said that the
model was discovered to run it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how far back does the interaction go
between the non-alkylases?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far?
[SPEAKER_05]: In evolutionary time, when did this
interact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would need to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what they did for
generating the phylogenomic score,
[SPEAKER_00]: they looked at orthologs in many different
genomes and looked at either co-occurrence
[SPEAKER_00]: or co-absent, either one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would need to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but that also depends on the
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really haven't looked for this,
but we know it was very obvious in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants that in two of the mutants of the
receptor kinases, the root hairs were
[SPEAKER_00]: stunted, which is also associated with
iron deficiency responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't looked in a systematic
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on those plate assays that we do,
it's impossible to get the resolution for
[SPEAKER_00]: the root hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: In an anecdotal way, were the root hairs
and the roots themselves able to combine?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say so, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when there was bigger growth
inhibition observed in the mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the root hairs seemed to be more screwed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I would really need to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be very biased,
because the way how those things are
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed are very biased, typically.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think is the factor that
according to the different expression
[SPEAKER_01]: level of FAO, FRO2, messenger RNA among
the different sections?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hypothesis is we haven't tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it is there are a couple of
polymorphisms in the coding region that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't lead to changes in the minor acid
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually this will relate to RNA
stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also this study where they
overexpressed FRO2 with a 35S promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: under control in iron conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the 35S shouldn't be
affected by the iron deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression level of FRO2 was still
higher under iron deficiency, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest post-transcriptional regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be in line with the
polymorphisms that we observe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it will be an RNA turnover factor
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it's a great work,
as I'm sure you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have one technical question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life intensity in our redoxes,
as I know, if you grow it under less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 microns, then they're under deficient
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the life intensity you grow it on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second question is, in
agriculture, most crops will allocate
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon to the above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shorter roots would be a big advantage
for crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the function, like you showed us,
is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your main thing is the length,
because that's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the function of the roots would be
very short, but very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the root system architecture,
then, at a later stage, would tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about which soil layers can be
explored, how efficient they are for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we haven't really done this
systematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are ways to look at
later root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would love to think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do as far as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really haven't systematically
studied later root architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the light intensity, I would need
to look up how many microEinsteins are
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know is that we test described
mutants for iron, like the FRO2 mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: also the IRT1, that they basically,
whether we can reproduce the effects that
[SPEAKER_00]: were described for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under our light conditions,
we actually recapitulate the effects that
[SPEAKER_00]: were described.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
