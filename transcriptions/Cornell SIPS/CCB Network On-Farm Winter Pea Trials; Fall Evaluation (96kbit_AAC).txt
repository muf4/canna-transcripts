[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here at one of the Cornell Research
Farms with my winter pea plots that I
[SPEAKER_00]: planted about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to do my fall evaluations,
which we're asking that you do four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after planting and before snowfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a really mild winter here in
Ithaca that's just starting to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first light frost last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have vigorous plant growth and lots
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank those of you who have
shared photos of your plots and your
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with planting and your
questions on the Seedlink social feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really exciting to see things coming
up and it's cool to see you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with one another as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first trait we're evaluating is
emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the germination trait in
Seedlink, even though they're not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing, but close enough for our
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the evaluation rubric on page
seven of your protocol packet and using
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're asking what percentage of the
plot or what percentage of the planted
[SPEAKER_00]: rows are filled with plants as opposed to
having bare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will notice as we walked on our
plots we have some bare spots like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of the row on this right
hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had an issue with our planter where
that cone was not opening properly at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of our planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it gets better as we go down the
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had an issue like this,
whether it was a planter error or your dog
[SPEAKER_00]: dug a hole in the middle of the plot,
please just rate the part of the plot that
[SPEAKER_00]: was planted correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seed didn't get in the ground or
got dug up or something, you can ignore
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the rubric, emergence or germination
ratings range from one which is less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% emerged to five, which is all or
almost all plants emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plots look really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be choosing from the top
two ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four, which is more than 75% emerged or
five, which is all or almost all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this row, keep in mind we're just
rating the one row.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of bare spots,
including this space at the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say if I stacked all that
bare soil at one end and get maybe 15% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this is going to be a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: This double row in contrast is really nice
and full.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maybe one open spot there,
but I'm going to say that all or almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the seeds that we put in have
emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this is going to be a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: For vigor, we are asking how vigorous,
how robust, how fast growing, resilient to
[SPEAKER_00]: stress are the plants that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scale runs from one weak or slow
growing plants to five exceptional growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: robust appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remember that emergence and
vigor are different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plot with not very good
stand, but the plants that are there are
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and strong and big, that might
receive a good score for vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the score for emergence is
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I look across my plots, I see really
nice vigor across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be choosing from the top couple
of ratings, four, which is strong growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and five, which is really exceptional
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of my varieties had growth that was
pretty comparable to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really nice and strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tallest plants are about six inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very full, lush, looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then compared to this, which is my four,
I'm going to come over here to this plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is even a little more lush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are a little taller,
maybe seven or eight inches for the taller
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well filled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one really stood out in my plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give this one a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on which subset of varieties you
have, you may or may not see differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in emergence or fall vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they really do all look the same for
one of those traits, it's okay to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them the same rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will or we won't see differences later
in the season, but if they look the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's okay to score them the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been cutting some pea shoot
samples to take down to Jason and Andrew
[SPEAKER_00]: at Stone Barns and Blue Hill at Stone
Barns, so they can give us some tips on
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting pea shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been nibbling as I go along and
I'm finding some really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in sweetness and kind of that
rich, starchy pea flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder what else they will taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder what you will all taste when
you snack on your cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you decide to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Jason Grauer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the Senior Director of Farm and
Innovation at the Stone Barns Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm Andrew Lesmore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the Director of Special Projects at
Blue Hill at Stone Barns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited to dive into the
tasting component of this winter pea
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Hill and Stone Barns have been
engaging in cover crop trials both out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fields and in the kitchen for tastings
over many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited to be a part of
this project now with SeedLinked and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell and the expansive group of farmers
that are involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you are going out and using
SeedLinked to evaluate the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plots, we're going to be incorporating two
different flavor traits into this
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two different traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both are going to be rated on a scale
through one through five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell and SeedLinked have provided the
rubric for what each measurement looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like, one being unpleasant, five being
very, very delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to be inputting that into
the app as you're doing the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, feel free to
reach out to Jason or myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Thank you.
Thank you.
