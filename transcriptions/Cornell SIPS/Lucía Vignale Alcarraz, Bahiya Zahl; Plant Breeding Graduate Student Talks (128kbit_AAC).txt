[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of my talk is Introgressing
Resistance to Hempfather Mildew into
[SPEAKER_00]: Different Genetic Backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some of you work with father
mildews, and there are 10,000 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species that are host to 650 father
mildews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to introduce the one that we
are working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfather mildew is the most prevalent
disease in indoor hemp cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is caused by the biotrophic fungi,
colobinoidsis and brooche.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an isomysid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows on the leaves, but you can also
find it growing on stems and
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also don't have many fungicides
that we could use that are available to
[SPEAKER_00]: us, mainly because they are not on the
fungicide labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I want to tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want us to go back to 2018, 2019,
and at that point, farmers in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: started trying to grow hemp outside,
but there was not really like a history of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing hemp here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which were the cultivars that are
adopted to this climate, to the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the latitude?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Larry Slav did was get a lot of
cultivars, different genetic materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they planted them in New York,
in different sites, and they collected a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of data, growth rate, flowering
time, and one of those rates was disease
[SPEAKER_00]: severity to father mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want you to look at in this
graph is this cultivar over here that is
[SPEAKER_00]: FF58 that has a 0% disease rating both in
Geneva and in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to breed plants,
and we see a plant that doesn't get father
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, so is this a plant resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did is they grabbed FF58,
they crossed it, that is our resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, they crossed it with us,
a sub-tool parent, that is DJ's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did linkage mapping, and they ended
up finding out that there is a mutation in
[SPEAKER_00]: an MLO gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those people that have worked with
father mildews, MLOs are a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that haven't worked with MLOs,
they stand for mildew resistance locus O,
[SPEAKER_00]: a mutation or loss of function mutation,
and these genes confer durable,
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive, and broad spectrum resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Durable, we want it because pathogens are
mutating all the time, and we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to break resistant, so this is not
supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to happen with this type
of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then broad spectrum, because it's not
race specific, as it happens with other
[SPEAKER_00]: major R genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that it's not great,
because there are some pleotropic negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects in other plant species,
such as reduced yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a representation of what this
animal protein would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has seven transmembrane domains,
it has an N terminal, that if this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma membrane, it would be in the
extracellular part, and the C terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: would be towards the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that there are many MLO genes
in plants' genomes, and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in different plant processes,
such as reproduction, root figmotropism,
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic fungal colonization,
and why we're here today, powdery mild
[SPEAKER_00]: infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as there are so many of these genes in
plant genomes, they are divided in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clade five are the ones that are related
to powdery mild infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you usually need to mutate all of them
to have a resistant phenotype in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to be thinking now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know what MLOs are, and I said
before that the Alpha-58 had a mutation in
[SPEAKER_00]: the MLO, so it turns out that it has an
approximately 6.8 kV insertion between the
[SPEAKER_00]: exons 10 and 11, and that causes improper
mRNA splicing, and that results in a
[SPEAKER_00]: premature stop colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to say, I'm only talking
about one, and I just said that plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: have many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how many MLOs are in the cannabisativa
genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a study published in 2021,
and this is a long graph, but I only want
[SPEAKER_00]: you to look at the two clade five MLOs in
the cannabisativa genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSMLO1 is the one I was talking about,
that is in chromosome one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the mutation is,
insertion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CSMLO4, that we don't really know much
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with the information that I just gave
you, I propose four research questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, if you are homozygous
for the Alpha-58 version of the CSMLO1,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you always going to be susceptible?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in other backgrounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: My second question is, are there other
sources of resistance in other genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are, are they going to
interact with this gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Third question is, are we going to start
seeing negative pleiotropic effects in
[SPEAKER_00]: other genetic backgrounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing them in Alpha-58,
but it doesn't mean that we're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see them if we introgress this gene
into other backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question number four is,
are we going to see other alleles from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other clade five CSMLO gene that are going
to recover a susceptible phenotype in a
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous CSMLO Alpha-58?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of time, I'm not going to
talk about all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to focus on the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hypothesis is that if you're
homozygous for these alleles, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be resistant to powder L.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what am I doing to answer this
question or test this hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the first thing that I did was
generate a list with genotypes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: these alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the first one in this list is
Alpha-58.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's homozygous for that version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had two other genotypes,
1910-67 and white CVG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both females and high cannabinoid
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both heterozygous, and they are
susceptible to powder meldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: White CVG, I have to say, it's very
susceptible to hemp powder meldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so susceptible that that is the
genotype that we use to maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: single cranial isolate that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said that I wanted to
introgress it into different genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I made a list of cultivars or
genotypes that we had access to that
[SPEAKER_00]: capture genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are different types of materials
that belong to different market classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they have in common is that they are
all susceptible to galvanomyces and
[SPEAKER_00]: broscia, and that they are homozygous wild
type, or almost homozygous wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have my list one, my list two,
and what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cross them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I approaching this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the two plants that I want to cross
into one pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put a cage on top of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of the cage, I put a pollen
exclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take those plants into a room
that has the irrigation system installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that room is in flowering inductive
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's in short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let them cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, going back to the list that I just
showed you, I've done most of the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this winter, I had 52 crosses at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, the ones that are female by
female are a bit more tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm planning to do is I'm
planning to plant these seeds in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: this summer and evaluate their
susceptibility to hemp powder and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to choose plants to self or
to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to, with those seeds,
I'm going to plant them in the field next
[SPEAKER_00]: year, evaluate their susceptibility,
and then compare the phenotype and the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, base it just right now in the
CSML01 allele that we can add things
[SPEAKER_00]: later, as usually happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is my plan for the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this, I want to thank the Larry Smart
Lab, my committee members, and the funding
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for coming and listening to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't miss things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the female by female crosses
work or don't work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, how do the female by
female crosses work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, hemp is quite plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spray the female plant that you
want to start producing male flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: SES, silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a couple of applications,
it's going to start generating male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those male flowers produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with the high cannabinoid
plants is that they are highly inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are starting to show some
problems when it comes to generating
[SPEAKER_00]: viable pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can produce a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think you're going to have a lot
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't really have that many.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to make sure that I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the FL58, it has a loss of function
mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leads it to have resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the linkage mapping that was
George and Ali's paper, they identified a
[SPEAKER_00]: marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their most significant marker was close to
the CSMLO gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In chromosome one, around position 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a closest gene that explains
the phenotype that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mutated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also being expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is being transcribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I go back, it will cut the protein
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this part, the C terminal,
binds to calmodulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's supposed to be important for its
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it thus sends calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that, yes, it is a loss of
function mutation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're going to inoculate your field
trials, at what stage?
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you looking to score for adult
plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: In resistance or in seedlings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, in which stage do I
inoculate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that part?
[SPEAKER_04]: And at what stage are you going to screen
for the disease phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: And screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does depend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do it just in the field, I just
depend on when we can put the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would let them grow a bit and then
inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there is different
susceptibility in different developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stages in our plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know much about it in
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I want to consider.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did greenhouse inoculation last
month, I am just depending on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: space they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow so fast that when I
inoculate, I did them like three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: after I sowed the seeds were like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right now, they are taller than
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Bahia Zal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Lou said, I'm also a member of the
SMART Lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be talking today about fiber
hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So towards better fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to characterize hemp fiber
in diverse germplasm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing to know is what hemp fiber
even looks like if you haven't seen hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: plant after it's been redded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the process where you let the
natural microbes that exist in the field
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of break down all the pectins that
are holding everything together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it becomes very easy to separate
the fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll get these two types of fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get bast fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are these long fibers here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're high in cellulose.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're low in lignin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have a very high tensile
strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these vast fibers are the phloem
tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also have the inner woody core of
the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's called the herd.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is short fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are higher in lignin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have a lower tensile strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the xylem of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: These fibers have many different uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can be used as bedding for animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: The herd is very absorbent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make textiles out of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an example of something you
could go out and buy now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Patagonia's line of hemp clothing,
which is very durable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how it's marketed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also make paper out of it,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people have been using hemp for a very
long time for these sorts of applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the newer applications is in
composite materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an example of BMW who is
showing off their car door that they made
[SPEAKER_05]: out of natural fibers including hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fun fact, this is actually not a very
new thing because Henry Ford back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: early 1940s had a car that was nicknamed
the soybean car, where he used natural
[SPEAKER_05]: fibers that were rumored to be soy in a
resin to create these plastic panels on
[SPEAKER_05]: the outside of the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the goal was to make the car lighter
because back then they were using steel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an entirely new concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a renewed interest now in
sustainability and getting away from
[SPEAKER_05]: petroleum-based products and using more
renewable materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an interest in the automotive
and potentially aerospace industry to use
[SPEAKER_05]: composite materials using hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the objectives of this project
are guided by this concept that there are
[SPEAKER_05]: many uses for fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that we don't exactly know what
the variability that we have in hemp to
[SPEAKER_05]: work with to try to breed for better fiber
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to characterize a diverse set
of fiber varieties for fiber quality and
[SPEAKER_05]: also, of course, fiber yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yield is always very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And identify the variation in these traits
among the different varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you can see a list of 12 cultivars
that we identified as representing a broad
[SPEAKER_05]: range of the type of fiber hemp that is
currently being grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have Italian and French varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the European varieties that
have been bred for a very long time for
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a mix of Daishus and Manichus
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost all the French varieties are
Manichus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you also have these Asian-Chinese
background varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is an increasing interest in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: of growing these.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps they are better suited to
lower latitudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're including these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll notice also that we have this
here, Ursa Alta.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a new variety that is coming
out of the SMART program that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: releasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will be interesting to see how this
stacks up to other varieties or some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these Chinese varieties could be
considered more land races.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the approaches that we're
taking to characterizing the fiber in
[SPEAKER_05]: these plants is a histological approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: So taking very thin cross-sections using a
microtome and looking at the fiber bundles
[SPEAKER_05]: under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also doing cell wall component
analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at the different sugars that
are in the cell walls like cellulose or
[SPEAKER_05]: mannose or different components that could
be making up cellulose or hemicellulose or
[SPEAKER_05]: pectins.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also want to get a little bit more
quantitative detailed view that's a bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more high throughput than doing
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the thermogabermetric analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this can tell you the different
components that are in the whole milled
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can do whole stem or you could do
just fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That will give you the total amount of
cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin,
[SPEAKER_05]: ash content.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is important for knowing what your
cellulose yield is in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have fiber strength testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an important specification if
you're making composite materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know how strong it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp has been long time used as a very
high tensile strength material for ropes
[SPEAKER_05]: for ships and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there variation in this or is it
correlated to other traits that we can
[SPEAKER_05]: select on?
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, of course, want yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want high fiber yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to go through the process of
decortication.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's after I said you read the stems,
you allow the microbes to break down
[SPEAKER_05]: pectins, and then you can basically strip
off the fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a picture that I took.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the lights can dim a
little bit in here to see it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you can see this is the bass fiber
bundle.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's primary phloem there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hemp has a lot of phloem fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for this analysis, in 2022,
there were small plots were grown of these
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 cultivars by my lab mate, Luis
Fonserate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were four biological
replicates of each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we harvested a one meter square plot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those plants will be used for the
yield analysis and then also the
[SPEAKER_05]: thermogravimetric analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, we harvested four
individual plants and collected the middle
[SPEAKER_05]: internodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those middle internodes were used for
this histological analysis and also the
[SPEAKER_05]: cell wall component analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this cross section is 10 microns thick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used a cryomicrotome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these were embedded into a material
that if you freeze it very quickly,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't have to go through the process
of like paraffin embedding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I imaged three different fiber
bundles per replicate and then quantified
[SPEAKER_05]: some different fiber bundle and fiber cell
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did this measuring these dimensions
in Fiji.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can draw circles around things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It measures them when you give it a scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the results that I've gotten so
far is that there is differences in the
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber bundle areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an example, again, of a fiber
bundle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see significant differences within
the cultivars that we're testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: the highest being Fiber 79, which is Papua
is actually being a very good fiber
[SPEAKER_05]: variety that has very good fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this cultivar is a little bit
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Han cold, you might want to remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has very low fiber bundle area.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't see any significant
differences in the number of cells per
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber bundle area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there is a numerical difference
in a trend.
[SPEAKER_05]: So perhaps I just don't have enough power
to see that in this study.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also see differences in fiber cell
cross section area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, on cold came up small fiber
cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting that that trend holds
and Fiber 79 larger fiber cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had larger fiber bundles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing that is an important aspect
of natural fibers is the porosity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're using hemp for like
insulation or something, this can affect
[SPEAKER_05]: how well of an insulator it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also is indicative of how filled
the fiber cells are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these plants were all harvested at 50%
flowering, which is what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: use to harvest fiber as an indication of
when the plant is mature, but hasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: become too lignified yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the porosity is this ratio of the
lumens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the empty portion inside the
fiber cell to the total cell surface area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it basically tells you how open and
empty that cell is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, numerically, Han cold is
down lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting to see some of these
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are varieties that have certain
trends towards higher or lower values
[SPEAKER_05]: within the things that I'm measuring here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also saw some differences in cell wall
thickness, which is another important
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This may correlate with how strong the
fibers are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you a little bit more later
about how we're trying to test the fiber
[SPEAKER_05]: strength in these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to move on here and
talk a little bit about the cell wall
[SPEAKER_05]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was done by Eden Sorensen in the Rose
lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a diagram here showing you what
a cell wall looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's primary cell walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's secondary cell walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: One differentiating thing between them is
that primary cells, you can see here,
[SPEAKER_05]: have these pectins that are gluing
everything together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have lignin in the secondary
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said earlier that the bass fiber is
low in lignin because the main component
[SPEAKER_05]: of the bass fiber that we're harvesting is
the primary phloem, not the secondary
[SPEAKER_05]: phloem, although it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're hopefully decreasing lignin
because for many applications,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't want a lignified fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this analysis, we're using this
instrument.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a high performance anion exchange
chromatography with pulse amperometric
[SPEAKER_05]: detection.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very long name.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this can measure a number of different
sugars that are components of the cell
[SPEAKER_05]: wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are very cut and clear what
they are, so like cellulose.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then all these other sugars can be
components of multiple things,
[SPEAKER_05]: or at least some of them can be components
of multiple things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think you can see here that xylose
can be a component of hemicellulose or of
[SPEAKER_05]: pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't always quite tell that if
it's high in one sugar, then it's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely, oh, it has more pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did see differences in fiber
cellulose, which is an important thing
[SPEAKER_05]: because cellulose is one of the more
important things in fiber yield and hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also saw differences in
galactaronic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So galactaronic acid is only in pectin in
the diagram that I showed you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not one of those that's like,
oh, it could be hemicellulose,
[SPEAKER_05]: it could be pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more indicative that if it's high
in galactaronic acid, then it's high in
[SPEAKER_05]: pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might have implications for how
easy it is to break up those tissues and
[SPEAKER_05]: how easy it is to decorticate after
redding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might want to select for a lower
pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done the, I haven't evaluated
the decorticability yet, so we'll see if
[SPEAKER_05]: those correlate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also saw differences in fiber
galactose, but galactose can be found in
[SPEAKER_05]: hemicellulose or pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one is a little bit more
ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also arabinose, which again can be
found in hemicellulose and pectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: But interesting, again, on cold pops up,
very low in arabinose, so interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a correlation of all of these
things that I measured just to see if they
[SPEAKER_05]: are, correlate with each other,
and I'm only showing here ones that were
[SPEAKER_05]: significantly correlated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, all of the correlations
with cellulose were not significant,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is something I'd be interested in,
although it did have a positive
[SPEAKER_05]: correlation with the fiber bundle area of
.5, but I don't think we had enough power
[SPEAKER_05]: here to maybe see if that was significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also will want to look at, the strength
and see if that's correlated with like the
[SPEAKER_05]: cell wall thickness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have this instrument called an
instron.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically you can like clip a fiber to
either one of these little clamps,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it pulls on it until the fiber
breaks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see a graph that looks like
this, and where each one of those little
[SPEAKER_05]: triangles are, that's where when the fiber
broke, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the trouble is though that it's hard to
get a single fiber with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just keep pulling on the fibers,
you keep splitting them, and to use a
[SPEAKER_05]: machine like this, you want to kind of use
a single fiber, and also you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: standardize by the fiber's diameter,
and measuring a fiber's diameter is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually not that easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the takeaways that I found with
the work that I've done so far in this
[SPEAKER_05]: project is that we did see some
differences in some of the fiber bundle
[SPEAKER_05]: and fiber cell dimensions.
[SPEAKER_05]: By cultivar, we didn't see a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually forgot to say that the
results that I was showing with the cell
[SPEAKER_05]: wall composition, those were for just the
fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we looked at the whole stem level,
there were no significant differences,
[SPEAKER_05]: but when you peeled off just the fiber and
ran that analysis, then we saw
[SPEAKER_05]: differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the isolated fibers did have
compositional differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the next steps, I want to do
the third one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thermogravimetric analysis to evaluate the
lignocellulosic composition.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also need to decorticate these rided
stems to evaluate the fiber yield,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we want to identify more
instrumentation that could be used for
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is the Instron the best instrument to
do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some other, down in North
Carolina State, I think they have a very
[SPEAKER_05]: big fiber and textile college,
and they have some like scanners that you
[SPEAKER_05]: can use to get the diameter of fibers and
some other instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also developed some more high throughput
methods for characterizing this,
[SPEAKER_05]: because actually doing histological work
takes a very long time, and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of materials and there's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it possible that we could,
in the field, just use like a 3D printed
[SPEAKER_05]: microtome to take thicker sections and
then stain them with like a
[SPEAKER_05]: non-fluorescent stain that stains lignin
and cellulose, and just take a picture
[SPEAKER_05]: with a camera to get a rough idea of the
area of the fiber that has been done in
[SPEAKER_05]: some other crops, like switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that something we can try and hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp is actually very hard to cut into the
stems, so I don't know how that would
[SPEAKER_05]: work, even using a razor blade when I was
preparing my samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully that could work in hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say thank you to everyone in my
lab, the SMART Lab and the ROSE Lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to my special committee,
Jason Londo, Moira Sheehan, Jocelyn Rose,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then also our funding sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're funded by New York State Ag and
Market, the New York State Office of
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Management, and then also I was
funded this last year on an EOA ship,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's extension and outreach through
the Cornell Agrotech Program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you want to learn more about the
work that Cornell is doing in hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can go to this link here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting, your first slide
around uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you work with industry partners or
material scientists in ecology,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to kind of define what the quality
fiber is, the specific uses, just how you
[SPEAKER_03]: interact?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have industry partners, and one of
the things I've learned is that some uses,
[SPEAKER_05]: the specifications for the fibers is
highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like in the automobile and aerospace
industry, the fibers that they can use
[SPEAKER_05]: have to meet certain specifications,
and it can be hard to switch to new
[SPEAKER_05]: materials because they have very strict
specifications, and they also really need
[SPEAKER_05]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not just high quality, but they can't
have variation in the materials that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're using to create their composites.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even heard from one industry member that
they would rather have a lower fiber
[SPEAKER_05]: quality, but consistent and uniform than a
high fiber quality, but if it wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, with fibers, does tensile
strength, is it proportional to the cross
[SPEAKER_02]: section?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, could you use that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of measuring the cross section,
could you use to just weigh the fibers and
[SPEAKER_02]: get tensile strength by weight?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, is the weight of the
fibers correlated with the tensile
[SPEAKER_05]: strength?
[SPEAKER_05]: The weight, I think that the cross section
could be, but it also depends on the lumen
[SPEAKER_05]: area, and the weight, I think that would
maybe not work because again, as I was
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, it's hard to get individual fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have a picture here of what it
looks like when you decorticate,
[SPEAKER_05]: although it kind of, let's go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the fiber, those long fibers that
come off the stem, it kind of basically
[SPEAKER_05]: looks like that when it's coming out of
the decorticator without the herd on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to get an individual fiber and weigh it
and then compare that to another
[SPEAKER_05]: individual fiber, I don't know if you
could really do that, although it might be
[SPEAKER_05]: correlated with strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the, you had chicken
bedding down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that likely to be a big market for
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because actually, I know that trying to go
with corn stover and miscanthus are also
[SPEAKER_01]: going for those, that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there seems like there'd be a lot more
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is more of like using a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't, for a lot of applications,
you don't use the herd, or even if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: growing high cannabinoids, hemp,
like you don't harvest the stalk for
[SPEAKER_05]: anything usable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there something else you can use it
for?
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem with using something like
high cannabinoid hemp for application like
[SPEAKER_05]: that is that it can smell like hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if for a farmer, maybe they don't care
as much, but for, if you're just a
[SPEAKER_05]: backyard chicken keeper, maybe you don't
want your whole coop to smell like hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, in my personal experience, the fiber
varieties and grain varieties don't smell
[SPEAKER_05]: as strongly of that kind of hempy
terpenoid smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they still have a hemp smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, question on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see in the chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you familiar with the papers of Kay
Asua measuring fiber strength in linum?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I am not.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, linum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that flax?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not familiar with that exact
paper, but I will look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can imagine a complex in order to
measure fiber strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if for some collaboration
of material science, do you need your
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues to see how they measure
construction material strength,
[SPEAKER_03]: or even the car material strength?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so here, so Star was asking about
the different collaborations we can have
[SPEAKER_05]: with material scientists.
[SPEAKER_05]: About the material strengths and how to
measure it and specifications that are
[SPEAKER_05]: needed for the different applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we definitely are looking at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually the Cornell has the College of
Human Ecology here, and they do a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: work with textile fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have been in contact with them
about the, some of the methods they're
[SPEAKER_05]: using.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also with NC State, as I said,
they have a very large fiber program and
[SPEAKER_05]: then also the USDA, ARS, they are working
on, they just started working on fiber
[SPEAKER_05]: quality standards for hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have, you know, very robust
standards for cotton, but no such thing
[SPEAKER_05]: exists for hemp of standardizing what are
the things we measure and how we measure
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is currently being worked on at
the USDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are no more questions,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
