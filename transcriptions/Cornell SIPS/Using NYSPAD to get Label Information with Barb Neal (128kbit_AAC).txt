[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a short PowerPoint presentation on
getting used to using the NISEPAD website
[SPEAKER_00]: to get label information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you find it helpful so that
you can fill out your Master Gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets in order to complete the training
in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to do is to go to the
NISEPAD website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website address is listed up here and
in your handout, but you can also just
[SPEAKER_00]: Google NISEPAD and you will come right to
this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do in order to get a
label is to look to where I've circled it
[SPEAKER_00]: in yellow under pesticides information and
press products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will bring you to the search engine
part of the NISEPAD website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The search engine is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search by different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look for insecticides with a
specific lower toxicity level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out if a product is
restricted or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, what we're just going to do,
we're trying to find a particular label.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to enter the label number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to enter the product EPA
registration number and to try to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is where I've circled in
red, product EPA registration number,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to use that pull down menu to
choose New York product number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pull down New York product number
and leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then enter your EPA registration
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have the dash number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where it says 42697-60, put the dashes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then slide your mouse down to the bottom
of the search page and to find that search
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to see it when you're
putting in the EPA number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of off screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to slide the website screen down
so you can find that search button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then press that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works, you'll see this card,
so to speak, that shows the information of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product that you have put the EPA
number in for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, I put in the number for
Safer Soap, very common insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the card shows you a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that has, of course, the name of the
product, the New York product number or
[SPEAKER_00]: the EPA number, the company, and whether
it's restricted use or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's no restrictions,
which means that homeowners can buy this
[SPEAKER_00]: product and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was restricted in New York,
that means only certified pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applicators could use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second circle, it says LI use yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means the product can be used in
Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some products leach too quickly
through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sandy soils of Long Island,
you could have a potential for groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some chemicals that you
cannot use in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them here in upstate New York,
but not in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the square, there's a button called
More, and you press that to get the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you press that, another more detailed
card will come up with more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has information about what type of
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in home gardens and ornamental
plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out that it also will
have the signal warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be caution warning or danger or,
I guess, poison and the most toxic of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing to be able to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get the label, you press
the most recent label date.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's for 3-9-2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So press the blue highlighted numbers for
the most recent label for this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will come up is a picture of the
label for Safer Soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had chosen this product to look at,
you would be seeing what's on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the upper right is the back side of
the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But inside, once you purchase a product,
you kind of peel away this part,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see the actual fine print,
so to speak, of the label, how it's used
[SPEAKER_00]: on one inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, your eyes would be better
than mine if you could read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little tip in order to read
the fine print of a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to swipe your mouse to the right,
and sort of magically these three buttons
[SPEAKER_00]: will appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you press the plus button, it increases
the font size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to read this fine print.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually like to use this because,
quite frankly, a lot of labels,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to squeeze so much information
into them that the actual physical label,
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper label that's part of the
product, the type's really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is really nice to be able to have
this larger, be able to really read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can print it out and be able to study
the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, the label is the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to apply a chemical according to
the label, whether it's organic or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that part of what we want you to
learn is how to quickly access the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important parts of information for the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the first aid?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the environmental hazards?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the product?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of PPE, protective equipment
that you need to wear in order to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself when using the chemical,
those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just want you to be familiar with
the aspects of a label, specifically with
[SPEAKER_00]: safety in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have enjoyed this PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good luck searching NicePad.
