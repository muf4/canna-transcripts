[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell University
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, so I'm really happy to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see all as Carlin mentioned I
retired at the end of January I've sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: been rooting around my house for the month
of February and trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do next and That's still a work in
progress But I wanted to talk in I also
[SPEAKER_01]: note that I'm the third retiree or
soon-to-be retired To give us talk this
[SPEAKER_01]: semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like it's a trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have what five or six or Anyhow,
it just does underline to me that we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: this time of transition so so I wanted to
talk about You know my view of extension
[SPEAKER_01]: and Instead of going through a
blow-by-blow of my retrospective of my
[SPEAKER_01]: career just talk about different models
that people use for extension And how is
[SPEAKER_01]: it that growers adopt practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: What what what are the impacts that we we
make?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the interest of full disclosure,
I want to say that this is a rerun and I
[SPEAKER_01]: gave this almost this exact talk about
five years ago up at Agritech and So it
[SPEAKER_01]: was great to have that skeleton here for
my for my talk today So I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: start out a little bit with my my history
And I came to Cornell in 1985 to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: entomology Graduate student.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just come off the Peace Corps in
Honduras and Was eager to continue my
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with Jan and Irup as my advisor
and then Finally, they let me have a PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got to shake hands with Frank Rhodes
the president of Cornell at that time
[SPEAKER_01]: Following that I spent five years working
in grape entomology a lot of that time I
[SPEAKER_01]: was with Working on this one insect the
Eastern grape leaf hopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to know that sucker well in five
years But by the end of that it sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: felt kind of narrow So it was a
disciplinary focus and it was just on
[SPEAKER_01]: grape grape insects so when the
opportunity came to apply for the Finger
[SPEAKER_01]: Lakes grape program area education
extension educator job, I Jumped in and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got that job And I have to say that
initially I thought I'm an entomologist I
[SPEAKER_01]: know about bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown a grapevine in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly that I have to offer these people
because they've been growing grapes for
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five generations in certain cases
but I soon found out that they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting me to be the guy that knows how
to fill up a sprayer or Exactly prune
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes like like they could And that was a
that might be the most wonderful extension
[SPEAKER_01]: job in New York actually So I did that for
nine years It was based in Penyan and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved back to the station or Cornell
agritech as we call it now as senior
[SPEAKER_01]: extension associate to start this
statewide viticulture extension program
[SPEAKER_01]: and Carlin's already mentioned some of the
things I did and I'll highlight a few more
[SPEAKER_01]: things as I go along So this has been a
great run for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so much fun Being in the
position I'm I'm in So what I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: address Today is well, what is it that
growers do with our research?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know What changes do they make?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we know that they're making change?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how the funding agencies know what
changes are making and this is important
[SPEAKER_01]: because Funding funders are increasingly
interested in metrics, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll go through a couple funding
models in in a minute So here's my Five
[SPEAKER_01]: key takeaways from extension and the way I
ran my extension program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all My feeling is that the
on-farm research and demonstration
[SPEAKER_01]: projects are kind of the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always view that as My first job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there to solve problems for
people necessarily to take calls To tell
[SPEAKER_01]: people what to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the second point is that
extension Some people think it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: being a consultant But it's not about
telling growers what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's about learning Now get to that
in a moment again, so generating
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining data is the thing That sets us
aside from consultants and people who tell
[SPEAKER_01]: growers what to do so that's kind of our
superpower is that we have access to data
[SPEAKER_01]: we we generate it and This is news to
funders but change doesn't Generally
[SPEAKER_01]: happen within the life of a single
project, you know, it's more gradual than
[SPEAKER_01]: that And finally there was So I want to go
through a couple of Models so I think our
[SPEAKER_01]: standard thing that we you know,
I grew up with is that you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers They're the ones that generate
the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pass it on to extension to
disseminate the knowledge the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: adopt the practices and then it's kind of
like a little package that you deliver to
[SPEAKER_01]: them and So this approach Really
emphasizes, you know define the project
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem test hypothesis do an
experimental design get the results and
[SPEAKER_01]: then at the end you get this statement
which I've seen in so many grant proposals
[SPEAKER_01]: that Results will be disseminated through
winter conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many of you PIs have written that
in grant proposals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah me too and then I've been listed on
Many many more grant proposals that say
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly that So that's kind of the
standard model And a while back we came
[SPEAKER_01]: along probably about 20 years of it came
along this this outcome driven project
[SPEAKER_01]: model and that was championed with a New
York Farm Viability Institute the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast Sarah program and this guy are
David Smith who was the associate director
[SPEAKER_01]: of Cornell Cooperative Extension is the
guy behind Disseminating this model and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting these organizations to adopt it So
here's how that goes first you start out
[SPEAKER_01]: with grower to find barriers and
opportunities You get growers together
[SPEAKER_01]: saying yeah, what are your problems the
second goals you have performance targets
[SPEAKER_01]: and then milestones And activities and
this is all pointed out to the outcomes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So X number growers adopt practices Say Y
amount of money or generate Z economic
[SPEAKER_01]: impact so this is a fine model,
but When I wrote these proposals and I did
[SPEAKER_01]: several of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found myself in the middle of it saying
Damnit, you know, I just want to test
[SPEAKER_01]: these three treatments and see what
happens and This model doesn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: anything necessarily about the knowledge
itself or the things that you learn It's
[SPEAKER_01]: more about how people react to it so
where's the science and So that model sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of goes like this you expose 500 growers
to practice you receive training and then
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 rows adopt it and And then these are
the things that come out of it metrics
[SPEAKER_01]: success stories outcomes Interesting they
never asked for failure stories Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried something it didn't it didn't work
So it's still the packet at the end And
[SPEAKER_01]: here's an example this is from a few years
ago the farm viabilities website and they
[SPEAKER_01]: say well You know, it's not about the
hours a clock and research fact sheets,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about what people do To this so
you're supposed to Again measure these
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics have the success stories and then
the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay And I have an example of that this is
a project we did 2006 to 2008 we put
[SPEAKER_01]: together this comprehensive sustainable
practices workbook called vine balance Did
[SPEAKER_01]: this with members of the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It covers pest management bit of culture
spray technology, etc, etc So it it covers
[SPEAKER_01]: a wide range of things But here's sort of
the bottom line and this again is off the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm viability website is that What it
came down to is the only metrics we could
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with was nitrogen use so So they
invested a hundred forty eight thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in the in the project We reported
that growers reduced nitrogen application
[SPEAKER_01]: by forty percent and here's the return on
investment Well, that's just one aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: something where everything else if it's
about sustainability It's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to measure because it's about rural
relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about Community it's about
environmental quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you put a dollar figure on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder than Something I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's how I think it actually works or
should work You have growers researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: extension all kind of communicating with
each other the researchers bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: disciplinary focus extension brings a
generalist focus And then come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas and questions trials, you know That
can be laboratory and field trials
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborative on-farm demos and then you
have the results But you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: communicating during the project and then
growers try something and then they adapt
[SPEAKER_01]: it right and then it goes back so so
really It's definitely not a package it's
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a part more of a process basically
So I want to offer several Examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: things where we know that growers have
really changed their practices And then
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go on and talk about some field
trials and sort of the impacts So here's
[SPEAKER_01]: one that Dave Godori did in the early
2000s He took some Powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculated clusters at various times and
kind of overturned the prevailing thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about How to keep your clusters clean from
powdery mildew and later on downy mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: So before he did this people thought well
They're susceptible that the entire summer
[SPEAKER_01]: and until there until you get reach eight
eight degrees bricks When they start
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening, so you got to keep it Things on
well, he found that they actually became
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant much earlier So, you know four
to six weeks after bloom Then you could be
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that if your clusters were clean,
they they're gonna stay clean and So this
[SPEAKER_01]: has been a cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is stuff that Wayne Wilcox wrote and
so We really emphasize a pre bloom to
[SPEAKER_01]: early post bloom Sprays, you know for the
times when the grapes are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible and so forth And then after
that you can sort of ease off on the on
[SPEAKER_01]: the things Directed at the clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a cornerstone one of our
IPM program is this Another one is
[SPEAKER_01]: involved Justine Vanden Heuvel and Gavin
Sachs and it was all about leaf removal
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you should do it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: and Before they did this study People knew
that leaf removal was important that
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster exposure was important,
but they just sort of say well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm gonna do it when I get get
around to it and you know, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime, you know midsummer or something
well Gavin a wine chemist Went out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard every week collected samples
measured methoxy pyrazines and found out
[SPEAKER_01]: that the cluster exposure Very early in
the season really had a big impact on how
[SPEAKER_01]: many of these methoxy pyrazines were
produced and therefore how many of them
[SPEAKER_01]: that you ended up with at the end of the
season so So that Alerted people to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that the early leaf removal is
important and And it really changed
[SPEAKER_01]: practices it went from I'll do it when I
get around to it to god I better get out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and do that because It's so
important So we wrote this up in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: issue of Appalachian Cornell this article
called Cornell researchers track tackled
[SPEAKER_01]: green flavors and red wines Andrew Landers
was here for about 15 years or so before
[SPEAKER_01]: he left and he's back in England,
but his spray trials Sprayer set up using
[SPEAKER_01]: deflectors, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use The joke with him that every
talk could be about improving deposition
[SPEAKER_01]: and reducing drift Because that's what he
contemplated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had set up this pattern ater Yeah,
one of his many demonstrations at field
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings and then he did collaborate with
Jim Myers and then Justine Vanden Heuvel
[SPEAKER_01]: Were able to quantify through this thing
called a EP QA Enhanced point quadrate
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis that the spray coverage,
you know really was Highly dependent on
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit exposure And so this grower bill
dollar pool took took it upon himself to
[SPEAKER_01]: build one of these pattern aters window
screens and So here's an example of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grower Taking something that was designed
for research and applying it to their own
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard so he built it for what 50 50
bucks and he says in 15 minutes I can run
[SPEAKER_01]: my sprayer and Find out, you know how how
the spray is being distributed and make
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments their life Okay This is a
little bit more long-term and this is our
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen use guidelines when I started I
talked to growers In 97 and they say oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah 300 pounds ammonium nitrate 100
pounds actually Nitrogen per acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I can't afford to skimp on
this It's cheap insurance You hear that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot But Nelson Shawless In 1960s
established this experiment called the
[SPEAKER_01]: West Tier factorial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get into details about it But
found out that you know, no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: much nitrogen they applied, you know,
if it was above 50 pounds They only got a
[SPEAKER_01]: little extra vine growth and no extra
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So So he was able to say, you know 50
pounds that's that's it so You know that
[SPEAKER_01]: went through Bob pool Terry Bates and my
predecessor Dave Peterson started talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about this and maybe the 1980s early 80s
and then I carried on and pretty soon I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to growers at Coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said well, how much are you putting on
this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, oh I backed it off to 70 pounds In
the next year 50 pounds and of course many
[SPEAKER_01]: of our vinifera growers don't apply any
additional nitrogen at all, so so this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a big big success and This is what we
cited in our farm viability grant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know 30 to 50 percent reduction in
Nitrogen application or excess nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: application Okay, so I want to move on now
to some examples of on-farm Trials and the
[SPEAKER_01]: first one is field trials that educate me,
you know being an entomologist not having
[SPEAKER_01]: any background in nutrition or not that
much in horticulture And then surveys to
[SPEAKER_01]: gauge how important an issue was
demonstrations that happened alongside
[SPEAKER_01]: research trials and then sort of
serendipity how one thing turned into
[SPEAKER_01]: something else and then and then I want to
finish it off with a Project that's had an
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous economic impact But it's based on
stuff that was started in the 60s and and
[SPEAKER_01]: moved on with our concord worse so My
first example is effective foliar and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron applications and You know,
I mean I was an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was early on in my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anything about boron So I
decided to do this trial with kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy who's kind of a backbencher You know,
he doesn't really go to meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't so but He had a low boron
vineyard and so we set up a trial there
[SPEAKER_01]: and compared, you know soil and no soil
and different rates of foliar sprays so
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the results and this is you know,
like the second year or the first year of
[SPEAKER_01]: my extension Found out that the soil and
foliar application increased the yield
[SPEAKER_01]: pursuit in his vineyard increased fruit
set but One pound of foliar was as good as
[SPEAKER_01]: you know two and a half pounds and two and
a half pounds often resulted in foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: injury So this is the patio results and
the foliar increased patio more on more
[SPEAKER_01]: than the soil but two and a half pounds
again was too much and one was enough and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the boron levels dropped in August
when we sampled again, but But not as much
[SPEAKER_01]: with the soil application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gave more sustained release of
boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was important so I put that in my
newsletter and and that gave me the
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence to be able to make
Recommendations to growers about boron and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think had an impact again, how do we
measure it?
[SPEAKER_01]: next example, I want to Relate has to do
with wine balance our important thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: and So this is an opportunistic thing that
was made possible because Alan lacks so
[SPEAKER_01]: retired he had a vineyard up at the
station and Nobody was going to take it
[SPEAKER_01]: over so I did and that gave me an
opportunity to do some really radical
[SPEAKER_01]: things and Run that vineyard into the
ground which I did over the next several
[SPEAKER_01]: years Okay, and and this is something
where you know I had done all the reading
[SPEAKER_01]: and but I really wanted to experience what
happens when you manipulate carbon source
[SPEAKER_01]: and sink things so Again, you know the
source being the leaf area the sinks for
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbohydrates that are produced You
know going to different places shoot tips
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit roots storages and so forth So I
decided to do this experiment to radically
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate these things in in that
vineyard And I wanted to measure how
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly how defolating vines affected
the buttocks Because that's a sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is that You want to maximize the bud
hardiness, but what happens when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: downing mildew later in the season you
lose all your foliage etc Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm not going to tell you everything
about this, but we established five
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a standard one with 24 shoots we
had one where we Limited to eight shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: we defuse some lines and then we
defoliated you know one time and two times
[SPEAKER_01]: Vines Not exactly what I'd planned,
but you know here we go the standard was
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be balanced cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know eight shoots under cropped
De-fruited no crop Sink limited and then
[SPEAKER_01]: over cropped and source limited with a
high root for or really Infinite fruit to
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage Ratio So this is what we did we
defoliated vines early in July by August
[SPEAKER_01]: they regrown grown complete other canopy
and so we then sort of cut them off at the
[SPEAKER_01]: tenth node and And let those vines
continue to ripen the fruit continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: ripen without any leaves whatsoever So
here's the results in a nutshell So the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard is on the left If we look at the
eight shoot we reduce the yield by sixty
[SPEAKER_01]: percent But increase the cluster weight by
forty percent, so you know the clusters
[SPEAKER_01]: were forty percent bigger Of course there
were far fewer of them, which is counts
[SPEAKER_01]: for all the yield loss Defoliated them
once that fruit set we got really tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: berries At the same number of clusters,
but our yield went down by sixty percent
[SPEAKER_01]: by cluster weight by by forty percent And
then but the fruit ripened because we had
[SPEAKER_01]: another canopy there And then when we
defoliated again, you know we lost the
[SPEAKER_01]: yield minus sixty percent cluster weight
down by fifty percent and of course that
[SPEAKER_01]: these grapes didn't ripen at all and And
then the buds were not as hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only treatment We had that
affected the bud hardiness negatively and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of those vines died So I ran them
into the ground Okay, so so So that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things that those are the two
things I did to find out well How far can
[SPEAKER_01]: I push things one one way or another you
know what impact do our practices have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could do that out of the experiment
station because I didn't have to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about the crop The third example I have is
a survey that we did about grapevine leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: roll so we wanted to survey the vineyards
to measure the extent and Impact and this
[SPEAKER_01]: all started out with Mark Fuchs Hi Bruce
who came and Shortly after he came to
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell started looking at vineyards,
and we found a lot of leaf roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Lemberger four rows of Lemberger
with the leaf roll symptoms and Very
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent and I was later to find out that
all the Lemberger wood came from one
[SPEAKER_01]: source And it was all infected with leaf
roll in about ten days So we did this
[SPEAKER_01]: survey and Mark did this several
locations, I think about 70 vineyards that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did and We found out that it was indeed
very common 70% of our vineyards our
[SPEAKER_01]: vinifera vineyards had At least some leaf
roll some a lot some not so much in our
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid varieties about 57% of them I had
had a different leaf roll So my part okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me and then mark measured the
spread and found out that year-over-year
[SPEAKER_01]: This these mealybugs at the top of the
screen that you can see really would
[SPEAKER_01]: transmit it from vine to vine within the
Vineyard So my part was to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: Vineyard where I knew there was some
infected and some non infected or non
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomatic vines and Do periodic fruit
sampling so I did this and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically the upshot was we found out that
At least in terms of bricks It delayed
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening by about two weeks, which is a
problem with Cabernet Franc when you
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest it in the middle of October anyhow
So essentially the infected vines were
[SPEAKER_01]: never getting the fruit was never getting
ripe on them So that's in the single
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then you know follow that up with
looking at paired vines in different
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyards, you know 11 different vineyards
and found out, you know at a given time up
[SPEAKER_01]: to three and a half degrees bricks
difference between the infected and non
[SPEAKER_01]: infected vine and this was after 2004 when
we lost a lot of vines due to winter
[SPEAKER_01]: injury and Here's a you know, and they'd
plant new vines and they'd be infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here they lost the vine and then a
couple years later they find out that
[SPEAKER_01]: their replants are infected with virus and
They have to go and replace them again so
[SPEAKER_01]: so this really convinced a lot of growers
to pay attention to leaf roll and We put
[SPEAKER_01]: this all in this article about grapevine
leaf roll and then that was followed up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a mark Enlisted Miguel Gomez and the
cooperators to do an economic analysis of
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf roll And he went beyond what
economists usually do You know what
[SPEAKER_01]: economists usually do is say well this
cost the industry X millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: But they went through and they did
different management scenarios and a net
[SPEAKER_01]: present value analysis to show if you
actually Did different management where
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd end up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came up with a figure that of you
know, probably ten thousand dollars an
[SPEAKER_01]: acre over 25 year life of the vineyard
Okay, here's one with a another one with
[SPEAKER_01]: Justine who again just after she or I
started some different trials with canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: management and this one is about shoot
thinning with Marshall Foch and so she did
[SPEAKER_01]: a study where she did control versus
unshoot then versus shoot then early
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest and late harvest and then Did some
wine sensory analysis on that And this
[SPEAKER_01]: gets to the point that well how much does
it cost and how much is the benefit So I
[SPEAKER_01]: went out with these guys one day and timed
them as they were kind of going at slow
[SPEAKER_01]: walking speeds doing the shoot thing and
you know about 15 seconds per vine that
[SPEAKER_01]: Translates to three hours an acre 50 50
bucks, but then they lose crop too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're reducing the crop Whilst
thinning the shoots so that's seven or
[SPEAKER_01]: fifty dollars in lower seats So to make
this pay essentially you have to you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to get an extra eight hundred dollars an
acre in quality Whether that's being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell your grapes or have higher priced
wine as opposed to flank right And then
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a timing issue if you wait until
the shoots are that long it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take you five times as long to do so this
is Steve Lurch Justine's Technician that
[SPEAKER_01]: Was a little late on a study that Justine
was doing that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what did Justine find?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she found that and this is compared
to the control, you know where they
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested early they didn't shoot then
Just doing the shoot thinning increased
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the good stuff fruit banana apple
rose decreased some of the bad stuff So
[SPEAKER_01]: that had an effect just the shoot thinning
Just harvesting them a week later had a
[SPEAKER_01]: big effect Kind of comparable and if you
did them both together, it was kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: added additive effect So these are
interesting results And then she measured,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know revenue and costs and Figured out
that the grower would have to receive you
[SPEAKER_01]: know $161 more a ton to actually pay for
you know pay for that thinning in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the last yield Or 22 cents a bottle or 31
cents a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fine so About a year after she
did that I decided to go out and do demo
[SPEAKER_01]: trials in eight different vineyards mostly
hires and I'm not going to go through this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole table, but you know 18 to 42 seconds
per vine half a ton to 3.3 tons per acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know differences in lost yield and
quality and then We did see a very
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent bricks effect So this is a one
notable thing where we actually made wines
[SPEAKER_01]: out of these So this is a block called the
liamio Down on Cuca Lake and you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between the clusters there
Unthinned on the left thinned on the right
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different cluster shape And in set
so what happened in this well We reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: the shoots providing clusters providing
crop weight tons per acre by about 30 to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, almost 50% But increased the
cluster weight the berry weight and the
[SPEAKER_01]: berries per cluster also increased the
bricks So came up with higher quality
[SPEAKER_01]: food, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so if we look at you know,
he was getting $800 per ton So we figured
[SPEAKER_01]: that with the amount we've thinned off in
this low yielding vineyard He'd need an
[SPEAKER_01]: extra $300 per ton or $50 50 cents a
bottle for the price so that goes a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way, but The problem was is that
this is a highly prized wine without shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: thinning I went for 22 bucks a bottle and
if he had one in you know a ton less fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: per acre that translates to 831 fewer
bottles of wine to sell and $16,000 lower
[SPEAKER_01]: gross receipts, so So in this case,
you know, you can sell all he wants and
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality the extra quality gets
probably doesn't matter And I'm gonna skip
[SPEAKER_01]: over this this just shows so we did the
same thing on Traminette But it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower proportion of the yield and really
it only made a $90 difference per ton for
[SPEAKER_01]: Equal returns or 13 cents So highly
cultivar dependent and yield dependent So
[SPEAKER_01]: here's what you know, the wine evaluation
said for Justine's project.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the shoot thin wine You know,
they found it was different than the
[SPEAKER_01]: control and they preferred it over the
control, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one result And I did with the
liamio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the grape growers convention
and did side by side of the thinned and
[SPEAKER_01]: unthinned vines and All the growers pretty
much thought they were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tasted differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which one do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% said I like the shoot thin 40% said I
like the note shoot then so that's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: even thing so I just underlines the point
that it's really hard to relate this to
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars or willingness to pay for the wine
so Okay Fifth example of shoot thinning
[SPEAKER_01]: trial turned into a fruit rot trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one where I was looking at the
impact of shoot thinning on yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of Vignole, but it turned out,
you know, we we turned this into a rot
[SPEAKER_01]: trial so Here's the VSP with shoot
thinning no shoot thinning high cordon
[SPEAKER_01]: with shoot thinning or no shoot thinning
and then Since this was machine harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: with longspurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of these persistent
rachises from last year a lot of betrayed
[SPEAKER_01]: us an oculum on those So we did a trial
where we so So here's the here's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: what the wines we made out of them looked
like Anyhow, so Wayne went out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: did the betrayed us ratings and and we
looked at all three scenarios on the two
[SPEAKER_01]: to train systems and basically You know
the top wire cord on that always had more
[SPEAKER_01]: betrayed us and And really was you know,
it never got below 50% on that But when we
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at the VSP, you know with none we
had a certain amount if we Removed the
[SPEAKER_01]: rachises.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some reduction with we shoot then
we got more reduction if we did than both,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they sort of had this Additive
effect And this is what the fruit looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know shoot thin versus non shoot
thin And Anna Katherine Mansfield refused
[SPEAKER_01]: to make wine out of the stuff on the right
Okay, so last example here and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that Is sort of a totally new
way of thinking about managing crop load
[SPEAKER_01]: on concord because concords are a
commodity crop and in high yield is you
[SPEAKER_01]: know high yield and low cost that's always
been the objectives that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting for so 2013 was a very heavy crop
year and And it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to Rich Erdl the director
Cooperative extension after excuse me grow
[SPEAKER_01]: relations at National Grape Cooperative
and That year a lot of their growers did
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical shoot thinning for the first
time or excuse me cluster things so 50% of
[SPEAKER_01]: our New York acres 33% of our Pennsylvania
acres mechanically thinned in July and as
[SPEAKER_01]: a result they were able to get eight to
nine tons and Deliver it early if they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't then they would have to wait till
the end of the season and it might not
[SPEAKER_01]: even get ripe So this is a huge economic
benefit in that one year and it goes back
[SPEAKER_01]: to foundational concepts of crop load done
by nelson shawless in the 60s and Then bob
[SPEAKER_01]: pool and terry bates followed it up with
minimal pruning terry refined it into kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a system And then they did lots of
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conservative estimate of the impact
was that it was nine million dollars in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2013 And just a note here's how They do it
you take your grape harvester out and you
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest 48 feet of row that's 1 1
hundredth of an acre you weigh the fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you go to this table to say well,
I got this much fruit and You know
[SPEAKER_01]: basically at the 30 days post bloom is
going to be you know half of what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to end up with at the end of the
season so then they can take their
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical harvester out and in early
August and you know thin it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: hasten the ripening or Avoid delaying the
ripening actually Depending on the the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what growers did and here's what
happened the purple bar is 2013 left side
[SPEAKER_01]: is the ones that then they got less yield
The end thin higher yield and this is from
[SPEAKER_01]: spray record, excuse me Harvest weight
records So when they thinned they kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: Evened out things they got less in 2013
more in 2014 in the end then they got a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot in 2013 but then they paid for it 2014
with much much lower yields so All told,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know averaged over several vineyards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worth a half a ton extra fruit to
them over the two years And this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: tribute to all the hard work that the Lake
Erie Squad has done over many many years
[SPEAKER_01]: to refine these concepts and You know,
it's interesting it's We get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: press for sort of new things that we do
But less it's it's it's harder to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with something that is a result of years
and years of sustained effort that Really
[SPEAKER_01]: finally has an impact hard to interest the
Cornell Chronicle and that stuff Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so Those are all my examples and So we
have a couple things, you know on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right side is what scientists like to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left side is what some of our
funding agencies and Like to do they like
[SPEAKER_01]: the metrics well, do we have metrics for
everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are times when we can do what
they suggest which is you know document
[SPEAKER_01]: how many growers have done this that or
the other But oftentimes that's hard to do
[SPEAKER_01]: And and what are the alternatives well
send out a survey to growers how much
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen you using this year how much and
I hate doing that because growers hate
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all those surveys so more often than
not we're just Reduced to saying things
[SPEAKER_01]: like well growers report that they're
doing something as a result of our efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, I know that Our extension
programs have had a huge extension and
[SPEAKER_01]: research programs have had a huge impact
on the industry helped Foster its growth
[SPEAKER_01]: development Ecologic and economic
sustainability, but sometimes that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to put into return on investment sort
of metrics So Again, this is the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've tried to do throughout my career
is these collaborative trials kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: heart of my extension effort and And
again, I believe you know the line between
[SPEAKER_01]: research and extension is best if it's
kept really really blurry But I've managed
[SPEAKER_01]: to over the course of my career have the
opportunity To work with so many great
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty members Tax extension qualities
and and growers So that's it and thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: for your attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Marvin The numbers you show make it
seem like I don't know if I would invest
[SPEAKER_02]: my money doing that So what do you advise?
[SPEAKER_02]: People to come to you now and say I'm
really interested
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, what do I advise people who say
geez I just want to grow grapes and and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a winery Well, there's a lot more
money in the value-added part of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: there isn't great point But I've had
examples of people you know that come to
[SPEAKER_01]: mind like a guy who came into my office in
1997 or 1998 and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pharmacist I want to grow grapes and
Mentally rolled my eyes and you know said
[SPEAKER_01]: well, are you aware of this this and this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Often I try and talk people out of it
because you know That's what you do but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you're 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a 50 acre vineyard loves growing
grapes and made a real success out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because He did his homework and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So So I guess telling him do your homework
and I guess a lot of people Really repeat
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you how do you make a small fortune
in the wine industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You start out with a large portion that
sort of thing But then you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another one boundary breaks
vineyard again This is a guy that came in
[SPEAKER_01]: and said, you know, I'm a wine geek I want
to make the best riesling in the world and
[SPEAKER_01]: how many times have I heard that or How
many people have you know sort of tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: but But he's successful and now you know
has 30 acres of grapes has a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: business He was very good at marketing
very very intentional about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You can make a success of it It's just
don't expect it to be easy or don't expect
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually be making money Until it's you
know, you're 11 years into it if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: winery And that's just exactly been his
his experiences that you know you invest a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of money up front and then So finally
it's starting to come back to him in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wine that he sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Don't know if that's a good answer,
but but Yes So kind of the question in
[SPEAKER_03]: with two different, you know audiences one
is When you talk to the grape growers
[SPEAKER_03]: about a practice that might have a
positive environmental impact but not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily an economic one How are you
talking to them about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second part is that when you
talk to the funders or work with the
[SPEAKER_03]: funding agencies How would you like them
to?
[SPEAKER_03]: assess positive environmental impacts
Because you were just mentioned economics
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they just want to know yeah Yeah,
but we know that there's a lot of positive
[SPEAKER_03]: we do a lot of work and show positive
environmental impacts from our work.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we To the growers and to the
funders Well, the growers are pretty easy
[SPEAKER_01]: sell and on it actually Because you know a
lot of them like if you're on Long Island,
[SPEAKER_01]: they say God I'm spending way too much
time on my spare.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get out of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that might be new varieties
that might be something else I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any you know had answers about this but
But it's the growers that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing us to do the environmental Impact
because they want to publicize the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that they use cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do any tillage, etc,
etc So, you know, they're kind of pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: us in a way So it's not a hard sell
Getting them to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more tempting to soft-pedal the parts
that are you know, maybe not so great with
[SPEAKER_01]: them With funders, I think you just have
to have a narrative that you tell them and
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how we're going to have any
huge Hard metrics that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to Talk about with with those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know No questions What comes next
for me Yeah, well One thing I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: right now that I just started last week is
I'm going to be a vineyard inspector for
[SPEAKER_01]: their third party sustainability program
from the New York wine grape foundation
[SPEAKER_01]: and This has been fun so far because the
last two years with kovat I've spent most
[SPEAKER_01]: of my time just sitting behind my computer
and writing stuff and not seeing anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: so now I get to go out and you know talk
to people and find out what what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and It's been interesting in just in
the first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out, you know, some people are
doing great stuff Some people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible stuff in part of their Operation,
you know, for example, I found a spray
[SPEAKER_01]: shed that had a bunch of squirrels living
in it You know at one place and then
[SPEAKER_01]: another another one where they've gotten
75% cost sharing from from NRCS to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: just a wonderful spray spray facility,
so So that's one of the things I like I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to stay involved somewhat with the
industry because I have a lot of friends
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry and and and That's really
the best part of it been the best part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the job for me So I don't know what I'm
gonna do marvin, but I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: something So and Elizabeth lamb would like
to know so what advice would you give to
[SPEAKER_00]: an emerging extension?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specialist or someone interested in
becoming one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay My impression is make a good
impression in the first two months Get out
[SPEAKER_01]: and meeting meet people Because they
always have a long memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they have a bad encounter That's
what they're gonna think about you for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of your career One of the keys for me
was just starting in right away with these
[SPEAKER_01]: trials and And people would see me out
there in the my in the car hearts and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know out collecting stuff and That's when
I realized okay, I might not know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill up a sprayer But I know how to
collect data Analyze it write about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what they Really value from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's my other piece of advice is
go out and collect some data generate some
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge yourself and I guess in my
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had a problem getting the faculty
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I always felt for my colleagues say
in Wisconsin or something where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: all out there by their self But here at
Cornell we had you know 10 or 11 different
[SPEAKER_01]: programs working on stuff and I didn't
mention it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of my most rewarding things the
last couple years been working with Bruce
[SPEAKER_01]: rice here on the Vitis gen project and
It's you know, and it's just great to an
[SPEAKER_01]: important For somebody in extension if
they're not taking advantage of the
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise on campus, you know,
I don't think they're doing their jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you

University on the web at Cornell edu You
