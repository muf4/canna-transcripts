[SPEAKER_04]: The weather is definitely becoming more
erratic and more extreme than what it had
[SPEAKER_04]: been in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that tendency, as others do,
that have lived a long time in the same
[SPEAKER_05]: place to say, well, the winters aren't as
cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not getting as much snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, it's been a surprise over the
last few years how much earlier the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons have become in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that it actually does seem
like the season gets hotter faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here at one of Cornell's apple
orchards.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York is well known for the quality of
its apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're usually second or third in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: in apple production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got there by farmers from over many
years really working with Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers to come up with best
management practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, now we're facing,
like farmers everywhere, new challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Challenges associated with climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, I never expected when I got
into this climate change research realm
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the 1990s that one of the most
important things that would come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: regard to the fruit crop growers is
actually cold and frost damage in a
[SPEAKER_02]: warming world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for that is that these plants
can sometimes be tricked into blooming
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier with a warming winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had known from looking at
historical records that the apples were
[SPEAKER_02]: blooming a few days earlier than they used
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in 2012, there was a real record
breaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The apples in the state bloom about four
weeks earlier than normal, never observed
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, this put them into a
really long period of frost risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, we lost close to half the
crop in much of the state, millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to deal with this sort of thing,
we have to think about things like frost
[SPEAKER_02]: risk warning systems for farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers may have to consider misting
systems or wind machines for frost
[SPEAKER_02]: protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our apple breeders may have to think
about coming up with genetic types that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't jump the gun in terms of early bloom
in warm winters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the experience of adapting to climate
change may be different for each farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, many of the state's
leading agricultural industries,
[SPEAKER_02]: which include dairy, grapes, apples and
fresh market produce, all face new
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges, new risks and new
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to climate change and
adaptation, farmers across New York all
[SPEAKER_02]: have a story to tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Dale Stein, senior partner in Stein
Farms in Leroy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We milk 850 cows, work almost 3000 acres
of land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we've had very heavy rain all
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got flood watches up all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen years where a drought where on
the gravel ground you get almost no yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually had two years in a row,
2011 and 2012 were too dry here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all our forages were lower production.
[SPEAKER_04]: We feed 75 tons of feed a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about four tractor trailer loads of
feed a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up by the end of 2012 running out
of our surplus forage.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used all that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We end up on those years buying more
grain, which increases our cost of
[SPEAKER_04]: production and lowers your profit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're harvesting 1500 to 2000 tons of
triticale every May that if I didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: that's extra on the same ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have that, we would have been
in a lot worse place than we were with out
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The forage inventory shortages that we've
had from extreme weather conditions in
[SPEAKER_03]: recent years is really just a sign of
things to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, farmers have to deal with a
change in climate each and every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in extension, we really try to help
farmers manage their risk and growing a
[SPEAKER_03]: triticale forage crop or another small
grain for forage can really give another
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to protect their resources
over the winter because they're more
[SPEAKER_03]: vulnerable to extreme precipitation
events.
[SPEAKER_03]: And losing that soil, we can protect the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice the fibrous root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why this crop can hold soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just see how much soil, even in this
couple inches of roots that this is
[SPEAKER_03]: holding on to.
[SPEAKER_04]: My standpoint from what I've seen on this
farm, triticale works very well for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the palatability is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cows love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an awesome combination of a
profitable crop that protects the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It baffles me why more farmers aren't
using more triticale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just baffles me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Paul King.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do most of the vineyard management and
most of the winemaking and all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: distilling here at Six Mile Creek
Vineyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been here for almost 25 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about climate change.
[SPEAKER_05]: A longer growing season and a little
hotter weather will ripen the fruit more
[SPEAKER_05]: dependably.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some varieties, and I can give
you two or three examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinot Noir is a little futsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Merlot for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to a lesser degree, Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these are varieties that will
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best management option for any
individual vineyard to deal with
[SPEAKER_05]: increasingly varying weather, if we talk
about climate change, would be to think
[SPEAKER_05]: carefully about the varieties that they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the biggest management
strategy, because everything else you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing is then a little bit of a sort of a
stop gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wind turbines help in only very specific
weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: Conditions where very calm conditions are
set up, and there's a deep gradient
[SPEAKER_05]: between the temperatures at the surface
and just a few hundred feet in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mixing up that layer can help a lot,
but they're pretty specific weather
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions, and it's a pretty costly
investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to grow the varieties that you
can grow well, and that's what you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is especially true at Six Mile Creek,
but it's also true for any of the other
[SPEAKER_05]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last winter was a particularly cold one,
and it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the minimum low temperature in
Ithaca is still probably minus 23 degrees
[SPEAKER_05]: Fahrenheit or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't really approach that,
but what we did see here were lots of
[SPEAKER_05]: excursions to minus 14, minus 15,
minus 16 degrees, and that is a very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very critical temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get significant bud loss
right around that threshold.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that going to have on the quality
and quantity of wine grapes that are grown
[SPEAKER_05]: in the region?
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly at Six Mile Creek Vineyard,
we have lost most of the Riesling fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: that we had here, as compared with our
Save All, a hybrid where we have virtually
[SPEAKER_05]: a full crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lack of name recognition of
some of these hybrids, Save All Blanc.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds a lot like Sauvignon Blanc,
but is that a Sauvignon Blanc?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not a Sauvignon Blanc.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a completely different variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get six ton per acre even here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's disease resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the first grape varieties to
ripen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful grape variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just relatively unknown.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the people that I know that
most enjoy wine really like trying new
[SPEAKER_05]: wines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a huge, huge outlet out there
for exploring some of the new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the Finger Lake Sportes.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the long run, that's going to serve to
help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Rod Farrow, one of the owners and
operators of Lamont Fruit Farm in
[SPEAKER_01]: Waterport, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We operate about 500 acres of apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow all kinds of varieties,
about 29 different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major varieties would be Empire,
Honeycrisp, Gala, Fugees, Sweet Tangos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've certainly moved our bloom time
forward probably at least five to seven
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some years, a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of this we can attribute to
climate change is still a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: debatable to me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's certainly a sense that things
are changing here and that the climate is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a little more unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the risk of early season and early
bloom seems to be greater and greater
[SPEAKER_01]: every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chances of a warm spell in March,
an extended warm spell, seem to be much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger now than they were 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say in general, our farm's
definitely vulnerable to extreme weather
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the mercy of Mother Nature no
matter what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, has the frequency
increased and the risk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly say they've been a lot of
extreme instances of weather over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 plus years here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a number of very large hail
storms, but certainly the frequency of
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been greater since 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that drives what you do
in terms of risk management is the
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability of your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a profitable business can afford to do
things to mitigate risk, whether that be
[SPEAKER_01]: invest in frost machines or try to choose
better orchard sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or add overhead cooling or overhead
irrigation frost protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the 2000s, the orchard business
has generally been pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly see an uptick in investment
in risk management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere we have reasonable sites or good
orchard sites, we've survived any frost
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've ever had, including 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look at it as a company strategy
that investing in the highest possible
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit sites or orchard sites has just as
big or if not greater economic impact than
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to mitigate a site that's going to
be at risk in years when it's cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly multi-parallel insurance can
help in years of distinct disaster and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make years that could be very,
very bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually years that you could not
necessarily thrive in, but you can at
[SPEAKER_01]: least survive through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're big believers in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strategies that are being used at the
moment to lower your risk are definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to preserve the economic viability
of fruit farms and businesses in general
[SPEAKER_01]: in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all climate change is negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So increasing the number of heat units per
season has a positive impact on what we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do for fruit size, potentially yield
and return bloom, tree health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always gains and balances with
anything we certainly have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher risk, but we also possibly have a
slightly higher potential in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and value.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jessica Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the assistant farm manager at the
Poughkeepsie Farm Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Poughkeepsie Farm Project is a
nonprofit that has an educational mission
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a working CSA farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not certified organic, but we do
try to use organic practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice climate change in terms of the
disease susceptibility of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen definitely an increase in
the number of different diseases and pests
[SPEAKER_00]: that can affect us here in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly when we have very extreme
weather events and certainly when we have
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of these very strange, you know,
very either early summers or very late
[SPEAKER_00]: summers or very, very late falls so that
it doesn't actually get to freezing until
[SPEAKER_00]: February.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sure that that extends how
strong the disease pressure can be the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year in the pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heat stress actually can be a big
factor for a lot of our brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, that's something you deal
with as a farmer and the changing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring to summer brassicas are always
going to be a challenge, but they're even
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a good indicator in terms of
crops because they do not like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in their weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much like the weather to
always be, you know, relatively mild,
[SPEAKER_00]: not too wet, not too dry and pretty much
the same temperature all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really just not what you get
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're already dealing with a change in
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what was it two years ago when
we would have 80 degree weather in early
[SPEAKER_00]: March and then go freezing in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy things can happen in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like predicting for
unpredictability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that kind of reinforces the fact
that we should have diversified market
[SPEAKER_00]: areas and also diversified crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be as diversified as the
CSA because certainly that can be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit overboard in some areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly to rely on one crop is,
you know, it's like playing a game of
[SPEAKER_00]: dice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes it's just not going to come
up your turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly if you don't have crop
insurance and even if you do have crop
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance, you know, it can be a very
risky, you know, game to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who are in the orchard
business in Ulster County and even they're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of going more into agro tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going more into different crops,
different specialty crops, just to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something on the side that they can rely
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of makes one as a farmer
more bold to say like, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just see how early we can get
tomatoes if it's going to be warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier or we'll see how late we can have
crops, you know, into the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably something else is going to
fail in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to also make sure that
our organic matter is high in our soils to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with so that it has that humus and
organic matter that's capable of holding
[SPEAKER_00]: water as well as as much as possible,
keeping our soil covered in a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: when we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even when we're tilling in that
cover crop to try and choose moments where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not losing too much soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly we're thinking about carbon
sequestration and being able to lock in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that carbon into our soils,
partially because it's good for the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: and partially because it's good for our
plants to have that much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a high carbon soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you come into the idea of
sustainable farming knowing that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to not, you know, ruin the planet
and trying to, you know, make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not, you know, you're not messing
things up too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, these are just some of the
experiences and challenges that farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the Northeast are dealing with
and adapting to climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have advantages in this region,
too, such as being relatively water rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with a longer growing season,
this could open up new opportunities for
[SPEAKER_02]: new markets and new crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here at Cornell and Cornell Cornell's
Institute of Climate Change and
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture, we are poised and ready to
take on climate change challenges and work
[SPEAKER_02]: with our grower partners, stay one step
ahead of the curve and take advantage of
[SPEAKER_02]: any opportunities that might come our way.
Thank you.
