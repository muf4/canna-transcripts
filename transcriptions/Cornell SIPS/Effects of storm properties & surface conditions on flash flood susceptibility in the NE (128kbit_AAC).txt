[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here and kick off the
seminar series.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little different from what I'm
doing now, but it's something that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: very enthusiastic about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, I can convey some of the
interesting things that I learned over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of an eight-year stint in BEE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about ways that the
atmosphere and the land landscape combine
[SPEAKER_00]: or interact to produce flash floods in the
Northeast U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the structure of my talk will just be
some background on flash floods and then
[SPEAKER_00]: describe my study methods and then talk
about the variability in what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in the atmosphere, what's happening in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I define some runoff types that
help us sort of address how flash floods
[SPEAKER_00]: work here in the Northeast U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a separate study that I'll talk
about just briefly is how people influence
[SPEAKER_00]: the prevalence of flash floods and then
tell you my conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the definition of a flood is fairly
intuitive for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where water is and that it usually
isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think of floods like in the Midwest
where acres and acres of cropland are
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded and it lasts for months and
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk about floods, river
floods, as water where we don't want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flooding our cities and our homes and
our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydrologists talk about floods in
different ways, but the definition that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using is the weather service
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is of a flash flood, which is a
flood that occurs within six hours of the
[SPEAKER_00]: onset of whatever caused the flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the floods I'm talking about is
precipitation, but it could also be
[SPEAKER_00]: something like snow melt or a dam break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flash floods are different from
river floods because they're quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the name sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They happen quickly and the inundation
might not last very long and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to pin down where and when the
flood happened and how long, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much area it covers and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that are more routinely
characterized for river floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to do for flash floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since flash floods are generally
reported by people, not by gauges or
[SPEAKER_00]: remote sensing, then there's a bias in
where they're reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're only reported if someone
notices and calls and says, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a flash flood here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get into a little more in a bit
about how I deal with these challenges of
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting and then delineating where flash
floods happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the motivation for studying flash
floods is fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flash floods cost lives and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Northeast, we see damages in the
millions of dollars every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, people die almost every
year in the Northeast as a result of flash
[SPEAKER_00]: floods, despite the public awareness
campaign of the National Weather Service
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may have seen the signs,
turn around, don't drown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a significant cause of death in terms
of weather related deaths throughout the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S., but you know, I'm focusing on the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what causes flash floods?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we already know before I got started
on my work, we know that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, we need sufficient water and
energy to produce heavy rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heavy rainfall could mean either
intense rainfall for a short period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could mean a longer period of time with
less intense rainfall that still results
[SPEAKER_00]: in a high volume of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the landscape, we know that higher
slopes lead to more flash floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that certain soil properties that
I'll get into more detail make a landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: more susceptible to flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we pave or in other ways make
land area impervious, that makes it so the
[SPEAKER_00]: water has nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't do a good job in routing
that water away from homes and buildings
[SPEAKER_00]: and crops and things, then the impervious
areas can be a problem because they
[SPEAKER_00]: generate more runoff and it has no place
to go and causes flash flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two runoff mechanisms that I'm
going to talk about, this is how
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrologists understand the conversion of
rainfall to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we produce in the atmosphere some
amount of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is one of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the rate of rainfall exceeds the
infiltration capacity of the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that excess is runs off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we have saturated areas in the
landscape, then any rain that falls on
[SPEAKER_00]: that saturated area has nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can also produce runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Northeast, saturation excess
has been shown to be the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff mechanism because our soils have a
high enough infiltration capacity relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rainfall intensity that generally,
usually, saturation excess is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism that causes the runoff that
makes streams run a little higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see flash floods are a special
case and generally, we think of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll also talk a little bit about that
concept of extreme too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so all of the landscape variables
that contribute to those two types of
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff are highly variable throughout the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see a range of saturated
hydraulic conductivity, which I'm using as
[SPEAKER_00]: a proxy for infiltration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ranges by an order of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depth of the soil, so the depth either
to bedrock or a restrictive layer or a
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent water table ranges quite a bit
from almost nothing to a meter and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the slopes in this area,
we have coastal plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are basically zero slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have places in Pennsylvania
and New York that are basically cliffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever driven in Pennsylvania,
you know that the slopes in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see also a great deal of
variation in impervious areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell just by looking at this
where the people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see that contrary to what an
Alaska girl thinks of the Northeast as
[SPEAKER_00]: being all this, all super populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have quite a few areas in this
region that don't have people in them
[SPEAKER_00]: really very much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's variation in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some landscape variables also vary in time
as well as space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of the soil moisture
product that I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the variability throughout
the region, but then also the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between what May typically looks like in
terms of soil moisture, what August
[SPEAKER_00]: typically looks like a little drier
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got time variance as well as
space variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the atmosphere, we have both
space and time variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to look at radar loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go through, this is one of
the flash floods that was in my study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that over time we have a
different, so the color ramp
[SPEAKER_00]: is radar reflectivity, which is related to
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of more red and purple
colors as intense precipitation and more
[SPEAKER_00]: blue and green colors as less intense
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white dot here is where the flash
flood happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the course of a couple of hours,
that dot goes from having basically no
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation to very intense
precipitation to no precipitation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a snapshot of what the
intensity looked like at one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: time, 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This outline is the watershed that
contributed to the flash flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that parts of the
watershed had no rainfall at that time and
[SPEAKER_00]: parts had very intense, 100 millimeters
per hour rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of variability in space and time,
multiple variables that we're studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really complicated system that
I'm trying to pin down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my research questions, the ones that
I'm gonna discuss today, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant mechanism of runoff contributing
to flash floods in the Northeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also going to address how
human infrastructure affects flash floods
[SPEAKER_00]: in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my data set consisted of 180 flash
flood events around the Northeast US.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose them from the NCDC storm events
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we don't have a lot of remote
sense, remotely sensed data or instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: sensed data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to go with what people reported
and entered into this database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the years 2003 through 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stuck with the warm season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to deal with snow melt,
which anyone who's ever done any hydrology
[SPEAKER_00]: knows snow melt is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also avoided tropical storms because
they behave differently in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we figured out where these
flash floods happened, we defined a
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed for each flood location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the contributing area to that flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within that watershed determined
the storm and watershed properties that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick word.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that comes up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, why don't you just look at
where floods happened at USGS gauges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you have more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the flow rate, you know the
duration of the flood, but flash floods
[SPEAKER_00]: happen on not only faster but also a
smaller scale than USGS gauges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example again of a flood
from my data set where the flood happened
[SPEAKER_00]: in this little watershed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there was a street here
that was flooded and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing area to that street flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nearest gauge is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any flooding that might have happened
may or may not actually show up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrograph here at the gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, in our data set, this
histogram shows the watershed area for the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark bars are our data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light bars are the USGS gauges around
the active USGS gauges around the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average watershed size for our data
set is about 75 square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average for the USGS gauges is
about 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about a very different
spatial scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, with remote sensing,
remote sensing has gotten very good at
[SPEAKER_00]: helping us understand where river floods
are happening, the degree of inundation
[SPEAKER_00]: and the time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the time and space resolution
of these products isn't good enough really
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to identify where flash floods
happen, how long they last, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little tour of the NCDC storm
events database.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tiny bit blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the database, you can query it for a
location, a date, and then the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: events that you want to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I filter by flash floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this example, this is Tompkins
County and 2006 to 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you get is a list of the flash
floods that occurred during that time
[SPEAKER_00]: period in that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that on some days,
there were more than one flood reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our data set, we only considered one
flood per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was more than one flood,
we took the worst flood, the one with the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest precipitation depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get into the results of this
database, you see time and place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you get in, there's a
narrative field where the person taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the report can give you more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the information is not very
descriptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says ditches overflowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes they give you an actual
pinpoint location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really helpful for me as a
hydrologist because I know for sure what
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed or contributing area was
responsible or contributing to that flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the best ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a map of our 180 events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some clustering of events
in places like Western Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_00]: down here in the sort of very populated
area around New York City, and some places
[SPEAKER_00]: where we don't see flash floods,
like the Adirondacks and north central
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we establish where the flood
happened, and like I said, if I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick a location that's an intersection
or a stream crossing or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that as my outlet for my watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can't do that, then I take previously
defined basins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're already delineated by the
National Weather Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whichever basin got the most rain,
that's the one that I consider as the
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing watershed for the flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I used ArcGIS hydrology tools and
a 10 meter DEM to delineate the watershed
[SPEAKER_00]: that contributes to each flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're familiar with flow
accumulation algorithms, then you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to know that ArcGIS uses an 8
meter direction algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it assumes that waterfalls,
it can flow in one of, it can flow like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, basically the compass directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for soil properties, I used mostly the
SIRGO soil database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got porosity calculated based on bulk
density, the saturated hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity, and all of these soil
properties were averaged over the
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for soil moisture, I used a land
surface model that accounts for
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation, evaporation, soil
properties, transpiration, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: calculates what the, models what the soil
moisture would be on a given day for a
[SPEAKER_00]: four kilometer grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used the top 10 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consider that sort of the most
hydrologically active area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the atmosphere, the storm properties,
we used a radar product that aggregates
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall data into these polygons that
are, they're hydrologic polygons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're based on, on actual land
surface, the elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to extract the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for, for my purposes, I counted the
maximum five minute rain rate anywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: the watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it rained, you know,
with looking over that spatial and
[SPEAKER_00]: temporal variability, whatever the most
intense rainfall was, that's the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then similarly, wherever in the
watershed, there was the most accumulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depth, we talk about precipitation in
inches or millimeters, wherever that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what I considered the amount of
precipitation for that flood event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of, it's worth noting that
as an exercise, I did do a more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: temporal and spatial analysis or model of
the two different runoff types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for infiltration excess, I used the
green and amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stamped equations and said for every 10
meter square, every 10 meter grid cell in
[SPEAKER_00]: a raster, what was the sum of the excess
rainfall over the infiltration capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: summed up over the whole storm and what
would be the total infiltration excess
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff from that, that calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for saturation, I used a, a model
based on the curve number to say the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for every 10 meter cell,
for the whole watershed, what was the sum
[SPEAKER_00]: of the saturation excess runoff based on
soil moisture storage and the rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This took me a couple of months to get all
of the products, all of the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: together for this one watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I needed a method that was less
computationally and sort of my time
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive to talk about the different
runoff mechanisms in the flash floods in
[SPEAKER_00]: our 180 flood data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came up with these indices where
basically for infiltration excess,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said if the maximum rainfall rate
anywhere in the watershed exceeds the
[SPEAKER_00]: average KSAT, then saturated hydraulic
conductivity, then we're going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rate ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the excess of rain rate over soil
infiltration capacity, which I know
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated hydraulic conductivity does not
equal soil infiltration capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm using it as a proxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, if the rainfall depth exceeds
the soil moisture deficit, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be our depth ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rain depth over the soil moisture
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I calculated the soil moisture deficit
as the soil moisture the day before the
[SPEAKER_00]: event, subtracted from the total soil
porosity, and then times the depth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to bedrock or permanent water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results of these analyses,
you can see the variability in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: These histograms are my data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I showed you a map of the whole
northeast, this is what my data set looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the impervious area was generally less
than 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slope was pretty variable, but around 10%
was the sort of typical value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturated hydraulic conductivity typically
right around between 50 and 100
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil depth right around a meter
typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some variation in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also quite a bit of variation in
the storm property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is the maximum rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the maximum depth for the storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that most of the storms
were pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 millimeters an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lots of them were not very intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind as we
talk about what's causing flash floods in
[SPEAKER_00]: this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to sort of point out for
reference, the storms in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every year we would expect to see a
storm that's around 85 millimeters per
[SPEAKER_00]: hour at some point in the storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a total daily accumulation of about 50
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's normal for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a reference of where
these storms fall with respect to a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I looked at the rate ratio and the
depth ratio, I came up with these
[SPEAKER_00]: quadrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, if the rate ratio is greater
than one, I would expect to see some
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltration excess runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the depth ratio was greater than
one, I would expect to see some saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: excess runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have these other quadrants
where maybe both runoff mechanisms are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a very interesting
quadrant because we can't identify either
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism happening by my methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have some ideas about why things
might be flooding down in that quadrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how it breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: About half of the events were infiltration
excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 37% can't identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 3% saturation excess, 13%,
both mechanisms are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spatial distribution of these
mechanisms or combinations of mechanism,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see sort of a spread of the
mechanisms throughout the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have these clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these clusters are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that more just in
terms of figuring out why flash floods are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in this area, if we're seeing
both infiltration excess and saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: excess, then we know that this is an
especially vulnerable area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the number of events that are
happening in Western Pennsylvania also
[SPEAKER_00]: suggests that it's vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sort of question that I'm
trying to get at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we having these events here
that have neither especially high rate
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios or especially high depth ratios?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it flooding here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Eastern PA and New Jersey,
we're seeing a cluster of events that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen because of infiltration excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look at these variables again
and look at the clusters and sort of start
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop some hypotheses about why we're
seeing what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, some of the shallowest
soils in the Northeast are happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: this Northwestern Pennsylvania area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would make sense, given my
assertions here about mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: that saturation excess would be a likely
mechanism here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not especially high hydraulic
conductivities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing intense rainfall and
infiltration excess runoff is not maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: too surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cluster here of infiltration
excess, we have a lot of people living
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the flash floods are happening
largely because of impervious area and
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it's because the saturated
hydraulic conductivity is a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is an area where I think there's
still a lot of room for more research just
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of, like I said, developing some
hypotheses based on this structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff mechanisms and then testing them
with models or with spatial statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at those histograms of the
rate and depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the storms in this data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was struck by the fact that many of
the events were not especially intense and
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the events were not especially
high in total precipitation depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at the return period or the
recurrence interval of the storms that
[SPEAKER_00]: caused these floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that half or more of the
events are actually quite common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the accumulation or the depth,
half of them are at least as frequent as
[SPEAKER_00]: the five-year storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than half in terms of rate,
so the intensity of the storm,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than half of the storms were at least
as frequent as the five-year storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing flash floods happening
because of events that are fairly common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think of flash floods as an extreme
event, but they're actually not that
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual in terms of the probability or the
frequency of the storm that's causing
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we seeing so many flash floods in
places where these storms are not
[SPEAKER_00]: especially uncommon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it has to do with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it has to do with the
information infrastructure that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: built.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my little joke, but it's not even a
very good joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a flood happens when there's no one
around, was it a flood?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really only care about flash floods
when they affect us, when they flood our
[SPEAKER_00]: property, when they hurt people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this bias toward flash
floods that happen in places where people
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paces where people have paved things and
probably developed some stormwater
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure of some kind to deal with
excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we carefully design our stormwater
systems, then this could help mitigate
[SPEAKER_00]: flash floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're for, is to get the
water off the road, to get the water off
[SPEAKER_00]: the parking lot or the places that it's
not supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that doesn't always work so
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We pave things, we dig ditches,
we build culverts and municipal stormwater
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my research projects was
looking deeper into one aspect of this
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, which is road culverts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at a whole bunch of culverts
in several watersheds in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hudson River Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what's the capacity of this
culvert?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water can this culvert handle at
its maximum flow rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what storm would produce that
much rainfall to max out that culvert's
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a culvert?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a barrel, like metal or plastic
barrel, that goes under the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a ditch, an open ditch,
and then a pipe, and then an open ditch on
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, so it serves to get the
water under the road, and then it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: open ditch on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a city, everything would be
underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in more rural areas, we just have
these open ditches, and then the culvert
[SPEAKER_00]: gets the water under the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the capacity of these
culverts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water can it convey at its
maximum?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then which storm, return period,
would exceed, meet or exceed that
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I color coded them because people
like to see simple ways of visualizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: results of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually gave these maps to the
cities or towns that were in or close to
[SPEAKER_00]: these watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, these dark red culverts are
your problem areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that are gonna flood
the most frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from this map that quite a
few of them are in the orange and red
[SPEAKER_00]: range, which means that they're likely to
be inundated or exceeded every one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sounds like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that this is actually
verified by the people who live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, yeah, this culvert backs up,
floods the road every year or every other
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems kind of extreme, but it's true
in some places anyway, that these culverts
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't actually designed for the amount of
runoff that's reaching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have good records of every
time this culvert floods because people
[SPEAKER_00]: only report it if it's extreme or if they
notice or if they care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know here in the Ithaca area,
I talked to people from Lansing who say
[SPEAKER_00]: their driveway floods every year or two
years, or the ditch fills up and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: hits the road every year or two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of right on the cusp of
infrastructure failures really frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a lot of different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, first of all, we can get people to
report these floods or culvert failures
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would maybe look like smartphone
pictures uploaded and sent to the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be geotagged so that we'd know
exactly where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be more like an app where people
can put in their intersection where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are and say, there was a flood here on
this day at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we had more detailed information
about this, this is my sort of engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: remotely calculated way of saying which
culverts are vulnerable, but if we could
[SPEAKER_00]: have actual records of which culverts are
flooding, that would be even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could give that information to
the city planners and they could decide if
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a little money, which they
usually don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say they get some, they can
prioritize which culverts to repair or
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the bad news is that it's not
going to get any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting more intense rainfall
in the Northeast and in a lot of places in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rare storms, so I already said that
these flush floods are happening because
[SPEAKER_00]: of not very rare storms, but rare storms
are becoming less rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see even more flash
floods if my assessments of why these
[SPEAKER_00]: things are happening are true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that in a lot of places
our infrastructure is not adequate and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be even worse as we get more
and more rainfall, either more intense or
[SPEAKER_00]: more total rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that leads to more floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does all this wrap up to mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I think that I found evidence
for both runoff mechanisms, infiltration
[SPEAKER_00]: excess and saturation excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infiltration excess seems to happen more
often in the Northeast for flash floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular storms, I think we can still argue
that saturation excess is the dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism, but these are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flash floods are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so high intensity rainfall or high
accumulation can cause flash floods
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the impervious areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that not all flash floods
require especially intense or especially
[SPEAKER_00]: high accumulation rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is important because a lot of
research into flash floods is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: these intense storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying that we need to be looking
at the landscape too and look at places
[SPEAKER_00]: that are vulnerable due to slope
properties, due to slopes and impervious
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we consider all of these landscape
properties while we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable areas, then we and also find a
way to talk about this time and space
[SPEAKER_00]: variable soil moisture, which is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find a way to incorporate that into
our assessments of the susceptibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: any given watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to be better prepared to
forecast when and where flash floods are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found that runoff types are
spatially clustered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, where we build stormwater
infrastructure, how well we design it
[SPEAKER_00]: matters a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects a lot when and where flash
floods are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research that still needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, like I said, the clustering of
these runoff types is provocative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of work could still be
done on figuring out what the causes are,
[SPEAKER_00]: why these runoff types are clustering in
geographic areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this can help us get to,
is a particular area more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity rainfall or high depth,
or maybe it's susceptible to both,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe we need to start looking at
reasons why small, not very rare storms
[SPEAKER_00]: are causing flash floods in a given area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it would be interesting
to do more in-depth case studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the one that I did at the 10 meter
resolution, just to get an idea of any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of any given watershed you could say,
you know, this watershed is more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: have infiltration excess or saturation
excess runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the more we understand what's
going on in the landscape, the better we
[SPEAKER_00]: can prepare for which storms are going to
be likely to cause flash floods in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
