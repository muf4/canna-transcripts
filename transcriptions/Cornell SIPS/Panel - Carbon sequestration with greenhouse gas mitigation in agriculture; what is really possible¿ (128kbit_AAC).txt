[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a really exciting panel discussion
today on the topic of GHG emissions from
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture as it pertains also to carbon
sequestration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to bound this this topic a little bit
by consideration of what's really possible
[SPEAKER_06]: and essentially looking back in
retrospective mode to see sort of what's
[SPEAKER_06]: changed over the last decade, what we've
learned, and having some critical thoughts
[SPEAKER_06]: about how we move forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a really fantastic panel here
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornell has the advantage of having global
expertise in global carbon cycling,
[SPEAKER_06]: atmospheric dynamics, all the way down to
soil scientists who work both at the
[SPEAKER_06]: fundamental level, but also on agronomic
management options.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have the good fortune of having
four of our really global leaders in this
[SPEAKER_06]: area join us today for the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Natalie Mahwald, who's an Irving
Porter Church professor in earth and
[SPEAKER_06]: atmospheric sciences.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Peter Woodbury, who is a senior
research associate in soil and crop
[SPEAKER_06]: sciences within SIPs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Dominic Wolf, who's also a senior
research associate in soil and crop
[SPEAKER_06]: sciences in SIPs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have Johannes Lehmann, who's the
Liberty High Bailey professor also in soil
[SPEAKER_06]: and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a really fantastic panel today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say that this is really timely to
have this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't go 30 seconds if you're paying
attention to the scientific media,
[SPEAKER_06]: mass media on these things, without a
mention of the agenda of agriculture or
[SPEAKER_06]: the potential role for agriculture to
reduce net GHG emissions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a lot of contention around how
we get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the panel today is meant to point us
in that direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it will go is that we're going to
have four lightning talks in the order
[SPEAKER_06]: that I introduced the speakers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to pivot to a panel
discussion that will take us to about
[SPEAKER_06]: 1.20.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the final 10 minutes or so will
be open questions from the audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please keep those in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Type them in the chat if you have to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll pivot to them at the end of the
session today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with no further ado, I think that
Dominic, you're in the lead on
[SPEAKER_06]: transitioning between slides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone else, please make sure that
your mics are muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And away we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the panel for pulling this
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ender, for moderating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm up next here, since my slide
is on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to emphasize, I'm not a
soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to emphasize is really,
what do we need to do to meet the low
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon targets?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Natalie Mohoel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to talk about my own
personal work with Earth System Science or
[SPEAKER_02]: climate models.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really just going to present the IPCC
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we need to do to meet the results
here and the context for soil
[SPEAKER_02]: sequestration?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we need to do to meet the low
carbon targets?
[SPEAKER_02]: One really important point that I find
that a lot of people don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: understand is climate change has really
long time scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what we're trying to get
after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this slide, this is a classic
climate change kind of slide where we
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: The x-axis is 1,850 out to 2,100 here in
the middle or 2,300 to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the kind of view I have of the
world, these really long time scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the y-axis, that's the temperature
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see up to 2005 for this
particular plot from the last IPCC
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment report.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the historical time series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now we're at a crossroads where
we can go on the red trajectory,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be business as usual,
which 2,100 might be four degrees C,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2,308 degrees or more C, versus if we act
right now and we completely change our
[SPEAKER_02]: economy and start sequestering carbon as
much as possible, that's this lowest blue
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really we're acting now to have an
impact at 2,100 or later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really difficult problem for
politicians to get their head around,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also for humans to get their head
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really important to understand
climate change has a really long time
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other point to make is that it is the
cumulative CO2 emissions, which is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: x-axis here, that linearly relates to the
temperature anomaly relative to
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-industrial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a little bit of noise up and
down in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see from short-lived gases like
methane or aerosols or exactly the
[SPEAKER_02]: trajectory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But almost all of this is CO2 emissions
are dominating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, nitrous oxide emissions also have a
really long lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could also be included here,
but are much, much smaller in magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason we only think about the
cumulative CO2 is because of the really
[SPEAKER_02]: long lifetime of CO2, which is thousands
of years, and how much CO2 we emit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the really important thing to
understand is that until our net
[SPEAKER_02]: anthropogenic CO2 emissions go to zero,
we will continue to have climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the Paris Agreement, we're going for
three or three and a half degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to cause most of our climate
change?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's developing countries, if they use our
pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how we got here,
to our wealth and our lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_02]: is by emitting a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And developing countries, of course,
want to have our lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to have our long lifetimes
with really good health care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, OK, maybe we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have better health care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an incredible thing is happening right
now, or was before COVID, is we might
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be able to eradicate extreme
poverty by 2030.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the sustainable development
goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see this in this slide,
again, going from 1820 to 2015,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the number of people in extreme
poverty has actually gone down over the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be great if this happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bad part is that right now,
they're following our development path.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're following our pathway,
which is the cheap way to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has emitted a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the real dilemma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's climate change versus development for
a lot of the people on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we need to do to meet the low
carbon target, given that developing
[SPEAKER_02]: countries want to develop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here, again, is one of these long
time series plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have to do on the y-axis here
is our CO2 emissions per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to stop emitting from fossil fuel
sources here and turn our economy around
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we're not using so much CO2,
not using fossil fuels, using renewables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can switch to low carbon energy
sources right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the developed countries need
to lead on this with solar and wind and
[SPEAKER_02]: developing the battery technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also need to cut energy demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to change our behavior to reach
any of these low carbon targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to develop new technologies
There's quite a bit of CO2 emissions that
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have substitutes for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solar and wind aren't substitutes for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really importantly that I think a lot
of people don't understand is because the
[SPEAKER_02]: developing countries are developing right
now and because the CO2 emissions are so
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to substitute for some things,
we have to develop carbon dioxide removal
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the recent IPCC reports
have made this so abundantly clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the technologically easiest are the
land-based natural methods that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to talk about today and how good are
they and how useful are they.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're probably also going to need
technological methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the really important thing to
understand is that carbon dioxide removal
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be necessary for any of our
carbon targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Peter Woodbury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have the next section of our
short presentations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're talking about carbon
sequestration in agriculture, focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly on soil carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to flip the script for a moment
and say, as many of you know, if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been involved with agriculture,
there are many reasons to add organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter or carbon to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, greenhouse gas mitigation may not
be anywhere near the top of most people's
[SPEAKER_00]: lists for the reasons to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about improving soil
health or soil quality, reducing erosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing compaction, improving the
infiltration of the soil for water,
[SPEAKER_00]: improving drainage, and increasing water
holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are among many, many functions that
can improve with improved soil health due
[SPEAKER_00]: to additions of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing is maintaining or
increasing crop yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important, obviously,
for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the climate change context,
it's important because of leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea being, if we can have
increased sustainable intensification and
[SPEAKER_00]: increased crop production on the lands
that we have through both yield increases
[SPEAKER_00]: and through intensification of cropping
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having crops on the land more of the
time, we reduce the pressure globally and
[SPEAKER_00]: regionally to cut down forests to have new
crop land available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the connection here between crop
yield and production and greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we're here today to
talk about sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about how that's
temporary, that if you can add carbon to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, it can also be lost again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we just heard, we have a very
long-term problem in climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need long-term solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're putting carbon in the soil,
we need it to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of another way to
think about this leakage idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing that as grass yield
increases, the greenhouse gas emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: per unit of yield per ton of grass
production decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wouldn't be a decrease on the area of
cropland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any greenhouse gas benefit of this
would have to be this idea of avoiding
[SPEAKER_00]: leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one topic that's discussed frequently
in terms of agricultural soil carbon is
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is indeed possible to reduce or
eliminate tillage in many systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is that the soil carbon that's
added can easily be lost again if tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of discussion of cover
cropping in the US and some other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to focus instead on double
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is the idea of sustainable
intensification by increasing the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of crops in a cropping cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New York state, that might mean
adding a double crop over the winter to
[SPEAKER_00]: what's normally a single crop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we get these same benefits of
adding organic matter to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also might be able to scavenge and
reduce some nutrient loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we can increase soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much as I love soil, I also love trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to mention them because storing
soil carbon is not only temporary,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also hard to measure and verify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to know whether a benefit's
occurring, it's quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees are easier to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be visually assessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can assess the amount of carbon
with a limited number of measurements of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trees and calculating the amount of
carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another possibility for carbon
sequestration in agriculture in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to soils is adding trees, one way or
another, to agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York state of a silvopasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's grazing livestock, but also
growing fence posts to keep the livestock
[SPEAKER_00]: contained and growing black walnuts as a
longer term crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a cropping system that has
livestock, tree production, grazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also is sequestering carbon in the
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many other ways to add trees to
agricultural landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these have multiple benefits
in addition to carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my final slide for my section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from a paper on natural
climate solutions globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a selection of some of the
pathways from this publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear more about biochar
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservation agriculture is what is,
roughly speaking, also regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these would be practices such as cover
cropping and reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two bars here, one for
peatland restoration and one for avoided
[SPEAKER_00]: peatland impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is for the very high
carbon soils that have the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a great deal of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they deserve special attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trees and cropland, this was just a
limited choice of growing alleys of trees
[SPEAKER_00]: among crop fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's additional opportunities that
are not shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest bars are avoided forest
conversion and reforestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why am I showing those when our topic
is agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is because the only way that
these can be implemented is by increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production on current
agricultural lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is taking low quality land out of
grazing, a small fraction, about 4%
[SPEAKER_00]: globally, and replanting it in trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reforestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That requires that we produce the
livestock more efficiently on a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agriculture improves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improved production is the way that we
can achieve both of these forest pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm also going to talk a little
bit about soil carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as Peter's mentioned, there are many
reasons apart from climate change why we
[SPEAKER_04]: might want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It provides a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to focus on, in this little
talk, about its climate impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Natalie set it up nicely with
the point about the fact that we really
[SPEAKER_04]: need to think in terms of long term
temperature changes depend on your overall
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the net amount of CO2 emitted or
removed from the atmosphere that will
[SPEAKER_04]: determine your long term temperature rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that in mind, how much can we
actually store in soils?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's hard to sort of open a
newspaper or anything these days without
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing someone talking about how massive
the potential is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one modeling study.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have used others.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use this one because it's a recent study
myself, Johannes and some other
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborators have just produced,
which will be available on our website
[SPEAKER_04]: soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took the IPCC model and ran it
globally to see if we, on crop plans,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, on every piece of crop land
in the world, if we did all we could do in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of increasing organic matter inputs
and in terms of reducing soil disturbance
[SPEAKER_04]: and no till, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: On grasslands, if we managed all of our
grasslands so that we brought them up to
[SPEAKER_04]: native grassland quality with a lot of
carbon stored in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of degraded grasslands
where that could be reversed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Third panel that we're called rewilding is
just as a thought exercise in a sense to
[SPEAKER_04]: see what is the ultimate potential if we
removed all humans from the planet and
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed all of our agricultural lands to
go back to their native natural condition,
[SPEAKER_04]: how much carbon would that store?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bottom side, I'm probably going to
spend too much time concentrating on just
[SPEAKER_04]: to be aware that of course it can go the
other direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we continue to degrade our agricultural
lands as we have been, we could lose up to
[SPEAKER_04]: over a hundred petagrams of carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a petagram of carbon, same as a
billion tons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, these sound like massive numbers
and they're driving a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the projections to 30
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the whole soil depth down
to two meters, it could be maybe three
[SPEAKER_04]: times that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these give you a sense of just what
scale we could do in terms of withdrawing
[SPEAKER_04]: down carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a lot though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have to reflect on just how large
the climate change problem is that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really have an emissions problem that
we need to tackle.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the moment, it's average emissions over
the last decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been close to 11 petagrams of carbon
as CO2 per year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we stored as much carbon as we could
in the world's crop lands, that would
[SPEAKER_04]: avoid roughly 16 months of current
emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's only CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even our other greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in grasslands, 14 months of CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Removing all humans from the planet is
maybe three and a third years.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we talk about the full depth of the
profile, maybe a decade of emissions that
[SPEAKER_04]: we could be stored.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think these numbers are quite...
They give us pause to actually reflect on
[SPEAKER_04]: the fact that we need to focus on
emissions with the most urgency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because any delay in reducing emissions
can quickly, within a matter of months,
[SPEAKER_04]: outdo anything that we could achieve over
a century in terms of ambitious programs
[SPEAKER_04]: of soil carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_04]: In agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So reducing emissions is the absolute
imperative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, if you like, icing on the
cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Natalie mentioned, we need to draw
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We aren't going to get to a stable,
habitable climate without also removing
[SPEAKER_04]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we really need to be cognizant of just
what soil carbon sequestration can achieve
[SPEAKER_04]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd also like to make the point that
soil carbon sinks are actually quite a
[SPEAKER_04]: risky place of putting carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter mentioned this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that you put into the soils,
if you return to business as usual,
[SPEAKER_04]: practices can be lost again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, it's not simply that there's
a risk of return to business as usual,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the more soil organic carbon you put
in the soils, if you put it there as soil
[SPEAKER_04]: organic matter, that soil organic matter
also contains other nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: notably phosphorus and nitrogen,
but others as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which historically far farmers have
accessed these nutrients by tilling their
[SPEAKER_04]: soil organic matter and turning it into
plant food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more you build up again,
in fact, the more you increase the
[SPEAKER_04]: incentives to actually reverse some of
these gains that you had.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not only risky because we might
stop, but it's risky because people may
[SPEAKER_04]: actually want to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also risky because these incentives
to reverse could actually play out in a
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer's favour if they decided to reverse
any gains and they get paid again to
[SPEAKER_04]: sequest carbon to the same land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it's risky in the sense that there
are huge incentives to do things like
[SPEAKER_04]: moving carbon from one place to another.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, if you're getting paid
carbon credits for storing carbon,
[SPEAKER_04]: you only put into that carbon scheme the
land that is storing it, but you build
[SPEAKER_04]: soil carbon out of place by moving your
crop residues, your manure and something
[SPEAKER_04]: else from other places.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get paid to store carbon that you've
actually risk relocated and you haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: actually put anything new into the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the third thing I'd like to
highlight in terms of things we need to be
[SPEAKER_04]: careful about with soil organic carbon as
a sink is that it's really just not a very
[SPEAKER_04]: efficient way of using biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of if you add a tonne of
carbon in the form of biomass into your
[SPEAKER_04]: soils, after a hundred years, around a
percent of that might be left.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends depending on your climate and
the quality of the biomass itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long, the exact percentage,
but it's a very small fraction of that
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon will remain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of it will be respired by microbes
over the course of that century and even
[SPEAKER_04]: more into the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas if we took the same biomass
converted to biochar, about 40% of that
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon would remain after a hundred years
in the biochar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus we can get other benefits from things
like avoiding nitrous oxide emissions from
[SPEAKER_04]: soils and producing, co-producing energy
with at the same time, fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we only burn that biomass to make
bioenergy, we could offset a lot of fossil
[SPEAKER_04]: fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't get any carbon storage,
but the mitigation potential is still very
[SPEAKER_04]: much larger than adding that biomass to
soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's expensive to do, but in terms of
the most efficient way we know of really
[SPEAKER_04]: to use that biomass at the moment is if we
both store most of that carbon by pumping
[SPEAKER_04]: underground in the form of CO2 and release
energy while converting it to CO2,
[SPEAKER_04]: which can offset fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get a very much more efficient use
of that same biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, economists often think in terms
of something they call an opportunity
[SPEAKER_04]: cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we want to say that building solar
carbon is a net gain for the climate,
[SPEAKER_04]: that really depends on what we see as
being the alternative, the best
[SPEAKER_04]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best alternative if we're just
squandering that carbon rather than that
[SPEAKER_04]: solar carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course it's a gain, but if we look
at it relative to the other ways,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might use that carbon more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it's a detriment, it's a loss to
a climate mitigation because you've
[SPEAKER_04]: squandered away the opportunity to do very
much more with that same carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, just one last slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to finish on a more positive note
is that soil carbon is not just soil
[SPEAKER_04]: organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So biochar obviously very much more
stable, although it's expensive to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a carbon price to actually
drive that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because it's much more stable,
we can build up stocks very much more
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly and we can we know that they will
be there for very much longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another on the right hand side,
enhanced weathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're looking at the inorganic
carbon cycle, adding basic rocks ground up
[SPEAKER_04]: to agricultural soils, they react with
carbon dioxide dissolved in groundwater in
[SPEAKER_04]: the weathering reaction to produce
carbonates and bicarbonates, which then
[SPEAKER_04]: store the carbon in inorganic form.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a very large global potential
to do those, storing that carbon safely
[SPEAKER_04]: away long term and combating ocean
acidification at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pass over to Johannes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks for organizing, Andy and
Natalie, for steering us into this and
[SPEAKER_03]: setting us up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to give you some messages
first, Dominic, if you give me the next
[SPEAKER_03]: slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some random, maybe seemingly random
sound bites that I want to close this
[SPEAKER_03]: first round, Robin.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that there's a big difference
between the actual removal, so the carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: that's sequestered and greenhouse gas
emission reductions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there might be trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will show you some slides about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there's food production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, as Peter so correctly mentioned,
and that might be what the farmer is all
[SPEAKER_03]: after, whereas maybe society and
policymaking is after the others as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there might be trade-offs equally,
but also some synergies, but not always
[SPEAKER_03]: synergies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really a large controversy around
achievable targets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might have heard about the four
per mill initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that starts to be more of the
vernacular on the street, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_03]: that these goals are being more
aspirational and inspirational.
[SPEAKER_03]: That then actually goals that can be
achieved at any place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the focus shifting more from the
actual carbon accrual to soil health
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: When looking at the organic carbons,
really not about locked away, but the
[SPEAKER_03]: persistence is a result of functional
complexity that needs constant care rather
[SPEAKER_03]: than a one-time sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's spatial questions that are still
ignored, and I'll show you something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dominic just mentioned inorganic
carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I show you no slides about that
because there is not very much to be shown
[SPEAKER_03]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really need to figure this out as
well and fold it into this discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now here is why I tell you this in the
next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the four per mill Paris Accord was
really a political move and has made a
[SPEAKER_03]: world of difference and you might be very,
very critical and you should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a shit storm of publication
flurry at some point that has died down
[SPEAKER_03]: luckily a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a world of difference for
somebody like me who went to the UN
[SPEAKER_03]: conventions and political meetings for now
15 years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you talked about soil carbon in the
2000s, everybody would laugh you out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now soil carbon, even Natalie talks
about soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even atmospheric scientists are talking
about soil organic carbon now,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really a massive change from 10,
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The four per mill is really just a
calculation of thinking through what is
[SPEAKER_03]: the net emissions between what we have in
emissions from fossil fuel emissions
[SPEAKER_03]: versus the uptake in oceans and land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the missing one to balance the budget
at the time was about equating to four per
[SPEAKER_03]: mill of soil carbon stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no further thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it started accelerating a
discussion that puts more fine points on
[SPEAKER_03]: what's actually achievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: The concept of why do we have organic
carbon in soil has fundamentally changed
[SPEAKER_03]: and what it looks like has fundamentally
changed over the last decade or so from
[SPEAKER_03]: recalcitrance at that point of so-called
humic substances and humus to a much more
[SPEAKER_03]: nuanced understanding of decomposition and
mineralization phenomena in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The importance of mineral stabilization
and aggregate stabilization of organic
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon and more the importance of what's
called functional complexity of the pore
[SPEAKER_03]: structures, the temporal dynamics,
and the diversity of organic matter in
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, which all relates and says that we
need to think about this as an ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil, and to achieve greater
persistence, we really need to manage that
[SPEAKER_03]: entire ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't mean we can put something
in and forget about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really that constant care versus
one-time sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we need to think about soil
carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about soil carbon and the dichotomy
or synergy of greenhouse gas emission
[SPEAKER_03]: reductions and soil carbon accrual and
actual CDR, carbon dioxide removal from
[SPEAKER_03]: the atmosphere, here illustrated with
biochar systems that have multiple moving
[SPEAKER_03]: parts, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Introducing pyrolysis and biochar into an
agro ecosystem means that we can offset
[SPEAKER_03]: fossil fuels due to biomass fuels that
reduces fossil fuel emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The transformation of an easily
decomposing material into something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar will reduce emissions off that
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then also the biochar can have effects
on carbon that's already in the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: other greenhouse gases, methane and
nitrous oxide, and of course, increase or
[SPEAKER_03]: change, sometimes decrease crop production
and lead to additional or less
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you already see the story between CDR
and GHG emission reductions is not a
[SPEAKER_03]: straightforward one, but there are systems
such as biochar and the others as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where all of those play a role and are
potentially synergistic if we're
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing soil health and increasing
photosynthesis or antagonistic as I will
[SPEAKER_03]: show in the next slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can look at, in the next slide,
the relationship between systems
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse gas emission reductions here on
the X axis versus actual soil carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: accrual CDR on the Y axis and plot some of
the major and divergent or very different
[SPEAKER_03]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crop land management is really a system
where we manage inherent carbon such as
[SPEAKER_03]: through less tillage or growing more
diverse crops and crop residue management
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're dealing with carbon that's
already in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas biochar is potentially a lateral
and most often a lateral transfer of
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon and input.
[SPEAKER_03]: And behaves therefore very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas restored wetland is a system where
you're reducing the output more than
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing the input.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that the relationship between
system greenhouse gas emissions reductions
[SPEAKER_03]: and soil carbon accrual look very
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas biochar has tilts more towards a
greater greenhouse gas emission reduction
[SPEAKER_03]: at about the same carbon accrual restored
wetland is sort of on the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That also is an interesting way to look at
it on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you plot the soil carbon accrual,
so more carbon sequestration in soils
[SPEAKER_03]: against food production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you see very clearly in most
restored wetlands, we would assume that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're displacing wetlands with
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it happened at all and therefore we
typically see a reduction in food
[SPEAKER_03]: production and a negative relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas with crop land management,
we probably would always very often assume
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have more yield with more carbon
and soil, although it plateaus at some
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that there might be a negative
relationship between those two as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in biochar with adding carbon,
we're probably in most cases increase
[SPEAKER_03]: though probably not linearly, probably
asymptotic increase yields and food
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas with fertilizer, we probably
increase food production, but in many
[SPEAKER_03]: cases not accrue more carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though there's interesting debates about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To close, I wanna make the point about the
spatial redistribution of resources and
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon and nutrients and that hasn't been
done really at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sort of recognize that this is a
landscape issue, that carbon is moving
[SPEAKER_03]: around the landscape and can be allocated
in different areas, especially if we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about waste biomass, especially if
we're talking about nutrient rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here an example from poultry litter and
the conversion with thermochemical
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: The example of the state of Georgia in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: where the phosphorus resources with
poultry are very differently distributed
[SPEAKER_03]: in the state than the phosphorus demands
and therefore the biochar needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can find different optima between
emission reductions, profit and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: and total carbon dioxide sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would plan your conversions and
your collection stations across the state
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very differently if you would
prioritize profit versus greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_03]: emission reductions versus carbon
sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those analysis have done only been
incipiently and they certainly lead both
[SPEAKER_03]: to opportunities for trade-offs and for
some synergies, but that's really at the
[SPEAKER_03]: start of it only.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was it from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Johannes and Peter,
Dominic and Natalie.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna pivot now to asking a couple
of questions from my side to the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll kind of try to keep that short so
that we at least have five to 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: for the audience to chime in.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to the panel, I'd like to ask you
first, what you think are some potential
[SPEAKER_06]: game changers in land use based strategies
for GHG mitigation that could be
[SPEAKER_06]: prioritized by the donor communities,
private companies and also younger
[SPEAKER_06]: scientists, perspectives on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we've mentioned a couple
of potential game changers already in the
[SPEAKER_04]: talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I won't go on again about inorganic
carbon and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of things that we could add
really are one is recognizing that the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse gas emission profile from
agriculture is more about nitrous oxide
[SPEAKER_04]: than it is about the carbon story and the
potentials there are massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, most of that is focused on the fact
that about 45 percent of nitrogen that we
[SPEAKER_04]: add to fields end up in a harvested crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we can incrementally improve
that, improve that nitrous efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the real game changer in that system,
I think, is actually looking at the food
[SPEAKER_04]: system as a whole, where less than 10
percent, probably about seven or eight
[SPEAKER_04]: percent of nitrogen that we add to fields
actually ends up in food that is consumed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are massive opportunities there
to improve the system-wide efficiencies in
[SPEAKER_04]: the food system about getting nutrient
recycling and avoiding emissions as
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients are added to soil and avoiding
emissions from producing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second game changer, I think,
is going to be coming from freeing up land
[SPEAKER_04]: through new technologies that are coming
out with novel foods that decouple food
[SPEAKER_04]: production from land.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, renewable energy is to
feed electrons to microbes to grow protein
[SPEAKER_04]: or artificial meats and these kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can free up land from food
production, then we can do a hell of a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to chime in and thank you for
bringing in the food system, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when people talk about greenhouse
gas emissions from food waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: they almost only ever think about
landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking about if something like 30
percent of food is wasted in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and similarly in many parts of the world,
that's a huge opportunity for increased
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think thinking about trying to not
just find beneficial uses for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those waste streams, but actually
eliminate the waste streams entirely and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase that efficiency, as Dominic said,
of nitrogen application to protein into
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual human diet is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also point to that overall
topic as an example where we do need
[SPEAKER_00]: systems thinking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are gadgets and widgets and
technologies that need to be improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there is huge opportunity to
improve the way we manage systems such as
[SPEAKER_00]: the food system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dominic, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Natalie, Johannes, anything to add or we
move on to the next one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll ask, I'll keep it going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flip side of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you think that we've already done
enough research on GHG, GHGs in
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture?
[SPEAKER_06]: What should we treat as settled issues so
that we can focus on the bigger picture
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of the emerging game changers
that you've identified?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe I'll try something here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that we're starting to converge
that soil carbon sequestration is a
[SPEAKER_03]: possibility and that it has a high
potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it can be achieved is a completely
different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what can be achieved and where the
trade-offs are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's on Dominic's mind that
trade-offs between N2O emissions and
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Peter also mentioned the trade-offs
between nitrogen sequestration and
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphorus sequestration and carbon
sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all important considerations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think we're slowly past questioning
the whole idea and getting into the weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: of actually making it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a really important step
that will then show some of the weak parts
[SPEAKER_03]: of actually doing it and monitoring it,
verifying it and monetizing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will probably need to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are countries that are actually
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a sort of lingering
vernacular that we can never measure soil
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I agree that probably modeling
and practice-based assessments of soil
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon changes is the more practical
approach, there are jurisdictions where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're actually measuring soil carbon
after the fact and doling out money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also that can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have not even really started
developing the tools in the digital
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture space that we could deploy to
make this less a soil sampling and dry
[SPEAKER_03]: combustion analysis approach, but a much
smarter approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're already down that road.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we don't need to question the
fundamental issues here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about getting it done and
developing the technology and the market
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanisms around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just ask one more question and then
we'll turn it over to the audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned market mechanisms and maybe
that underpins all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That if we don't have a carbon tax or a
nationally based cap and trade,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe we don't have the appropriate
incentives in place, but disregarding that
[SPEAKER_06]: from a public policy perspective and from
a private sector perspective, our current
[SPEAKER_06]: US and global priorities are actually
correct with respect to the real
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities for mitigating GHGs in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have it right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all about implementation at this
point, or what do we need to tell our
[SPEAKER_06]: friends in the political sphere in terms
of what should be priorities?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try chiming in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very difficult question to answer,
because there are so many different
[SPEAKER_04]: priorities from different policymakers and
different policies around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So giving a generic answer to that is
extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that at the moment,
there seems to be more prioritization of
[SPEAKER_04]: the simple incremental changes and really
no one taking a real stab at the simple
[SPEAKER_04]: systemic changes to the food system where
the big gains are to be had.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the short answer is no, I don't think
that the prioritization is currently
[SPEAKER_04]: right, because they're looking at
incremental improvements, small reductions
[SPEAKER_04]: in net greenhouse balances from
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that with really large
systemic changes to how food is made and
[SPEAKER_04]: also to what people eat, dietary change
can be a massive influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And tackling some of these bigger,
harder to tackle issues are actually where
[SPEAKER_04]: the big gains are to be had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are largely missing for the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the interest of time, I'm going to turn
it over to the floor now.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a question, just unmute and
ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: David, I think you had a question that
you're writing to me privately.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to pose that publicly?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a very interesting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I was getting confused.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, what Johannes said at the very
end, because when I listened to the other
[SPEAKER_05]: talks before, it seemed to me that the
conclusion would be that the whole idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: agriculture, storing soil organic matter
in agriculture is a very tiny part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: problem and probably fairly impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could easily be undone,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you said at the very end, though,
Johannes, you said, oh, we know what we
can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get going.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got from the earlier talks that the
money would just cause distortions and the
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers would game it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not that much anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're much, much bigger of
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my impression is we should just forget
this whole thing and go back to the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: health idea, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what Peter started with explaining
all the benefits of how we can manage
[SPEAKER_05]: organic matter and do good things in yield
and soils are fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to say we're part of the solution,
the GHG, maybe I missed the talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I misunderstood you, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was all following along.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, rule number one, just listen to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is part of the nuanced
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate it, because
probably there's maybe that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: impression that most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably should let Dominic and Peter
talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, these are all nuances around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm putting words in their mouths now
that they would probably not say we
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't put carbon into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we shouldn't use the climate mechanism
to help that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether the market mechanisms can be
developed, I mean, that's always the
[SPEAKER_03]: question, especially in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are other countries who have
already done it and shown that it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just a US problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say I have not seen anything
in Peter's and Dominic's talk that I
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't agree with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet I still agree with my points as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to get those together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's a distributed issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there are trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we probably always need to prioritize
soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the farmer will always prioritize
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we drive down soil health with
carbon sequestration, not only the farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: is not happy about it and will not do it,
but also in terms of many other systems
[SPEAKER_03]: such as biochar, it's probably better to
make energy from biomass than biochar if
[SPEAKER_03]: yields go down, because then it's a wash
in terms of the greenhouse gas balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't seen anything that is wrong
in the statements that were made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to get those all together in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll chime in on this for just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we do have areas of agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some extent, I think Dominic played
a very useful role of being a skeptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important, because there is so
much hot air around this topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in my mind, one of the challenges
is there are technical solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can say, if you do this practice in
this cropping system, you will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, you will increase yields,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are plenty of technical impacts
and improvements to current management
[SPEAKER_00]: that take a systems approach to an
agronomic system and say, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get better yields, we get better soil
health, and we get reduced greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to promote those systems and
make them happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a big question in my mind is,
how do you make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the simple idea in the US and
elsewhere of a payment to an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer for an individual practice on an
individual field, whether that's in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: or in Bangladesh, there are huge problems
with this concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tragedy of the commons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the challenge is managing the
land at a bigger scale than a single field
[SPEAKER_00]: or a portion of a field, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the issues in measuring soil
carbon or measuring benefits, if we could
[SPEAKER_00]: really get farmers in the Mississippi
River Basin to change their fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and change soil health practices
at a massive scale, it wouldn't be so hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure it if we weren't trying to
measure it on every field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be doing this from tall towers
and say, there's less CO2 emission.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in my mind, that's what we need
to be thinking about is, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: social and political and organizational
mechanisms by which we motivate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can do that at scale, then some of
these measurement issues go away and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gaming issues, et cetera,
go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I chime in on this one as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, David, for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping to stir up a little bit of
controversy and a discussion around this
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think we're in disagreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anything my talk said that
doing soil carbon is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has many benefits for water quality,
for cropping practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cover crops are useful in terms of farmers
are doing them anyway because they're good
[SPEAKER_04]: in their crop practices, not because
they're trying to store climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: No till is extremely common in dry land
because farmers want to do it because it
[SPEAKER_04]: helps them balance their water budget and
improve yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are many reasons for doing things
that store carbon soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm trying to inject some real
caution about, though, is having people
[SPEAKER_04]: overselling the idea that this is a silver
bullet, which is a lot of excitement
[SPEAKER_04]: around in the press, maybe not in academia
as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look outside in blogs and
papers and things like that, people see
[SPEAKER_04]: soil carbon as being the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that maybe gives people the thought
that they're going to maybe take the foot
[SPEAKER_04]: off the pedal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got climate change sorted.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to worry so much about the
other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, it can make at best an
incremental impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although when we see if we see numbers
saying it produces stores of carbon,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, in the first few years,
when you start a practice, it stores a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't persist.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reaches a new equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need to keep doing that practice
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after a decade or a couple of decades,
you're not getting any impact on climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is why we need to be thinking
about the long term total potential rather
[SPEAKER_04]: than the short term annual potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where I think we need to
manage people's expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because soil carbon is a bad thing,
but simply because we need to maintain the
[SPEAKER_04]: sense of urgency about the other things to
do with climate change, which are more
[SPEAKER_04]: impactful and more important in the
climate change realm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why the 4 per mil was so
intellectually dishonest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they said that every year you
could keep increasing at 4 per mil and
[SPEAKER_05]: keep on going and going and going and
going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I just don't like intellectual
dishonesty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they've pivoted quite a bit
from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to their website, it's all about
soil health, which is fine, and about
[SPEAKER_05]: yields, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, Dominic, you provoked me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to go to another meeting now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, David.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd like to entertain one more
question if Jenny is still online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is a question for Dominic and
Johannes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Dominic, you had that blue and
orange bar chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you show that basically biomass turned
into biochar is basically equivalent in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of its mitigation as bioenergy
displacing fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my question is, in helping someone
make, and in the context of Natalie
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about how important it is to keep
fossilized carbon fossilized, how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: give the relative value of, say,
the 100 year biochar sequestration versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1 million year bioenergy displacement?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're helping people come up with
a decision tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, this is a yes and question
because there are situations where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably more amenable to making biochar
versus bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just trying to understand how can I
think about how to frame it to
[SPEAKER_01]: plus bioenergy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when might you choose bioenergy,
even if it has a slightly less total
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigation, because it's keeping that
fossilized carbon with a thousand year
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan in the ground?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a paper a couple of years ago,
2016, I think, published in Energy
[SPEAKER_04]: Communications.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johannes is also a co-author on that,
looking at exactly this question.
[SPEAKER_04]: When might we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I compared, in fact, bioenergy biochar
and BEX in the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very complicated decision space
because there are so many factors that
[SPEAKER_04]: might drive you one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking at places where there's
very little opportunity to offset fossil
[SPEAKER_04]: fuels, for example, a country that has
already got or in the future already has a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of renewable energy, for example,
then that's going to push you towards
[SPEAKER_04]: favoring something that stores carbon
rather than offsets energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the whole space that it operates in is
quite complicated, but it's still a simple
[SPEAKER_04]: message from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it seemed to be is that in our
current world, where our energy systems
[SPEAKER_04]: are quite carbon intensive and carbon
prices are very low, we would probably
[SPEAKER_04]: prefer to make, most people would prefer
to go the more bioenergy route at the
[SPEAKER_04]: moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a transition, what's energy,
what's carbon prices go above about a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred dollars per ton of CO2,
sort of three to four hundred dollars per
[SPEAKER_04]: ton of carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point in location,
where the biochar is actually really
[SPEAKER_04]: helping improve your crop productivity,
because that's another of the dimensions,
[SPEAKER_04]: how does it impact your soil fertility?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in places where it's actually got a
useful benefit, particularly the tropics
[SPEAKER_04]: to soils, there we would introduce more
biochar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's another transition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people sometimes think that if you
want to store more carbon, if you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: improve the prospects for a technology,
you just need to throw more money at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually not true at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you increase the carbon price much
beyond that, other things that were
[SPEAKER_04]: uneconomic at those carbon prices become
the favored option, like bioenergy for
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon capture and storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at very high carbon prices,
in fact, you would even stop making
[SPEAKER_04]: biochar and direct all your efforts into
the tallest bar on that chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just one addition to that,
one can also look at that sort of from a
[SPEAKER_03]: geopolitical and dimension of very,
very high carbon price perspective and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, there are many, many ways to generate
energy, but there is practically only one
[SPEAKER_03]: viable way to make organic carbon out of
CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much as we can, keeping CO2 in an
organic form and creating value on Earth
[SPEAKER_03]: for humanity is a better way to do than
returning it as CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if we offset some other non-desirable
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of my more philosophical
geopolitical view on that, why I would,
[SPEAKER_03]: if possible, always favor keeping more
organic carbon on Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Dominic, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter, you also want to make a comment
about N in methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very briefly, I just want to say
because the popular press focuses so much
[SPEAKER_00]: on carbon, it's really important to
remember that in agriculture, greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gas emissions are entirely dominated by
nitrous oxide and methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's totally different from any
other sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the global scale, those are a small
part of the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're interested in agriculture
and greenhouse gas mitigation in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, you absolutely have to pay
attention to methane and nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because everything's
not always a win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, carbon and nitrogen are
stoichiometrically linked in soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about carbon and nitrogen
cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important, I think,
to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of focusing on solutions and
avoiding problems disguised as solutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are 10 minutes over time now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we should officially close.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd really like to thank the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fascinating discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping you consent to do a spring
follow-on because I suspect that we could
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about this for a full day and only
start to scratch the surface.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you so much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a delight to have you put the
panel together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks, everybody else, for attending.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
