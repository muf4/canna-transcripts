[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Danielle Eisman, and I work here at
Cornell in the public health program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of my normal day job,
I also lead a working group that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on manufactured housing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among many of those issues is the aspect
of energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what I'm here to talk to you
all a little bit about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for a little bit of context,
manufactured homes, nationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the largest source of
unsubsidized affordable housing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that we often forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also roughly, across the United
States, 22 million people that live in
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may be more familiar with the
term mobile homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, these homes, although they
are often built in a factory and
[SPEAKER_00]: transported, once they are installed and
put in place, they rarely ever move again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the term of mobile home is no longer
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now use the term manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to New York State Executive
Law 616, manufactured homes are defined as
[SPEAKER_00]: single-family dwellings, and they are
supposed to be allowed in residential
[SPEAKER_00]: districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state leaves it up to individual
municipalities in terms of the zoning for
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start digging down into some
of the zoning policies, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: outright ban manufactured homes in
municipal districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the language around it
prevents the installation of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although they are not always perceived
to be the most desirable form of
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable housing, the changes that we've
seen in the development of manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: homes has really allowed homes that are
built in factories and then transported to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a very affordable, energy-efficient,
environmentally friendly form of providing
[SPEAKER_00]: housing options for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know in New York State,
affordable housing is part of a crisis
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're experiencing nationally,
but also in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for a little bit more context,
in New York State, there's just under
[SPEAKER_00]: 200,000 manufactured homes that makes up
2.4% of the state's total housing stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: In rural areas, that percentage increases
up to over 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Tompkins County, we're at roughly
6% for the number of manufactured homes
[SPEAKER_00]: that make up the housing stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly a third of them are in
manufactured housing communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what we used to call mobile home parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York State has roughly 1,800 of
these in 48 of its 62 counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that Saratoga, Dutchess,
and Ulster counties have the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of manufactured housing
communities as well as manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, as I've encountered with many of
my students, very few people actually
[SPEAKER_00]: notice them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if anybody has driven past
a few of the communities just outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca, but they're frequently ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've come to learn through my
manufactured housing working group is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the people living in manufactured homes
are just filled with infinite need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy efficiency is one of our top
priorities in terms of the amount of needs
[SPEAKER_00]: that homes or people, residents living in
these homes need or have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to give you a sense of the energy
burden by housing type, other than a boat
[SPEAKER_00]: or RV van, mobile homes, manufactured
homes are among the highest in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And energy burden is referred to as,
or it means the percentage of income that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are spending on their energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that one unit or multi units
tend to be a little bit more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to energy usage and energy
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit more affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of folks prefer to have their
own space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are quite accustomed to living
in the city and sharing walls with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people still want their own
four walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be living in apartment
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so manufactured homes have been able
to offer that option to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, it comes with higher
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are spending a lot more of their
income on energy when they're living in a
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured home compared to a site built
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a sense of what that's like
here in Tompkins County, where I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing most of my work, we have roughly
11% of our housing stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for people living in manufactured
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17% of our existing housing stock in terms
of manufactured homes were built before
[SPEAKER_00]: 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because in 1976 HUD
started to change the rules in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy efficiency for manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have these 17% of those homes that
are from 1976 or before, it means they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in the worst shape in terms of
how efficient they are with energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also poorly insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they haven't been well maintained,
then a lot of those people are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable to extreme temperatures,
whether it's extreme cold or extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: An additional 26% of the manufactured
homes in Tompkins County were built before
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between 1976 and 1990, and again,
HUD increased the energy efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: standards for manufactured homes in 1995,
making slight improvements in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable and how energy efficient those
homes were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we still compare them to site built
homes or regular construction homes,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you saw in that previous graph,
there's still a lot of work to be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of ensuring people are safe and
comfortable and able to keep themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: alive when it's extremely cold out or
extremely hot out.
[SPEAKER_00]: An additional factor to consider is that
private investment companies are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy up manufactured housing
communities, which are perceived to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cash cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see these property management
investment companies buying up communities
[SPEAKER_00]: as an easy form of investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put very little investment back into
the community but they end up raising
[SPEAKER_00]: rents for residents living in those
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it often works is people either
rent the units as well as the land
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath it, or they rent the land and
the slab underneath the home and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: own the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can present some barriers if
you're trying to introduce energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency measures or programs for
residents in manufactured housing
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have seen in our own county,
we've seen it across other counties in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York state is that more and more of these
communities are bought up by these private
[SPEAKER_00]: investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently in our county, only 12 are still
privately owned by either a resident owner
[SPEAKER_00]: or a local owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is owned by a nonprofit and then the
rest are owned by private investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that people are usually
worse off in those types of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you a sense of energy costs,
and this data was, it's a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, I think the prices have changed
slightly in terms of the cost for using
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But online estimates suggest that a large
manufactured home would use roughly 670
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of propane per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if it's still at 325 gallon,
that's roughly a little over $2,000 a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen some projects locally,
and I'll talk about that next,
[SPEAKER_00]: that replacing this heating load with air
source heat pumps has reduced that
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly to just under $1,000 per
year for energy costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you get over 55% savings as well
as the reduction in carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions or carbon equivalents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, there's a lot of money
available to support these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts, such as installing heat pumps in
manufactured homes, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you recall, I talked about how some
of these homes, especially in our county,
[SPEAKER_00]: are older than when the energy efficiency
standards had changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1976, as well as 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of programs out there
to support the replacement of these older,
[SPEAKER_00]: less efficient homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State has its own replacement
funds available, but the application
[SPEAKER_00]: process is somewhat difficult to navigate,
especially for individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, the county or municipality
has to be able to apply for these funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a lot of effort put out there
for funding the improvement of
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a small sampling of the
programs that are available to help
[SPEAKER_00]: support and fund improved energy
efficiency projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the USDA Rural Development Section 502
direct loan program will provide loans for
[SPEAKER_00]: the replacement or the purchase of a new
energy efficient manufactured home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRA or Inflation Reduction Act will
give $5,000 credit to new energy efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also includes zero energy modular
homes, or ZEM, which are probably the most
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive in terms of energy efficiency
and low carbon emissions associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the use and the placement of those homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have HUD, which has been providing
community development block grants,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as loan guarantee programs,
choice neighborhood grants, home program,
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation and reinvestment initiatives,
or the price program.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that are focused on the replacement
or improvement or weatherization of
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the Department of Energy
Weatherization Assistance Program and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainable Energy for Consumers Award,
which, again, supports and allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: these improvements that you would apply to
a traditional site built home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can be applied to a manufactured home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the EPA Solar for All and the
Thriving Communities Funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, this is available via
Fordham University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody's familiar with Fordham
University and the flourishing communities
[SPEAKER_00]: grants, there's three levels of grant
funding available for different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: projects aimed at resilience and energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take a pretty wide scope with
what they're willing to fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip all of those funding
projects and get to what I'm supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: really focus on, which is some of the
local pilots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an organization that we have locally
called Ithaca Neighborhood Housing
[SPEAKER_00]: Services received just under $6 million
from the state last year to support
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure development for the Compass
Manufactured Housing Community,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is located in Chewensburg just
outside of Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sustainable Finger Lakes mobile home
pilot projects heat pump pilot program
[SPEAKER_00]: provided low cost heating and cooling
options for manufactured housing residents
[SPEAKER_00]: that qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program is wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, they aren't going to be
keeping that program going because they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't able to secure additional funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, they've been able to provide
energy audits and installations of
[SPEAKER_00]: air heat source pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember all the acronyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one example of that is where a woman
in the summertime, her bedroom was 108
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees at night throughout the day,
which is not healthy or safe for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this heat pump pilot
program, her bedroom is now very
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable no matter how hot it is
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the town of Dryden,
which is again nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been doing some door knocking
and handing out information on
[SPEAKER_00]: weatherization programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are partnering with Empower to try
and help those residents with improving
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy efficiency in their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my group, the Manufactured
Housing Working Group, we're just an
[SPEAKER_00]: informal group of local residents that are
really trying to make a difference in this
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be tabling tomorrow at the Energy
Expo as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will have a sample window insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a program based in Vermont that
provides these low cost window inserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it makes quite a
difference for the comfort inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when it was 29 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A room without the window insert was 47
degrees inside and without the window
[SPEAKER_00]: insert was 70 degrees inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another project we're trying to
develop is to build resilience hubs for
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured housing communities because
residents in these spaces often lose power
[SPEAKER_00]: first and for the longest amount of time,
which puts them at a high risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they're experiencing
extreme temperatures or other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme weather events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if anybody is interested in
joining our working group or attending one
[SPEAKER_00]: of our meetings, you can just email me and
you're welcome to sit in and hear ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: share your ideas, talk to us, contribute,
et cetera.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
Thank you.
