[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're around four inches to
about three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to want to cut it three and
a half to three inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're setting a deck, you don't want
to surround the top of the deck with
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give yourself a small gap for
air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we like to do is we'll set the
deck at its highest setting and slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: move them down in equal increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've still got enough room where we
could probably come down one more notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without surrounding the blade and the deck
with grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equally bring them down.
