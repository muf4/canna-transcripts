[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start us off with talking a
little bit about myself and where I come
[SPEAKER_00]: from and the people that I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up in a trailer at the edge of
the Tonto National Forest in New River,
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think desert wilderness like down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first day of school ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an enrolled member of the Owa Lakota
Nation in South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my family and I would spend a
lot of summers in the house that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: in my family for over 200 years and on
homelands for time immemorial before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom is from Ban Po, Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom's sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where we get the Po part of our names
and through a long and winding journey
[SPEAKER_00]: that I won't fully get into here that was
filled with a lot of adventure,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of being homeschooled and a
small stint of being homeless and living
[SPEAKER_00]: in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family and I moved to Hawaii and that's
where Ed mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my bachelor's degree at the
University of Hawaii at Hilo and after
[SPEAKER_00]: that I moved back to one of my homelands
to get my master's degree at South Dakota
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the first person in my family or my
mom's family to have gone to college and
[SPEAKER_00]: the first person in all of my family to
get any sort of graduate degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not telling you this because I
want you to feel sorry for me or think
[SPEAKER_00]: differently about me or my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that given my life and my
cultural background I feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical anomaly every time I enter
academic spaces and especially here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell and so I know I was never meant to
be here but I hope that today I can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit about what I've been able
to do in the past six years and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: this means to the people and places that I
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the past few years I have been
working on maize and maize is a fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: species to understand the genetic basis of
complex traits and so maize is an annual
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crossing species that's diploid with
10-chrome chromosomes and globally it's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown on around 200 million hectares and
it serves as a fantastic system to study
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic basis of complex traits to
learn about gene regulation and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: validate all of those findings within
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my project is split into three
different parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is on elucidating the patterns
of pleiotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is on the regulatory impact of
TEs and the last is on field testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: so for the first on pleiotropy it's
helpful to start off with some definitions
[SPEAKER_00]: because pleiotropy is still really
confusing even to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pleiotropy is a single locus that can
affect multiple different seemingly
[SPEAKER_00]: unrelated traits and there's a lot of
different ways that this pleiotropy can
[SPEAKER_00]: manifest itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is with biological or horizontal
pleiotropy that's where you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: single causal variant with a star that
then impacts two different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have mediated pleiotropy that
where one trait is then causal for another
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can have stereus pleiotropy
where regions of really strong LD make it
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to distinguish what causal variant is
leading to what traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in maize there are a few examples of
verified pleiotropy and these are things
[SPEAKER_00]: like Teosinte branch 1, one of the major
domestication genes that impacts lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: branching and fluorescence length and
branch length and there's also one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: major flowering time genes VGT1 that
impacts flowering time, leaf number and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking across larger sets of genes
and not only domestication or flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: genes the only real pleiotropy that has
able to be found is within a trait sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: the same developmental unit and so things
like tassel architecture and ear
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture like inflorescence traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some pleiotropy between
flowering and leaf traits where you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a certain number of leaves before
flowering initiates and then that life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle finishes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's further evidence of this with
sorghum and maize where the only
[SPEAKER_00]: pleiotropy that's really found is in very
few snips and they are typically between
[SPEAKER_00]: again things that are sharing the same
developmental unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a lot of the human genetic studies
they've been able to look at things like
[SPEAKER_00]: how pleiotropy is more associated with
more highly expressed genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed across more tissues along with
DNA accessibility and DNA conservation but
[SPEAKER_00]: in maize a lot of these things are largely
unknown and so in this project there are
[SPEAKER_00]: two main questions where what are the
actual patterns of pleiotropy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they kind of mimic some of these large
effect domestication or flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: loci or are they different in large
standing natural variation populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is can pleiotropy be
modeled and if so what kind of biological
[SPEAKER_00]: and noise terms actually explain the
amount of pleiotropy present?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to do this we collected
every single published phenotype within
[SPEAKER_00]: the maize NAM and 282 populations and this
came out to be over 120,000 different
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and they were for things like RNA
expression values across different
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues, metabolite data, and also field
traits so like the traditional plant
[SPEAKER_00]: height, kernel row number, and
inflorescence architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with these traits we performed GWAS
using our TASL and then for our pleiotropy
[SPEAKER_00]: metric we counted the number of unique
traits mapping to each interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this looked like for interval
A for example there's two shapes that map
[SPEAKER_00]: to it and so it's two unique traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For interval B it would just be one,
C is our least pleiotropic interval so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's zero, and then E is our most
pleiotropic interval with three unique
[SPEAKER_00]: traits mapping to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get a kind of null baseline of
what no pleiotropy would look like we
[SPEAKER_00]: permuted our traits anywhere from five to
ten times, ran GWAS again, and then got
[SPEAKER_00]: our null counts of what no pleiotropy
looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for all the plots that I'm going to
show you all the types of pleiotropy are
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't try to distinguish between any
one of these and so it's just a mixed bag
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize I could turn the captions off,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to prime you for the plot that I'm
going to show you this shows on the x-axis
[SPEAKER_00]: the log number observed over permuted
traits and the y-axis is the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing is is that anything
that falls along the dashed line means
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no pleiotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything to the left of the dashed line
means that there's noise and anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right means there's some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the NAM field traits around 1%
of intervals actually show evidence for
[SPEAKER_00]: pleiotropy and it controls around five
different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking across all the other populations
and trait types this number varies from
[SPEAKER_00]: one to 32% of intervals controlling
anywhere from five to 400 traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though this seems like a lot in
later slides I'll show you that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily due to noise terms imparted
through the GWAS process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that we know that there is
variability in pleiotropy we kind of will
[SPEAKER_00]: bring back a lot of the terms that have
been important within the human genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: models like gene expression, DNA
accessibility, DNA conservation and some
[SPEAKER_00]: noise terms that are imparted through GWAS
like the mean amount of LD within the
[SPEAKER_00]: interval we're looking at, the size of the
interval and then also the number of input
[SPEAKER_00]: GWAS SNPs that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put all these things together and
build a random forest model to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the most important variables in
explaining pleiotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows that primarily statistical
noise terms imparted through GWAS are the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again these are things like SNPs
for interval, the physical size and the
[SPEAKER_00]: average amount of LD of much lower
biological importance are things like
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence conservation, RNA expression or
protein expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very similar trend is shown across
all the other populations and trait types
[SPEAKER_00]: that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so altogether LD and noise terms
explain pleiotropy much better than any
[SPEAKER_00]: other biological feature or term and we
hypothesized that most descriptions of
[SPEAKER_00]: pleiotropic genes in the past are probably
really confounded by linkage because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a hard thing to break out of and there's a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the key takeaways from this project
were pleiotropy is not as common as we
[SPEAKER_00]: previously thought and the one to 32% of
pleiotropic intervals that we found can
[SPEAKER_00]: originate from sites with varying
chromatin accessibility, expression and
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most observed pleiotropy is noise and so
LD will really mess up any pleiotropy
[SPEAKER_00]: estimates that we get unless pleiotropy in
crop plants is highly constrained by
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the load of modest levels of
pleiotropy actually kind of makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would allow for selection to
more easily fine tune and adapt varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: to different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to think about if you had a
single gene that controlled 50 different
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, it's much harder to work with that
single gene as opposed to 50 genes
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling 50 different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though pleiotropy might have
had little genome wide impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact of trait curation and the GWAS
results themselves had a really large
[SPEAKER_00]: impact and I've been lucky to be a part of
numerous different papers that have used
[SPEAKER_00]: these traits and phenotypes to predict
traits with the RNA expression values or
[SPEAKER_00]: look at how they can be explained by
conserved non-coding regions upstream of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next project that I worked on was
looking at the impact of TEs on gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a study I was a major contributor
to in 2021 showed that around 34% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression variation in genes can be
explained by cis regulatory variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are variants that occur within
genes or right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the long standing questions has
been how much do transposable elements or
[SPEAKER_00]: TEs themselves contribute to this gene
expression variation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of makes sense in maze because
85% of the genome is made up of
[SPEAKER_00]: transposable elements or these repetitive
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a famous example of this is the bronze
one locus and maze where the different
[SPEAKER_00]: rows correspond to different maze inbred
lines and the yellow bars are
[SPEAKER_00]: retrotransposons and the orange or the red
triangles are DNA transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the maze genome is
absolutely littered with transposable
[SPEAKER_00]: elements throughout its inner genic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of TEs that contribute to gene
expression, teosinte branch one is another
[SPEAKER_00]: really famous example where a hopscotch
retrotransposon brings in an enhancer that
[SPEAKER_00]: then increases gene expression by around
two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads to the differences in plant
architecture between teosinte and maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing in an enhancer is just one
way in which a TE can potentially impact
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine with the bronze one
example, you could get a TE that inserts
[SPEAKER_00]: into an exon and leads to a loss of
function of the gene entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could be even more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the TE could introduce methylation to
the surrounding region and silence the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a large complex trait like
yields, TEs have been shown to impart
[SPEAKER_00]: really subtle effects on fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was another study I was a part of
that's now on bioarchive that showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals who had more TEs showed lower
grain yields in the maze NAMM hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making a number of assumptions on per
plant yields and planting density and the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of kernels per year, this came out
to losing around one to eight kernels per
[SPEAKER_00]: additional 14 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question kind of still remains
though, if the same small effects occur
[SPEAKER_00]: for smaller molecular phenotypes like gene
expression, like they do for yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key questions for this project
were, do TEs impact gene expression within
[SPEAKER_00]: the maze imbreds and hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, at what distances do these
effects occur at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What TE families cause the largest
effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, are there any known patterns
among those families?
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, how much expression variants do
these TEs actually explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they mimic some of the larger large
domestication loci or are they more subtle
[SPEAKER_00]: like yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do this, we use the high quality
maze NAMM genome sequences that were
[SPEAKER_00]: released a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also collected around 372 RNA
samples from both the maze imbred founder
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and then also hybrids between B73
and two other testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected RNA samples from across four
different tissues and quantified our
[SPEAKER_00]: expression counts with salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for our TE annotations,
we used the ones that were generated as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the NAMM genome project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were the EDTA TE annotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to actually model the effect of TEs
on expression, we chose to calculate the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of TE base pairs in non-overlapping
windows upstream of each gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this example, even though it
looks weird, the gene transcribes over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it looks funny, but I'll explain
the other parts of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll hopefully make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there's TEs upstream of
each gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that there are DNA
methylation plays a large role in whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not genes are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that unmethylated genes tend
to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we layer on unmethylated regions on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go window by window and count
the number of TE base pairs occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: within that window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of unmethylated regions
also occurring in that window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that for every window upstream
up to 15 kb away from genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do that for all the other
genes that are present in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we take all of those model
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we build a model that actually
asks, what is the effect of expression
[SPEAKER_00]: with TE base pairs in the number of
unmethylated regions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plot is showing the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing the gene that, again,
transcribes to the left and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: distances going away from that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yellow line shows the count of
unmethylated regions and the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate on the y-axis from the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see near the core promoter of
genes, TEs are sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near the core promoter, unmethylated
regions are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense because unmethylated
genes tend to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of TEs, we find a weakly negative
effect of TE base pairs when they insert
[SPEAKER_00]: within the core promoter, along with
another more weakly negative effect near
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual promoter of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of suggests that TEs are
imparting subtle negative effects when
[SPEAKER_00]: they insert into core regulatory regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense because they might be
potentially deleterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main problems, though,
with this model is that it's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: across all TE families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these families differ really
greatly by their insertion preferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: their actual sequence content,
and the also physical size of the TE
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an example just looking at
the differences of TE length on the y-axis
[SPEAKER_00]: between DNA transposons and
retrotransposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And retrotransposons or retros tend to be
much larger in general than DNA.
TEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looking at this plot in a
different way in my data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plot is looking at the proportion of
TE families that fall into four different
[SPEAKER_00]: size categories based on their cumulative
abundance across NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for very large TE families,
the ones on the bottom, there's only 48 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in my data set that are over 100
megabases in NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually make up like 50% of the
NAM genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an overwhelming majority of
really small TE families out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: still could potentially cause effects,
even though they don't contribute a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: total base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to see if there was an
effect between smaller TEs and really
[SPEAKER_00]: large TEs, I grouped them into these four
different size categories and ran the same
[SPEAKER_00]: model as before, seeing if there's an
impact of gene expression and TE base
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs given in each one of these small
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just looking at one DNA
transposon in the top 5% of TE families
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the largest effects on gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a DNA TE, a helitron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see a long distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variable effect of this one TE
family, a long distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the other small
families, they tend to cause the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: overall absolute effects on expression
versus much larger families, which are in
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so overall, yes, we do see an effect
with TE size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see an effect by distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're still looking into what a lot
of this means and whether or not it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighting the TE family insertion
preference into these different regions or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's actually something more
biological.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of our past models have shown
that distance is really important in
[SPEAKER_00]: determining if a TE has an effect or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to run a more simplified
model just with distance to see what that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took the number of base pairs
until the first insertion from a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this one would be the first mint
TE, the first blue TE family, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first orange one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do this for all the other TE
families and first insertions of that
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what our model looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just took expression against distance
for each family separately and did the
[SPEAKER_00]: same model for each family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plot is looking at the median
distance to that family by the partial
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted R squared on the y-axis of how
much variation it actually explains in
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around 1 kb away from genes tends to
have the largest effects on expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also explain that the color
of the points refers to the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that TE was present near.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the largest effect TEs tend to be
present in very few genes overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: TEs that are present in more than 1,000
genes don't tend to cause any large
[SPEAKER_00]: effects whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the top five families that
contribute to these effects tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: things like helitrons and other DNA TEs
along with one LCR retrotransposon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the future work in the next
coming months is going to be towards
[SPEAKER_00]: validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these effects and trying to
determine if there's any patterns in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that they insert near.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key takeaways from this project,
TEs in known regulatory regions decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tend to be near the core promoter
or actual promoter of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are known regions already that
are enriched for open chromatin or TF
[SPEAKER_00]: binding sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that TEs would impart
more of a negative effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is that small TE family.
[SPEAKER_00]: TE families tend to have the largest
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last is, yeah, TE families only
explain a fraction of the variance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cis-regulatory expression in the small
subset of genes that they actually insert
[SPEAKER_00]: near.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that the maize genome
might be using selection to restrict large
[SPEAKER_00]: effect TE insertions in favor of more
small effect ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of my work until this point
has shown that quantitative traits are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly polygenic and that any candidate
loci that we find will have incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: small effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is dictated by Alan
Orr's work and along with Fisher's
[SPEAKER_00]: geometric model that says as a population
gets closer to its fitness optimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as maize, the smaller those effects
will actually be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this makes sense because maize has
undergone domestication already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any trait that we're looking at now
will have really small effects overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for yields, the most complex and
quantitative of all traits, we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: expect anything different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this segues into my last project on
yield testing that was published in Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sparked by a lot of papers that
have been published over the last 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: that say that they can increase yields by
anywhere from 8% to 68% through a single
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the main problems is that these
results never translate into real yield
[SPEAKER_00]: gains on farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after reading a lot of these papers
and running a structured review of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that they have a lot of common
problems among them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these problems are things like a
misunderstanding of what yield actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: and how yield components contribute to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also has to do a lot with measuring
single plant yield versus plot yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is not matching on-farm conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks are not testing in a
lead germplasm and having confounding edge
[SPEAKER_00]: and density effects that lead to
misleading yield estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also questions of scale with hand
harvesting versus mechanically harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also insufficient environmental
and plot replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a good number of greenhouse
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this typically isn't a problem if
you're trying to do like a proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: concept experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're saying four plants grown
in the greenhouse are going to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: face of agriculture forever, it starts to
become a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also very little plot or
environment replication and testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield effects in only a second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of testing genes that
might have already been fixed within
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs and also looking at
yield effects in alleles that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: segregating within breeding populations
for the past few decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often when you read really closely
within these papers, you find that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot of trade-offs with other yield
components in those yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to think about when you bring
those particular yield alleles to
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last is lack of controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of folks don't have empty
vector controls or don't back-cross their
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties into non-transformed varieties
or elite varieties to kind of clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those background epigenetic
effects that can occur during the
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I talk about the latter two within
my paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read about those there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am just going to dive a little bit
deeper into the first three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a misunderstanding of yield and
yield components, yield is typically the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of the dry grain or the dry matter
content of the storage organs harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: per unit area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what a lot of these papers tend to
do is measure differences, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in grain lengths for example, between a
wild type and a mutant, and say that that
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in like a quarter of a millimeter
of grain length is then going to translate
[SPEAKER_00]: into plot-wide yield later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same goes for changes in grain length
or differences in grain fill between a
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type and a mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of my favorites is measuring
biomass changes in Arabidopsis and saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that that will then translate into crop
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so only 40% or that's a lot of them of
the studies in my review measured yields
[SPEAKER_00]: within single plants or measured yields
components and passed that off as their
[SPEAKER_00]: yield increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main problems with this though
is that increases in individual yield
[SPEAKER_00]: components or single plant yields won't
necessarily scale, especially it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: imply that yield per area will increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is beautifully exemplified in a
lot of Donald Dubik's work, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: year of hybrid introduction and the
pioneer mills breeding program from
[SPEAKER_00]: starting in the 1930s up to the 2010s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows that when a variety is
planted at incredibly low density,
[SPEAKER_00]: older hybrids tend to yield just as much
as newer hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you increase the density,
older hybrids are incredibly out-competed
[SPEAKER_00]: by newer hybrids in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this implies that single plant yield
hasn't really changed over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: however the yield per unit area has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been a selection target in
maize breeding programs over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of scarily, only 16% of the
studies in my review actually planted at
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially relevant densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite typically they're at incredible low
densities and that will skew yield
[SPEAKER_00]: estimates in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up next is insufficient environment and
plot replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an example from wheat,
looking at the yield within a plot
[SPEAKER_00]: starting from the center and going out to
the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see as you go out further to
the edge, those yield estimates will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase because those plants along the
edge have more access to light and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and all those good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll yield more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what folks do is only measure
the stuff on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something else that can impact just
plot yield in general is competition
[SPEAKER_00]: between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of studies don't tend to
actually have border rows or put really
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive genotypes next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will skew a lot of these
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also small plots in terms of the
physical size of the plots and the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of individuals that can lead to unreliable
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whopping 92% of the studies had
experimental designs that would amplify
[SPEAKER_00]: edge effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to keep an eye out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, very few studies actually
measured yields within the center rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, in a four row plot,
discarding the outer two rows and only
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some last quick stats on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of plants per plot, it varied
from anywhere from four plants to 900.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 900 is approaching the scale of a
small scale yield trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, around 40% of the studies
measured less than 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of plot replication, 46% of them
measured in less than three plots overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, this was only in a single
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of multiple year testing,
only 63% of them tested in less than three
[SPEAKER_00]: years of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very little validation often goes into
some of these large high impact papers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of limited testing in elite
germplasm, this is an example from tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at tobacco yields in a bunch of
commercial tobacco hybrids and Petit
[SPEAKER_00]: Havana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Petit Havana has been used in a lot of
studies because it can be transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also been used for a lot of yield
estimates and some high impact papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing is is that Petit
Havana yields 1,600% less than a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial competitive counterpart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 46% of the studies did not test in
elite germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the favorite analogies that I've
heard for testing in elite germplasm is
[SPEAKER_00]: like changing a single part in a Model T
versus a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a Model T is not elite or
competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any improvement that you make to it
will seem great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's limited in its frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's designed by how fast it can go
given that improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the main arguments that I've
gotten is that they're available to
[SPEAKER_00]: academics.
[SPEAKER_00]: To actually test their transformable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why folks use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is as opposed to something like a
Ferrari that's elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commercially competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any improvement that you make to it
will already add to a optimized engine in
[SPEAKER_00]: design.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these, typically they're only
available to folks within industry or
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders themselves given patent variety
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outside of plant breeding,
most folks don't know that ex patent
[SPEAKER_00]: variety protection protected lines exist
for them to test and actually validate
[SPEAKER_00]: effects in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would kind of refer to these as kind
of like Guy Fieri's car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diners, dive-ins, and drives, they are
fairly competitive lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any improvements that you make in
yields can be realistically tested in
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat quality germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part is that they are
available to academics to test in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing all of these things together,
I grouped a lot of the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about into three general
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are things like controlling
for moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they avoid edge effects in their
experimental design?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they replicate their experiments?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did they test an elite germplasm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the study did that thing correctly,
I gave it a green box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they didn't do it well, I gave it a
black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was unclear, if that information
wasn't provided, I gave it a different
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking across studies,
no one thing consistently goes wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: within them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these studies shows a variable
experimental design and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really important to check for
a number of different things when
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating the quality of these
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to note that no single
yield gene has ever been commercialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not from a lack of trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is as far as we can tell in the
public data, even though two genes have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through regulatory steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about one of them in the
next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one of my favorite papers
within this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Carl Simmons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks at a two decade long industry
breeding program where they tested 1,600
[SPEAKER_00]: genes from 47 different species at scale
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at things for growth in
yields, like water use efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen use efficiency, all different
kinds of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that of these 1,600 genes,
only eight of them significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rest were either non-significant
in gray or significantly drug down yields
[SPEAKER_00]: in the environments that they were tested
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only gene that has shown a lot of
evidence and has gone through regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: approval has been ZMM28.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a May's domestication
transcription factor that across most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the environments and conditions it was
tested in increases yields by around 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, this is extraordinary because you
could statistically actually test for a 2%
[SPEAKER_00]: yield gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one or the second thing is that
this gene actually exists, which feels
[SPEAKER_00]: very rare, very modest but rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so given that a lot of these single
yield genes consistently get published in
[SPEAKER_00]: high impact journals, I found it necessary
to write more of a policy piece to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that yield testing is more robust going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, I assembled a team of
global domain experts from across the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields of quantitative genetics,
plant breeding, molecular biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and population genetics to write this
perspective piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say right now that all of these
yield testing criteria aren't novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all written about in Fisher's 1935
Design of Experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're published in Kieselbach's PhD
dissertation from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska-Lincoln in 1917.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are back in the day when
planters used to be drug behind horses and
[SPEAKER_00]: they could still make plots well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the criteria that we came up with
were things like using standard
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is measuring plot yield versus
single plant yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is testing for genotype by
environment by management effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's matching on-farm conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is thinking about plant
competition and density and edge effects
[SPEAKER_00]: as you're creating your experimental
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also following on-farm practices
for planting and harvesting and fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also prioritizing genes that plant
breeding may have missed or checking to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that they're not already fixed within
commercial breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using appropriate controls and elite
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so testing those empty vector controls
and wild types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also developing collaborations
because no one person knows how to do all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to kind of conclude all of these
different projects in a mixed bag of a
[SPEAKER_00]: slide, anywhere from 1% to 32% of
intervals show some sort of pleiotropy in
[SPEAKER_00]: maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of this is noise imparted through
the GWAS process.
[SPEAKER_00]: For TEs, we found that primarily small TEs
that insert into known regulatory regions
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to the largest negative effects on
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for yields, we redeveloped a set of
yield testing standards to robustly test
[SPEAKER_00]: for effects in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this will help researchers
and reviewers in the future critically
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze this body of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple key lessons that I learned
through my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I split this off into more scientific and
personal ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first is I can never escape the
constraints of Fisher and Orr.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two people that are always there
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always bring me small effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lab motto has been failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fail fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would build on that and say building
and nurturing the strength of fail fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then trusting yourself in that process
is really helpful to my growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: development as a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I've used social media a lot,
especially Twitter, as a platform for
[SPEAKER_00]: positive change within our scientific
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: To one, call for more rigor within yield
testing studies that led to the Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also serving as probably some
grad students reviewer number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And correcting all of their yields things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is calling for more
cultural change within our scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: societies that will hopefully end up
leading to better environments for our
[SPEAKER_00]: black, brown, and indigenous scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of personal things, I found that
community is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about mine in the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the folks that help keep you sane
throughout this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last is you yourself are the most
important project that you will ever work
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: During your time at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no scientific project is worth your
mental or physical well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're all here to develop and to
learn and to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as you yourself are doing
better than you yourself yesterday,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of finding community,
I've been really lucky to be a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Synapsis and the Indigenous Grad Student
Association over the past few years that
[SPEAKER_00]: have provided a lot of great friendships
and sounding boards for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to say thank you to my
family for supporting me this entire time
[SPEAKER_00]: and through this very stressful process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very thankful for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also thankful to a lot of the mentors
that have helped me along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the folks that taught me
genetics and statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks that have helped me through a lot of
different projects and encouraged me to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into some of my first research
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as folks that have helped me move
on to the next stage of my career and find
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with my mom who's filming all of
this from the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's supporting me this whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to say thanks to the mentors
that are no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My master's thesis advisor, Don Ogier,
passed away in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always said that for this talk,
he'd drive here and sit in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why there is a seat with a
blanket reserved for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, I'd like to thank
the Buckley Lab for all of their help
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout various projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: My committee, Cedric and Wojtek,
along with the American Indian and
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous Studies Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not for them, I wouldn't have written
my last three papers or dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so very thankful for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been funded over the past few
years by a NIFA predoctoral fellowship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question and a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if you're finding that playa
tropi plays a smaller role than folks
[SPEAKER_02]: previously thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's related to the fact that maybe we can
now dissect phenotypes better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we understand what a phenotype is and
what are distinct phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with
the type of association models that people
[SPEAKER_00]: were using before, because a lot of playa
tropi was called the QTL studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just makes it seem like a whole
chromosome arm is significant as opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to GWAS that gives you a likely list of
candidates that are causal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My comment is that actually it is also a
kind of form of a question that the last
[SPEAKER_02]: bit that you talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder to what degree you think that
these other extending of validity of
[SPEAKER_02]: results for scientific papers is driven by
people who write them or the editors of
[SPEAKER_02]: journals that push for particularly highly
visible papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was to place a blame, my suggestion
would be 80% editors, 80% people who
[SPEAKER_02]: submit to pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what your thought is,
since you've actually very carefully read
[SPEAKER_02]: all those papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the responsibility goes
to editors because they are responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for finding the correct peer reviewers for
these kinds of articles that typically
[SPEAKER_00]: these yield studies tend to only be like a
couple of sentences or a table in the
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementary info.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, they typically try to find
reviewers that can cover the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper versus a couple sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a lot of the reason why
these things can get published eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are actually highly cited and
yeah, well used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Superb talk, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a related question to Voytex about
publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, PlantGenX as a whole has just
churned out massive volumes of GWAS
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those hits don't get used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always felt like a part of that
is that a GWAS fits in a dissertation and
[SPEAKER_01]: a variety doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 years to make a variety, three years,
you know, field trial plus analysis and
[SPEAKER_01]: writing for a GWAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with QDL mapping before it and test
out five GS models after it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought, as somebody who's
thought like really heavily and looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: these and looked at 25 of them,
very intent and thought about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, have you, do you have thoughts on
one, if you feel like that statement I
[SPEAKER_01]: just made is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two, if you have thoughts about
how in a field where start to finish,
[SPEAKER_01]: the process takes 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to stay for that for PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: How we can mitigate that and start having
more things that are relevant to variety
[SPEAKER_01]: development, but that shift within a five,
six year time span.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a little hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solve the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the second version of our GWAS
paper, like we talk about ways in which to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe your results in a way that's not
like this gene will change the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and increase yield by like
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more modest in that like future or
additional testing is needed before it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be used in the field or, you know,
talking about it differently with industry
[SPEAKER_00]: partners, for example, who have the better
abilities at scaling this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that way, you still get a paper
that's still important and show the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cycle of academia is really short
and dependent on a grad student or a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to say where the
responsibility lies in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: larger projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say right about the results a
little bit differently and go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark says he's going to use this paper in
his class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to future grad students.
[SPEAKER_04]: It already is being used at a number of
universities like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions on the chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the genes that are essentially
having no relationship to yield,
[SPEAKER_06]: are they, and this might be more of a
speculative question, but are they genes
[SPEAKER_06]: that are not actually scaling up and have
no relationship to yield?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think that they are genes that
have something that is relevant,
[SPEAKER_06]: but only to that scale down?
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, maybe that field did not
have enough water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's actually a drought related
gene that actually increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're typically sometimes only
good in some of those smaller experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a number of studies from
industry looking at how variable these
[SPEAKER_00]: single gene effects are by environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they show just gigantic G by E
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for any one of these genes to
actually go through the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: process, it costs hundreds of millions of
dollars in order to do all the safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the yield trials in different
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever an industry company wants
to commercialize one of these genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to make sure that it's stable
across the majority of environments that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why ZMM28 is one of those
rare exceptions of they're not willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay $200 million for one environment,
one condition kind of yield gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to something that will work
well across a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I make a comment that's supposed to
ask any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say that there's an
uncommon amount of wisdom in the talk that
[SPEAKER_03]: you just gave, as opposed to results and
cool analyses or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different order of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my comment is one that I want
everybody to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little scared by saying this,
but there are two things that you said
[SPEAKER_03]: that are really strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that you said was I was never
meant to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that you said was
cultural change is a really important
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that our
audience is hearing that and thank you.
Thanks, Jelica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of interested about your take on
what could be the evolutionary role of
[SPEAKER_05]: light entropy and transposable elements,
in your opinion, regarding more of the
[SPEAKER_05]: backseat driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they might lead to some of the
larger adaptive changes, especially TEs
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, because some of these effects
have led to some of the really large
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication genes, for example,
or radical changes in gene expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially under stressful conditions like
salt or drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of TEs could get activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there is a really large
impact, even though right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: for things like yields, it doesn't seem
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as for pleiotropy, I still think it
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a common limitation to what we're
doing is that GWAS can only look for
[SPEAKER_00]: pleiotropy in common variants,
because you need segregating alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still have pleiotropy at fixed
loci, like TB1, because you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more safety and fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't lose critical functions if that
gene gets lost or the allele frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, and it's no longer prevalent in
the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it still has some effect,
but not massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we don't need bonus slides.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your thoughts on candidate gene
identification could be refined for
[SPEAKER_00]: relevance to elite germplasm and breeding
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often we rely on insights from GWAS and
very diverse association panels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which typically don't have as much applied
relevance in structured breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes going to other species and
finding genes that haven't already been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested for a long time within the same
species can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of even the yield genes that have
been published before do have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: promise, because sometimes they're
introduced from different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could have novel effects that
haven't been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there is a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that answers your question.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
