[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting when we compare notes,
some of the things that Heather has said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say again, and the reason
being is what we both found.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are critical steps in success with
these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we repeat them, because that's
what we've been finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, basically, winter cover crops are
really winter forage is basically a cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop on steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the benefits and then some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as she said, you put some
management into growing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put some effort in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really comes back to benefit you in
multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the soil nutrient benefits and
you get a return on your checkbook that
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: With winter forages, we're increasing our
yield per acre 25 to 35 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting six to 10 tons of very high
quality feed early.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had the drought in 16,
a lot of people put it in because they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed feed early in the next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gave them the earliest feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces forage for the high and fresh
cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all make heifer feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all make low cow feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't always make that cream puff
stuff for the high cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for the high cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a number of farmers who have
told me they grow it specifically to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer, because when the heat turns
on and the cows slump, they put that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no slump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cows keep milking right on through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dick Grant up at Miner Institute said
that's because of the very high NDFD
[SPEAKER_00]: digestibility of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can digest that fiber without
producing a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they keep on milking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys grow it specifically for the high
cows and they get all the benefits of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: While doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put nitrogen on and sulfur,
you need sulfur, you're going to get crude
[SPEAKER_00]: protein equal or beating a lot of the
legumes, 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have an energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking that flag leaf stage, you'll have
an energy level with a net energy of
[SPEAKER_00]: lactation equaling what a lot of corn
silages have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the TTNDFD,
the total track of NDF digestibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: average corn silage or average alfalfa is
42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff is 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stuff is 66.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys have started growing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now come back and they grow it again and
again and again because of the milk you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the economics on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economics are driven a lot by yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs between seven tenths of a ton per
acre to two tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two tons per acre is worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a shot of nitrogen in there and
one ton dry matter reduction in the corn
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll explain why that occurs in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may disappear, especially based on
work that Heather has been doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: these short season corn varieties that
really crank out the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look at her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see short season varieties we
can grow that really push the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always need a yield hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimum planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, where I am, I'm just south of
Auburn in New York, 10 days to two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the 500 pound gorilla in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: For yield, you need to get it in the
ground as she said, 10 days to two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before your wheat planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wheat planting date is September 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days before that, I need to have this
in the ground September 5th or September
[SPEAKER_00]: 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to get the corn off then to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By not planting it early, by planting it
in October, because that's when we put
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there goes 20% of our yield right
off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you need those early heat units to
drive the tillering.
[SPEAKER_00]: As she said, you get nine tillers instead
of one or two tillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were going to plant late and add
more seed as seed guys like to sell you to
[SPEAKER_00]: do, you're going to have to put 450 pounds
of seed out there to get the same yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get it in on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Bill Cox's work found that there was
three quarters of a ton of silage loss for
[SPEAKER_00]: every five day shorter season corn on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Heather and Joe Lawrence's work,
where they can see that the shorter season
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties can crank out the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one this year, an 80 to day variety
gave me 30 tons to the acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to take this as an
assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go from 105 day to an 85 day,
so we can get our triticale planted sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: or our rye planted sooner, we're going to
give up a ton of dry matter, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: about 3,780 pounds of milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're replacing it with two to four tons
of dry matter of winter forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now gaining 8,000 to 16,000
pounds of milk per acre for 3,700 we gave
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and look at her short season corn
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: By shortening up the corn, you're not
going to be losing yield if you double
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important part is, is we may not
even lose yield with some of these shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: season varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more graphic example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did assume that three ton yield,
this is what it looks like if we put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: single long season, 20 ton to the acre
versus 17 with a double crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you put on a minimum double
crop or an optimum double crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can explain some of those pieces why
it has to do somewhat with their climate
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is, is now we are
getting more yield than with a full season
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not out there in November
chopping corn silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out there in November chopping
corn silage, you are packing the snot out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting long term yield
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your corn off when the ground is dry,
get your triticale in, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take off and keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we remove the residue, it makes it
easier to plant the next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a problem with some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is called allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I had brought up with
Sarah who talked just before lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allelopathy is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will inhibit grass crops growing next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn, sorghum, teff can be inhibited by
having winter grain residue there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get around it by using strip till.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another picture of what we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's a clearing coulter that has
little like knives on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it scrapes the top half inch or inch
of dirt away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes that allelopathy from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant it into clean ground and it pops
up out of the ground and grows with no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do that, you are going to be
taking somewhat of a yield loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a four ton yield loss at Minor
Institute where they planted right into
[SPEAKER_00]: rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of that was allelopathy just
inhibiting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scrape that aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your no-till planter,
plant right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to allow air and water to
move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For clay soils, this is huge because clay
soils seal over like this countertop on
[SPEAKER_00]: the first rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air and water can't go in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it rains, it all washes off and takes
the soil with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The virgins clays are perfect for that
kind of stuff, for sealing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are planting into this,
all those stems have a root going down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground, allows air and water in
and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have allelopathy, it's sort of like
getting lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: God gave you lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You make lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps weeds from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lancequarters, pigweed, ragweed,
all those keeps from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the corn crop from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the sorghum crop from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't affect legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, well, duh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, people don't like to put in
legumes very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like to rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they only get a half a crop
seeding year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second year, you get full year
and then yield and then yield start to
[SPEAKER_00]: come off over time afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see down and take a half
a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow winter forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take off two to four tons of dry
matter, come back in and no-till your
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa into it, getting one cutting of
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total yield that year is equal to your
full years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never take a yield loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now get a full yield on that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: An added benefit on that is, first of all,
the wind stays up and off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys found that this last year when
it was really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They planted their alfalfa, no-till,
and the triticale stubble, and it still
[SPEAKER_00]: grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kept that drying wind off of those
little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could get established.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took off and grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works with alfalfa, red clover,
and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-tilling it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces seeding risk, as I just pointed
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases seeding year yield,
which I just mentioned a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your total yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stops erosion loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a farmer call me up here about in
July or August, and he said, I put in 500,
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 acres of alfalfa this year,
plowed it all up, smoothed it all up,
[SPEAKER_00]: planted alfalfa on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 150 acres of triticale I mowed it
off, and I no-tilled alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we had a lot of gully washers,
downpours.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had it in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got hammered.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I've got 500 to 600 acres of
gullies, rocks, and no seeding because the
[SPEAKER_00]: field's washed out, and I have 150 acres
of cream puff alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: His question to me was, does it justify
the cost of a new no-till drill?
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him the names of a couple people to
talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never talked to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he just wanted a reality check.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went out and bought the no-till drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing all his leggings this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other benefit that happens on big
farms that inhibits weeds that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, it moves the workload.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first nice day in April, you're a week
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second nice day in April, you're two weeks
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that the way the workload usually
goes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get seedings in,
get groundwork up, stones planted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and spread manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that groundwork up so you can plant
corn all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take all the seedings and we move them
right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come springtime, you spread your manure,
you plant your corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in, harvest your triticale or rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get your grass fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triticale comes off just before the cool
season grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your triticale, you take your
cool season grasses, then go to your
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa grass mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish up with good alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's beginning of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back in that field, spray it,
with a quarter roundup or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a half quarter roundup and a
high gallonage of water, 17, 18 gallons a
[SPEAKER_00]: acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hose it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of little shoots and plants
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wipe them out, come back in with your
no-till planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field had no post-mergent herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will grow very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a huge sleeper in winter
forages that few people have realized
[SPEAKER_00]: works, and it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now managing this for forage, you have two
managements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heather touched on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a fall nitrogen management and
you have a spring nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two very different pieces,
but they are interrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah's talk just before lunch here today
was right in the ballroom, was right on
[SPEAKER_00]: target with terms of tying up nitrogen
from the fall, keeping it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biomass that you have is the most
important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is driven by planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen stored is driven by biomass times
the planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: 62 pounds of nitrogen we picked up after a
corn crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we planted it late, we picked up four
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the 60 pounds go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the water supply or denitrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are losses to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a pollutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we plant this on time, we're going to
pick up 60 pounds of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taken this a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits that you get from cover crops
or winter forage accrue according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is planted September 9th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is planted October 6th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be not needing any
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will need a herbicide because there
will be weeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tying up the nitrogen,
adding organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are going deeper, adding soil
structure, soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And producing those tillers Heather had
talked about that give you the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this because you get it in on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On time is very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dr. Ketterings and myself have
both come up with a similar graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our data, our research is each,
which is as your biomass goes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pounds of nitrogen stored goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did find out too that mine didn't
have a higher nitrogen, didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher line with manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the exact same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: No difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I just figured out
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did is we said, all right,
if this will tie up nitrogen, what if I
[SPEAKER_00]: put some manure on in the fall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my previous work, any time I
put nitrogen on in the fall, I got a yield
[SPEAKER_00]: increase across all nitrogen levels the
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, well, I don't want to buy
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all got manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to unload.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we put some on the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came in and we put 4,000 gallons on,
incorporated right away, and planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came in in October, put 4,000 on,
incorporated, and planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of November, we had 123,000
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 13 pounds of nitrogen stored in
the above ground material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the October one, we had four pounds of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was still in the soil,
and much of that was gone by spring if it
[SPEAKER_00]: had converted over to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have another piece going on here
where we're looking at putting that manure
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Iowa right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get a truck to haul it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to try coming in end of
November and injecting right into the sod
[SPEAKER_00]: of winter forage manure so we don't need
nitrogen in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put it in late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ammonia form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stay there till spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it warms up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to convert to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as it warms up, the winter
forage is already growing, and it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to suck it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, I said 75 pounds of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a higher tons of dry matter to
break even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we can drop that so we don't
need anything in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am using instinct with it,
but we don't know whether it pays or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My problem is the research is on a farm
that Cornell is selling tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a sweet talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever buys it to let me finish my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on tender hooks until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the answer tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put manure on in the fall,
the following spring, we got 14% higher
[SPEAKER_00]: yield where we had put it on versus not
putting manure on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we doing in October?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 33% higher yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, there is still a significant
portion of that nitrogen is lost because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have enough biomass to tie it up
and store it in the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the critical piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an environmentally sound program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I have real reservations on in terms
of polluting the water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dressing it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend top dressing it in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done a good job planting this in
the fall, this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spread manure on that, it's going to
get into the crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have one farm, they refuse to admit
anything, but I understand why,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a complete embarrassment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put manure on, chop the stuff off,
put it in the silo.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they started to feed the bunk out,
they hit it with the loader and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: pile slid down in a slimy maggot filled
mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to feed that to the cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They insisted on it, screwed the cows up
royally, making things even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend putting manure on the
top of any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some possibilities for injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on that as I go right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll be able to continue the
research on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're going to probably do it just
before Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface application problem comes back to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it mixed into those crowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was taken last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my winter forage looks like
going into the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just putting it on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get into the crowns and it's
going to be there in spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you could get into real
troubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're looking at an injector
that will slice through, put it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground so we don't have the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that works, we could theoretically come
in in March when the ground has maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of frost left in it and put
that in then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way out on a limb on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern would be we're expecting a lot
of rain this winter, 200% of normal
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supposed to be warmer than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if rain is leaching through this and
the ground is frozen, then it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: running off in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some real hesitancy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you where we're going
with the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, as Heather said before, stage of
growth is a bigger effect than the species
[SPEAKER_00]: of grain shows them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is stage eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: At stage eight, it's not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf is still rolled up in the stem
here, coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting full yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is stage nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last leaf is out and the head is in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we hit for high quality
winter forage, whether it's rye,
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat, or barley, or triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we hit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I had stage eight on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had stage nine on a Tuesday,
from Thursday to Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that time frame, we had a 35% yield
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could give you something to put on to
get a 35% yield increase, you jump on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in this case, you built the factory,
let it produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it produce until you get to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is stage 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's boot stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were at 12,000 pounds of milk per
cow, that was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're at 30,000 pounds of milk per
cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we need to be, is at stage
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, a couple of pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, Jeff's work showed that triticale,
the red line here, loses quality at a
[SPEAKER_00]: slower rate than wheat or rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece is, what is the
temperature of the year you're doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010, it was a normal to warm spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it went down, here's either this one or
this one is flag leaf stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is going down as time went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is digestibility KD rate
per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, we were at flag leaf stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually boot stage year,
flag leaf, boot, and headed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still real high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, two hours north of us, they had
three feet of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was down to freezing or just above
freezing that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's that cold, you don't have to
rush quite as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a bigger window to get things
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, usually when it's cold like
that, it's also damp and rainy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't always get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it rains for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff is all headed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, there's a lot of farms
feed straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could chop this stuff as head straw
and you put it in your TMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is, at late food to early milk
stage, it's intermediate on protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate on energy, digestibility will not
inhibit intake for good heifer growth
[SPEAKER_00]: without the heifers getting fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes an excellent heifer feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one farm that grows this for their
dry cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put any manure on that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow it for dry cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow red clover and triticale the
middle of June, I'm pulling off 21 tons to
[SPEAKER_00]: the acre of 35% dry matter material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go just triticale, I pulled off 16,
almost 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer says he gets consistently 18
tons to the acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would not use red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use medium red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover heads out too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it deteriorates real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium red keeps right on growing and can
produce a lot more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the dry matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is mowed right to a windrow and
go ahead and chop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're doing it stage nine and
you're doing it for the milk cows,
[SPEAKER_00]: do not mow it to a narrow windrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use wide swath same day
haylage to get that quality in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sugar runs 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year it ran 26%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys I was doing the work with said,
we can't use your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to believe us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 26% sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunny days, cold nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll produce the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one farmer said he started
worrying about the cows because when they
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled up with a wagon, the mixer wagon
with this stuff in it, he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the cows jump up and come running over
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, well, as long as they're doing
that, I wouldn't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to start rolling it and smoking
it out back of the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: High yields, 6 to 14 tons to the acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to three times what alfalfa will
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means your management for
harvesting stuff has to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the guy was mowing it, thought he was
doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of cutter bar width.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be more than 80% of cutter bar
width.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is we stopped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened up the shields in the front of
the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he was driving on it, but now we are
at 80% of cutter bar width.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second piece is mowing with these
shields down, the lawyer shields down
[SPEAKER_00]: versus up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we mow when it down, what happens is
it comes up, it hits it and drops it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lump and lumps don't dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Curtis Martin in Savannah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was measuring every two feet was a pile
and the piles don't dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He opened it up so it flows right through
and out the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads it uniformly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to dry a whole lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the lumps all the way up through
and down and over, back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we opened up the back of the
machine and you can see the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lays it out loose, fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to let air through it and let
it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you do, as one farmer said,
if I grow this right and I'm pulling off
[SPEAKER_00]: three and a half tons of dry matter,
it goes out the back of the machine and it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes splat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dries on the outer three quarters of an
inch and the rest sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours after mowing, we recommend you
come in with a tether and ted it,
[SPEAKER_00]: lift and spread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to watch your forward speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you make tether lumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That machine can go faster than it can
handle the tonnage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is two to three times more
than alfalfa and you go wailing through
[SPEAKER_00]: there with the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go, but it's going to grab
big hunks, pack them together and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: them out the back of the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to watch your forward speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the RPMs up, but watch your forward
speed so it can pull it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't own stock in the company,
but every farmer I know who has bought a
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermeer hook tine tether says it's a
different machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well to do stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really pulls it apart, throws the green
on the top and the dry on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it's fascinating to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well, but you do need to ted
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest, you want to mow it wide,
80% of cutter bar width, ted it after two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your machine is not putting at 80%,
then when you get done mowing the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: go in with the tether and ted it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop it longer, an inch or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chop BMR corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: We chop it long because if we don't,
it falls apart and flushes out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rumen before you get the extent of
digestion that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff will digest faster than BMR
corn will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need the longer particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the longer particles are less likely
to juice if you don't get it dry enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer the particles, the less juicing
is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to infile it the same way the
same day as you mow it, unless it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down below 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's below 40 at night, down into the
30s, you can hold it overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperatures are cold enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you need to get it in the same
day you mow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use a homolactic type bacteria to
get those high sugars to ferment it 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot at you in about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, one of the things that
we've seen in the last year, too,
[SPEAKER_02]: is when people plant too early,
we see a lot more winter cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys may not agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, you know, they're over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing too well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back and forth on that because I had a
study where it was planted early,
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 pounds of nitrogen, planted October,
120 pounds of nitrogen, planted October,
[SPEAKER_00]: no nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dead stuff went right on in over all
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the water set in March when
the ground started to thaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have those virgin clays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get these ponds out there in
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow's melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get these big blazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get flakes in spots you don't expect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow mold comes through and really hammers
it at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get any icing?
[SPEAKER_02]: There might have been a little icing,
but it definitely was more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't run into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah ran into it with hers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't run into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the icing could be a big factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find out this year because I've got
some stuff that's I think I have two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half tons of dry matter out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had 8,000 gallons of manure before I
planted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is set up to get really
nailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flip side is when we get a canopy
like that, if it doesn't smush,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys get feet of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't smush down, then it actually
protects the crowns from the cold so it
[SPEAKER_00]: can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other possibility, knowing where
you're from up there, it's probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: woolly mammoths or mastodons trampled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll back over me in the parking lot for
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have serious reservations about the
varieties you're growing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece that comes in,
I didn't put it in this talk because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a limited amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get it in, especially in your
area with your heavier soils and colder
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be an inch and a quarter in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not an inch and a quarter,
what happens in the springtime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Freezing and thaw, it'll pop it up a half
inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the air dries those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little green stub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, winter kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you didn't get it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hardware issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The loose knot at the steering wheel
didn't plant it deep enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that mistake early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get it shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get it deep enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got royally screwed because it died
on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up in the north, we put our varieties
up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at moving our variety trial
now up to Willsboro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to get it in an inch and a
quarter in the ground at least so it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't heave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ice sheeting and packing down,
I haven't experienced that in 18 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can still happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not when it's growing on the top.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was waiting in on one of our guys who
said they're alfalfa, but they're killed.
And so your idea of planting it into the
triticale truffles that would entree you
[SPEAKER_01]: to then get that spring forward harvest,
do you think you could take in that
[SPEAKER_01]: practice of moving it toward the south?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just since you're planting your
alfalfa earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get, that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can get five tons of dry matter,
six tons of dry matter off your triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good to get three.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing good to get two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you move north, it gets tougher
and tougher because you got to plant it
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty soon, I work with some guys up
in Lacombe, which is two hours north of
[SPEAKER_00]: Calgary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see polar bears from there,
but they're just around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are growing a 60 day corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes 90 days to get it mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're planting all their triticale
in around the 15th of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to get it in early enough to get
the tillering, to get the growth on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the yield and make it through the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have a higher yield potential than
I do because I used to live down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarryville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that long fall and that long
spring there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot more yield potential than I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a picture I sent Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a guy in 2016 planted corn after his
triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a six month old and maybe a two
year old standing next to his corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his corn was tasseled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was as high as the two year old,
which is about this high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said his neighbors wasn't any
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a whole barn or bunk full of
triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will dry the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have heavy ground like Heather
fights with up there all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps to pump the water out in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows you to get on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it turns dry, that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, the first year I did
that alfalfa, I took it off, put the
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa in the beginning of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one three quarter inch rain,
about a week after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a quarter of an inch of
rain the third week in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had nothing through July to the
middle of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Smith looked at my plot in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it looks like a two year old
stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how well it grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some guys in western New York tried it
in 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were amazed at how well it worked
right through the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a little bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air is kept off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it can get dry enough that
nothing grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a perfect system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put stuff in in April and had to
get wiped out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because you're not opening the ground
up and drying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to no till it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open a slit and a press wheel drill,
put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try broadcasting your seed or using
a brilliant seeder and then rolling it
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well just take the seed and
throw it in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben there does have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was that high, it was a very good
chance that has already started sending a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially because beginning of September
we had some really cold weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have got enough chilling that it
burned a line and it's now sending a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may not make it through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because it was planted way too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we have done though is we've
planted beginning of August, we've planted
[SPEAKER_00]: oats, 100 pounds of oats, 80 pounds of
triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take the oats off,
lay the manure in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then take the oats off.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of September cut it four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a couple tons of really nice
oats feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the triticale started growing
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a triticale crop off the next
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get it too early and it grows
too long and it gets a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: vernalize, it's going to get killed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Heather, and Tom again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
