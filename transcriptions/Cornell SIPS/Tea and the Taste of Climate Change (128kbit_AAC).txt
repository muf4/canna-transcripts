[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to be talking about tea
and the taste of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been studying the tea system since
2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, tea is a really interesting way to
examine human interactions with the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment because it is a plant system
that humans have managed for hundreds if
[SPEAKER_00]: not thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm specifically focusing on the
impacts of climate change on tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, climate change is impacting
agro-ecosystems and farmer livelihoods,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the health benefits consumers
get from agricultural products around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a longer frost-free growing
season can help increase the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: specific crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as previous scholars have shown,
this really depends where you are located
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also depends on the specific crop
that you're speaking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's rice or soy, each plant
behaves differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most previous scholars have documented
or focused on looking at the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change on crop yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is relatively well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what my study focuses on with my
collaborators is looking at the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change on crop quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a lot less acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I am looking at this is
through a coupled natural and human
[SPEAKER_00]: systems approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we have our natural system of biotic
and abiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our human system of
traders and consumers and farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of the link between that is the
agro-ecosystem or food production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the feedback loop between the natural
system and the human system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human system that I'm focusing on in
addition to yield is really crop quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the way that the human system
sort of takes that response and then feeds
[SPEAKER_00]: into the natural system is through their
actual adaptation and management of
[SPEAKER_00]: agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously these agro-ecosystems
do not exist on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're impacted by exogenous change such
as climate change, policies, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's sort of the overall
socio-ecological system which I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really a focus on crop quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crop quality is important as I
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not only yields that are
important for food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for the amount of money farmers receive
from selling crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the actual quality of those
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about all of these
sort of diverse foods and vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not only calories but it's also the
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these micronutrients vary based on
management of the agro-ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a carrot grown in an organic
system versus a carrot grown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional system may have varying
levels of the secondary metabolites that
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the main health benefits from
consuming these carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're consuming a carrot that
has relatively low concentrations of these
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites, you're also not
going to be getting the same health
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and have to consume more of the
same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've sort of taken that framework
and applied it to looking at the tea
[SPEAKER_00]: system to see the impacts on tea in my
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really thinking about botanical
quality more broadly of both food and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants which are central to
ethnobotanical health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall objective of my study is to
provide quantitative data, how and why tea
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is vulnerable to changing climate
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at the natural level of the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the resulting linkages to the
social system, both economic as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to go through the main
objectives of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm going to share how climate
is impacting tea quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share some data from field
sampling as well as manipulative
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been using extreme climate events
in the field as a proxy measure for
[SPEAKER_00]: climate events that are supposed to become
more prevalent with climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there's a lot of confounding
factors that occur with field sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm also coupling that with
manipulative greenhouse experiments that
[SPEAKER_00]: mimic climate predicted or expected
climate factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm bringing those samples back
to the lab to look at the phytochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second objective is then to take those
same tea samples and see the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are responding to that variation
in secondary metabolite chemistry through
[SPEAKER_00]: sensory analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my collaborative team, we're also
doing agricultural economics modeling to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at how climate variables are
impacting yields on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third objective is looking at the
way farmers are responding to variations
[SPEAKER_00]: of climate variability in their tea
systems, both based on their direct
[SPEAKER_00]: observation as well as the way they are
responding to markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if consumers are perceiving sensory
variation in tea, how does that impact
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer buying decisions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how does that impact the way
farmers are managing their
[SPEAKER_00]: agro-ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what decisions are they making based
on consumer responses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally the goal is to take all
of this varied socio-ecological data and
[SPEAKER_00]: to construct a model where we'll be able
to simulate the response of tea quality to
[SPEAKER_00]: variable climate factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of this is to develop plans
and policies that we can provide to tea
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and land use managers to better
adapt and mitigate for climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm talking about tea,
I'm specifically talking about Camellia
[SPEAKER_00]: sinensis in the CAC family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the commercial source for all
white, green, oolong, black, and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes from this one single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the variation and the processing
that results in this diversity of flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is from the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Camellia sinensis has two main
cultivars, or two main varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sinensis variety, which is a small
leaf or variety that grows in more
[SPEAKER_00]: temperate areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Assamica variety, which is the
broad leaf variety, which is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: the original variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grows in tropical and subtropical
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to those varieties,
there's also a lot of diversity with lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of farmer land races and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason, particularly in Yunnan
province in southwestern China,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is considered the birthplace of the
tea plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yunnan borders, Myanmar, Vietnam,
and Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this area, you see not just
Camellia sinensis growing, growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild, but also 11 other species that are
closely related to Camellia sinensis that
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers use the germoplasm in their tea
systems for integration, resulting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having this area be sort of the center
of genetic diversity for the tea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a few farmer land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with my background, I would say these
are all Camellia sinensis variety Assamica
[SPEAKER_00]: and DNA bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coding would confirm that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the farmers that I work with in
Yunnan have a different name for each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have different sensory
attributes or uses for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm saying they're all
Camellia sinensis variety Assamica,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot deeper ecological knowledge
and use by the farmers that are managing
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may have 15 to 20 different land
races of tea within a single tea garden of
[SPEAKER_00]: just a hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sort of compare that to our
main food crops in the world, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating to see why and how farmers
manage this diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tea plants can, you know,
tea leaves can grow to different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine one of these tea leaves unfurling
in your teacup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably wouldn't happen so much
over here because usually when tea is
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialized, it's the young,
the new bud and the adjacent two leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are the harvest units for
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in indigenous communities that
have been managing tea for hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: years, farmers do harvest the older
leaves, which they use to make tonics for
[SPEAKER_00]: immune boosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of that harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tea in its native state grows to be a
tall tree, about 15 to 20 meters tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows in these beautiful,
biodiverse forests in southern Yunnan into
[SPEAKER_00]: northeastern India, in Burma and in Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with human management,
that sort of traditional forest system has
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this over here is a tea agroforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks a lot like a forest system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's been intensified for tea
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the woody plant species have
been removed from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of food and medicinal
plants are still maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had done an inventory of about 20 meter
by 20 meter plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found over 200 food and medicinal
plants that were conserved within the
[SPEAKER_00]: space by the community for various needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This over here is a mixed crop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has tea and it's intercropped with
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, tea in most parts of the world
grows in monocultural terrace plantations,
[SPEAKER_00]: really for consistent product and high
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of different
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, based on the different
management, the phytochemical qualities of
[SPEAKER_00]: tea also vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just another note on the management of
these systems, an agroforest, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on a forest structure,
doesn't need to have agrochemical inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: like pesticides and fertilizers,
because it's relying on ecosystem services
[SPEAKER_00]: provided by the forest structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas monocultural plantations,
even if they're organic, generally have
[SPEAKER_00]: agrochemical input of pesticides and
herbicides, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, we're not necessarily
consuming tea in large quantities for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're a black tea drinker
versus a green tea drinker, that variation
[SPEAKER_00]: is because of the change in chemistry that
occurred during processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might buy high mountain teas versus
low mountain teas, because you really have
[SPEAKER_00]: a preference for specific phytochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main phytochemicals for tea that
give its health benefits are the
[SPEAKER_00]: polyphenols, with EGCG being sort of the
star antioxidant compound, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a lot of press and advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those different phytochemicals,
including the polyphenols and methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: xanthine caffeine, which gives tea its
stimulant properties, theanine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes tea sort of a relaxant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have a specific taste which
consumers are able to perceive,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as bitter, sweet, or bitter and
sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really varies, again,
as I mentioned, with environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a little note over here on the
bottom, this shows sort of the evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The historic use of tea is considered to
have been medicine and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioned from medicine to a tonic and
eventually to a beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tea leaves are consumed as a food in some
parts of the world, sort of like a salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tea, I find it a really compelling
study system, because it is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed beverage in the world after
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has really quite widespread
utilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of years of management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also plays an important role in
public health, because it provides a
[SPEAKER_00]: notable source of antioxidant
phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are linked to different benefits
in the human body, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory prevention against
cancer, as well as for cardiovascular
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tea was traditionally sort of the
center of diversity, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: was in southern Yunnan, which is over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of these health benefits
provided by tea, it became requested or
[SPEAKER_00]: demanded in communities that couldn't grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, this red line basically is
the Tea Horse Road, which is the book that
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Varvigas had showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the oldest tea trade route in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, this is the Tibetan
Plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Lhasa over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And communities in the Tibetan Plateau
live in pretty harsh conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's really hard to grow fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came to utilize tea as a
substitute for fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what spurred the
creation off this old, historic road,
[SPEAKER_00]: which not only was tea traded,
but lots of other spices and medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of the first spread of
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as more and more communities
began to know of tea, and it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: through Buddhist monks that spread these,
the consumption of tea, more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: people began to incorporate into their
daily routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to share some
photographs from the Tea Horse Road to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a better cultural context of this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Aka village.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tea farming community in southern
Yunnan, where I've been working since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just some pictures of the Tea Horse
Road itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last picture is tea being consumed
by Tibetan households.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been churned with butter,
yak butter specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is yak butter tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody tried yak butter tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the flavor profile for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Acquired taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was mentioning earlier how the
quality of tea varies based on
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If tea is harvested from a low elevation
versus sort of at the top of the mountain,
[SPEAKER_00]: data suggests that there is phytochemical
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why a lot of consumers seek
out high mountain teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the prices of those are
notably higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at the Atea
agroforest versus a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the work that I had done for
my doctoral dissertation was to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze the different the phytochemical
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an agroforest in an Aka
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a monoculture plantation
nearby at the same elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there was more than
twice the amount of key catechin compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: for tea procured from the agroforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be because of many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be because there's a lot more pest
pressures in an agroforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or because of shade trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or because of the height of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of different factors,
which we're now looking at the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism through greenhouse studies.
What are catechins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, catechins are polyphenolic compounds
that provide antioxidant activity in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of the link to the health
benefits of green tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the variation based on the
production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on geographic region or the
specific cultivar, the phytochemicals also
[SPEAKER_00]: vary in tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in blue here, we have all the different
sort of tea producing areas within China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I mentioned before,
when you process tea from white tea to
[SPEAKER_00]: black tea or post fermented pure tea,
there's also a change in phytochemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: based on all the different processing
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main processing that happens once
tea is harvested is steaming it or pan
[SPEAKER_00]: frying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is to deactivate the polyphenolic
oxidase that oxidizes the catechin
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rolling it to break down the cell walls
and remove moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then drying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really helps preserve the health
compounds attributed to the different
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then variation in these different
processes results in all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my previous work has shown,
as well as that by a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, that consumers can perceive
changes in tea secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a ranking of tea,
100 different teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the less intensely rated teas also had
lower amounts of catechins, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: methylxanthine caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to talk about the cup of
tea that specifically drove my research on
[SPEAKER_00]: the impacts of climate change in tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was during one of my first field
seasons in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in an Aka household drinking tea
after a long day of ecological sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I returned to that same house
about three days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the East Asia monsoon had hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were drinking tea again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the head of the household,
female, says, it has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our husband also drank the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also confirmed that the tea had
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were referring to was that
the East Asian monsoon had hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had sort of transitioned from
a spring harvest to a monsoon harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really attributed to when the
rains come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then quality drops notably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices farmers get for their tea
also drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the autumn harvest is
basically determined by the retrieval of
[SPEAKER_00]: the East Asian monsoon, and at this stage,
the quality is perceived to increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the prices that farmers get for
their tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is an issue not just of the
phytochemicals that we're consuming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the livelihoods that farmers are
getting from their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after her husband tested the tea,
he determined the price to be about half
[SPEAKER_00]: of that of the spring harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just some data showing how
there is a drop in prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the different seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really made me start thinking
about the role that precipitation has in
[SPEAKER_00]: tea quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does this mean with increased or
decreased precipitation that's occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: with climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the central tenant of my study is
sort of looking at tea as an indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: species for climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this can tell us about other
plants that we're using specifically for
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thinking about taste as a sensor
of climate change and its effects on food
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really thinking about the individual
consumer and the role that they're playing
[SPEAKER_00]: in sensing climate change based on taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to share some data from
the natural side component of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the field sampling,
I am working with my collaborators and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're sampling at three different sites in
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or three different regions in China which
are different, sort of, kind of capture
[SPEAKER_00]: the different climatic conditions of major
tea producing areas in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: At each site we have, or location,
we have two sites, a high elevation and a
[SPEAKER_00]: low elevation site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to choose the elevations to be
somewhat the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the cultivar that's in each of
the systems is also, we've accounted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're sampling basically from 2012
till 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a five year study and multiple
seasons within the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal eventually is then to take
all of the data on tea quality and yields
[SPEAKER_00]: from these five years and these six
different locations and combine them to
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually construct our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to share data from one of our
sampling years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our very first sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sampling here and so this was taken
in just one location where we sample
[SPEAKER_00]: basically across 15 days during an extreme
drought period as well as the onset of the
[SPEAKER_00]: monsoon and then during an extreme monsoon
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here we're looking at the
response of leaf biomass from during the
[SPEAKER_00]: drought to the monsoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see an increase in both leaf length
as well as weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then concurrently there is a
significant reduction in secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite concentrations from the spring
drought to the monsoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major antioxidant compounds that
determine tea quality were shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that work I did in the lab using HPLC
as well as some basic bioassays and
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a chemist and so that's why I find
collaboration really to be the spice of
[SPEAKER_00]: life and very promising and fulfilling in
my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm collaborating with some
chemists who are experts at GCGC-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they also are looking at the same
samples where they've developed this
[SPEAKER_00]: really comprehensive tea library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking at the specific
volatiles or aroma compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: determine tea quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also found that there were a few
more aroma compounds in the spring samples
[SPEAKER_00]: or the drought samples compared to the
monsoon samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found an inverse relationship
overall in terms of our leaf weight to
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolite concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests either a dilution effect
and or water stress to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does this sort of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a seasonal study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this sort of mean for larger
climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at precipitation in the field site
shows that there really has been
[SPEAKER_00]: historically, this looks at data from 1980
to 2010, there really historically has
[SPEAKER_00]: been this variation of precipitation
throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall there seems to be a downward
trend in precipitation at the study site,
[SPEAKER_00]: which suggests that tea quality could
actually be getting better with climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, plants do have their threshold as
we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if precipitation becomes too low,
this may just be detrimental to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at, that was sort of
annual precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now looking at seasonal precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, spring precipitation has
increased since 1970, about 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, monsoon
precipitation has also increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the decrease in precipitation was
during the autumn season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when farmers are not harvesting
as much tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking into the future,
future climate scenarios for the 2050 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2079 period shows that precipitation is
expected to decrease during the spring
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, perhaps this may impact tea
quality positively if it doesn't cross the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the monsoon season it's
supposed to be getting wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically farmers are going to be
seeing variable impacts on their tea
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was only just for one year
sampling at one study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to take that sort of
coupled climate and tea quality data for
[SPEAKER_00]: five years at these six locations towards
really having a better understanding and
[SPEAKER_00]: making a stronger statement of climate
effects and tea quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had also only shown data from one
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at tea production
across China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been an upward trend of
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all tea producing sites in China
there's also been, while temperatures are
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing, precipitation overall in tea
producing sites in China is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then overall yields have been
increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is taking into consideration any
changes in technology for tea production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the field we've only sort of looked
at precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature, however, there's multiple
dynamics that are happening, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers are reporting, for example,
changes in pest pressures, different
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, and then changes in pollination
dynamics within their systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future we plan to look at these
a little bit more carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be doing that also in
manipulative greenhouse experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find these experiments really
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to engage undergraduate
students because we don't have to take
[SPEAKER_00]: students all the way to China,
which is also a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also have a little tea
plantation right there in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the undergraduate research
projects looking at different variables
[SPEAKER_00]: actually found that the interaction of
herbivory with precipitation offset the
[SPEAKER_00]: increased precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we're just looking at a single
climate variable, we may have one
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we actually look at the
interactions that are happening within
[SPEAKER_00]: agro-ecosystems, one effect may offset
another effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, some farmers are
accounting for pest as a promising
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy for when their tea quality
decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a specific tea that grows in
Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the increased precipitation
that's happening during the monsoon
[SPEAKER_00]: season, the quality is considered so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, pest pressures are also
increasing in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of putting pesticides as
farmers usually do, they're now actually
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the pests proliferate in their tea
agro-ecosystems because it sort of results
[SPEAKER_00]: in a different change in secondary
metabolite chemistry and actually giving
[SPEAKER_00]: that tea a slightly peachy or honey-like
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are all these different sort
of adaptation strategies that farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking in response to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or climate variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to share some data from
the human system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the major components of the
sensory analysis, and I don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: data to share right now, but I wanted to
just show the different types of sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually going to be speaking to
five different populations since there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of human variation and cultural
variation on the way we respond or
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive tastes and our preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one population are tea farmers,
traders, and connoisseurs in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is an expert tea panel at the
Tea Research Institute of China that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been trained to really measure tea
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are coupling this with tea
populations in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a tea panel at Tufts University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Western tea consumers and Western
tea experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really getting a diverse group of
consumers to see maybe only tea farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: and tea experts are able to perceive this
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Western consumers aren't or maybe
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are sort of the experiments that
we're doing right now to see how notable
[SPEAKER_00]: or who's actually able to discern these
changes in phytochemical quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another major component of the
research is really looking at the way
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are perceiving climate impacts on
their tea systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to share a little bit of
information from three sites in the Bulong
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountains of southwestern China where I
conducted semi-structured surveys with
[SPEAKER_00]: three different indigenous groups,
the Bulong, the Lahu, and the Aka.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took that survey data and
carried out cultural consensus analysis to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at variation within a community and
between communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some overall patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are reporting that there is
increased rainfall, unpredictability,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as increased temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers are also saying that they
really perceive that rain impacts tea
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're not really sure how
temperatures increase or impact tea
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some information that perhaps
our tea project will be able to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within these three different
indigenous groups that all are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulong Mountains, we did find high degree
of informant agreement on the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently I've started to interview
tea farmers that don't own the land or
[SPEAKER_00]: these three indigenous communities have
been managing tea agro ecosystems or their
[SPEAKER_00]: communities have for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really have this ecological
knowledge that has been passed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently in eastern China I've
been interviewing tea farmers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more landless laborers that have only
been, some of them only recently
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced this tea system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a very different
understanding of the way climate is
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting their tea systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that all farmers are aware of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really seeing that the indigenous
farmers have a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding compared to farmers that
have not necessarily managed an agro
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem for that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers that are aware of it are
also very concerned on the impact that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has on tea prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this inverse relationship
of precipitation and tea price
[SPEAKER_00]: historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how are farmers responding to these
different changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here I've sort of summarized from the
coding of the data some of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer responses to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some farmers have started to substitute
different varieties and make their tea
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens more diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are actually planting other crops
just so they aren't putting all their eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: in one basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some modification of the
environment with technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example in places where they have
really intense droughts farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to think about having irrigation
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had mentioned the example of letting
pests proliferate in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also alteration of post-harvest
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so during processing you can really
also change the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some teas that were historically
processed as green teas are now being
[SPEAKER_00]: processed as oolongs or blacks where
they're really taking advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: processing to enrichen the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some repurposing of the end
use of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall in certain communities people
are very active in sort of thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to market their products differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in some communities people are
abandoning their tea systems or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: relocating the locations maybe to higher
elevations in the mountain which they
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive as having or being more resilient
to climate effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I previously had talked about these
two different systems, the agri-forest
[SPEAKER_00]: entity monoculture and a lot of the
farmers who do manage both systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This monoculture system has really been
promoted throughout China through
[SPEAKER_00]: government extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grain for Green program or policy
actually gave farmers incentives to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some communities you see farmers
managing both an agri-forest as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers that manage both will say
how their agri-forests are more resilient
[SPEAKER_00]: to different climate variation that
happens from year to year or from season
[SPEAKER_00]: to season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at the drop in tea quality
there was a slightly smaller drop or
[SPEAKER_00]: notably smaller drop in tea quality for
agri-forest compared to the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is only sampling over one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be continuing this to
see this trend uphold in more sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: An agri-forest also, you know,
provide a lot more economic benefits to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue line over here is looking at
the market price at this field site for
[SPEAKER_00]: tea from an agri-forest and the orange is
looking at during the same season price
[SPEAKER_00]: for terrace or monoculture plantation tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers really do have an economic
incentive not just an ecological incentive
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow this, to grow tea in agri-forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of my previous work also
showed that agri-forests have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more genetic diversity or notably more
genetic diversity than terrace
[SPEAKER_00]: plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so taking all of this information that
I presented today, just having you think
[SPEAKER_00]: as an audience of the role of taste as a
sensor of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if you personally or have
had relatives or friends say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this fruit or vegetable used to taste
really different before when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that might have to do perhaps
with the way it's cultivated or some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that might actually have to do with
climate variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then specifically I'm thinking about
tea as an indicator species of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change, but what other crops can we look
at to be an indicator species for climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the role of adaptive capacity in
determining the extent of climate effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's one body of work that
really focuses on mitigating climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and the other work that really
focuses on adapting to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would it mean for sustainability?
[SPEAKER_00]: If monoculture plantations transitioned to
systems like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall I've been starting to use this
coupled model to look at other systems as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, not just tea quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I leave you with a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is climate change changing the taste and
quality of our favorite and or local
[SPEAKER_00]: foods?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does this mean for farmer
livelihoods?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does it mean for the health
benefits that we derive from these
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty crops and for food security?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, as I've been expanding
my research using this socio-ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: model, I've started to look at the impacts
of climate change on maple syrup quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's some really great
research happening here at Cornell looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the impacts of climate change on maple
syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently my collaborators and I got a
USGS grant to look at this, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically focusing on the impacts on
quality versus yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Montana, where I teach,
I'm also starting to look at two new
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, which are huckleberries and
fathead cherries, which are two
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural products that the state
really prizes for its cultural identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to thank you as an
audience for being here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much, Dr. Rodriguez,
for hosting me and to Tara for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination of this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also wanted to acknowledge my
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very interdisciplinary
collaborative project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very much determines the nature
of my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students and undergraduate students are
huge parts of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: As are the farming communities that I work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the National Science
Foundation for making the work possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: A change in the taste of tea over the
past, like, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: A green tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough for the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm curious, well, maybe it's climate
change, but I'm curious, does it come from
[SPEAKER_04]: different places, what's visible to us
here now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it used to come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it come from less tasty places?
[SPEAKER_00]: So more and more, if the United States tea
has started to come from South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Argentina, as well as in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot more tea is being sort of
redirected from Asia to new tea producing
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the change in geographic
location could be one factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess also from where companies are
sourcing the quality of the tea they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to study somewhere where the
rates of cancer of the esophagus was very
[SPEAKER_03]: high in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was partly related to the teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm correct, the way they prepare
it is they use extremely hot water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on the specific type
of tea, but a lot of times when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: on the go, they'll just grab really hot
water and put tea leaves into it if there
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are sort of drinking tea at
home, it's usually not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of the population that
sort of drinks tea where the water is
[SPEAKER_00]: really hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because basically the MacRusas
water, it was because they drank the tea
[SPEAKER_03]: so hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, of course, the catechism themselves,
which could be quite damaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering whether you did see
any kind of high rates of cancer among
[SPEAKER_03]: these tea drinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I guess I would say the
inverse in the communities that I work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, they really don't have a prevalence
of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really something that's come
up in MacRusas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not actually very familiar with that
specific study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I would say the meta-analysis
and reviews have been done on the health
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have shown that it's been
beneficial for various health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it depends on the type of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not actually familiar with that
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if it's a yuk or whatever
you call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Milk is actually very beneficial in the
fact that that's why the Brits,
[SPEAKER_03]: when they added milk, they added the last
rate of cancer of the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was apparently reactive in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was persilatating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the catechism, they were not as
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering whether... Yes,
that's interesting because most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: catechins are linked to the health
benefits of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would have to look at that study.
[SPEAKER_02]: While your data shows that there are
changes in precipitation patterns during
[SPEAKER_02]: the monsoon season, monsoons have always
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would assume that the quality and
therefore the price of tea harvest it
[SPEAKER_02]: during or after the monsoon has
traditionally dropped for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think there's always been sort
of a variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sort of now seems that the
variation is becoming larger with more
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in climate events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is something that's always happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like it's becoming a little
bit more variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you showed a huge variation in price
between the plantation tea and the
[SPEAKER_03]: agroforestry tea?
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost tenfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is driving this very high price for
the agroforestry tea?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you see this difference when you do
your GC mass spec on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about more than 99% of the tea produced
in the world is in terrace plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is just supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little agroforest tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a system that's really been replaced
in the last 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so supply is really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't just create an agroforest
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though monoculture plantations or
terrace farms might see, oh, that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive, you can't suddenly have all
these trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the purchases valuing in that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the purchases valuing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes a person 10 times more?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's scarcity, but most people
won't do that just because it's scarce.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something they must be appreciating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had just briefly showed the
difference in the fiber chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just the catechins that are
attributed to the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the flavor is a lot more intense
from an agroforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can definitely perceive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the indicators of really high
quality tea, if you don't have a GC,
[SPEAKER_00]: GC, or HPLC in your kitchen, is the taste
lingers a lot more when you have a tea
[SPEAKER_00]: from an agroforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called gan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really high quality tea might have
that honey-like taste back in your throat
[SPEAKER_00]: for more than an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can sort of, you know,
it resonates for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is around 2000 to 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the price of
agroforest tea also hasn't always been the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really increased since 2002 over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the prices have really been increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that period between 2002 and 2003,
there were a lot of reports saying Taiwan
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hong Kong of negative health effects
from drinking tea, physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were attributes to pesticides
and herbicides in tea plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really during that period that
people began to sort out organic tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the agroforest had absolutely no
chemical input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really, it tastes a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people felt safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in teas, you could, you know,
there's high pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your throat sort of feel dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of wet, as I call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the TCC value for white tea
versus, let's say, oolong?
[SPEAKER_01]: The value?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, so I had done a study looking
at, there's a lot of variation on tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like not all white teas, teas are the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all sweet teas are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all oolongs are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within, let's say, just one type of white
tea, like silver needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the manufacturer and how long
it's been stored, there's significant
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the main catapults and the
contrast in tea degrade after six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you who have a positive tea
that you've been storing, remember fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: is best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's poor tea, which actually is
supposed to get better with age.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best way to store it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so it's sort of the traditional
things for preserving biochemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sort of a cool temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving as much of the air,
so kind of a nice sealed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bag, I usually sort of like
move as much of the air in the bag as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in a really big container,
so in a little bit of tea, put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller sort of airtight container,
and then keep it out of the dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: or keep it out of the light.
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
