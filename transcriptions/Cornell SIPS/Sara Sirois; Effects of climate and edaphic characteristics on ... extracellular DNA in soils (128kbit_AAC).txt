[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to thank you all for being
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you a little bit about
the research I've been doing looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the stabilization and degradation dynamics
of extracellular DNA in soils and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically how those dynamics are
impacted by agricultural management and
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question you might have is
what is extracellular DNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: So extracellular or eDNA is any DNA strand
that's not contained within a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in soils, as in other natural
environments, eDNA arises when the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of a living cell is either actively
secreted or, more commonly, a cell will
[SPEAKER_00]: die, it will lyse, and its cellular
contents will spill out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in soils, eDNA is important for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namely, it's an important source of
nitrogen and phosphorus, so it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: for nutrient cycling, it's an important
structural and functional component of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial biofilms, and it's a key player
in horizontal gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the purposes of this talk,
we're really concerned about the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: that eDNA presents to introduce bias to
our estimates of microbial community
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question has really risen to the
forefront in recent years due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing accessibility of high
throughput sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who aren't familiar
with this method, the basic workflow is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you take a sample, you can extract
the total DNA from that sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will include both intracellular and
extracellular DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can amplify a gene of interest and
then directly sequence those amplicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under the sequencing conditions that
we use in the Buckley lab, we expect
[SPEAKER_00]: between tens and hundreds of thousands of
sequences per sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of information,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we analyze that information,
one of the key assumptions that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: making is that every DNA sequence that we
see derives directly from a living cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is the cell is present in the
soil, it's alive and well, you kill it
[SPEAKER_00]: when you extract its DNA, and then you can
draw direct comparisons between your
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences and the living cells in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eDNA violates that key assumption,
namely because the cell from which eDNA
[SPEAKER_00]: came might have been dead for a long time,
but that eDNA remains stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenceable in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't tell those apart,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the areas of eDNA research where
there's general consensus is that eDNA can
[SPEAKER_00]: be stabilized on soil minerals,
specifically clays and to some extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: sands, and also on soil organic matter,
that eDNA can persist over long periods of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and that it can make up a really
large portion of the soil DNA pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally on the order of like 20% to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not insubstantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we lack consensus, however,
is when we start to ask questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: the extent to which eDNA is introducing
bias to our estimates of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a paper that came out last
year where they took a reagent that
[SPEAKER_00]: targets specifically extracellular DNA,
they treated soils with that reagent to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove eDNA, and then compared the
sequences from the treated soils to the
[SPEAKER_00]: untreated soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found is that there was a
significant eDNA-driven bias in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial richness, diversity,
and community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for microbial ecologists, this is big
news, and it's bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if that's always true,
it means that the work that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for years has this unaccounted for
source of bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was another paper that came out
last year also where they used a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, but a different reagent,
so comparing treated and untreated soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they found that regardless of the
size, of the eDNA pool, so even when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like 80%, there was still no
significant eDNA-driven bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a researcher to think,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these two really well-respected
labs telling us completely contradictory
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a way to wade into this
conversation, I wanted to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis that the degradation dynamics
of eDNA, which will influence eDNA-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: bias, vary across gradients of both
agricultural management and also habitat
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to start with, I needed soils from
a management gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I chose to use samples from a
long-term corn trial that's been running
[SPEAKER_00]: in cheesy New York, which is way up in the
North Country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a multi-decade study where
they've been applying factorial
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of intensive tillage,
no-till, corn biomass removal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and corn biomass return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has resulted in a really clear
management gradient that's accompanied by
[SPEAKER_00]: a really clear soil or grain matter
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for my habitat gradient,
I chose to sample more locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Monkey Run right here in Ithaca,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I collected samples from agriculture,
meadow, and forest soils at that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I was testing this hypothesis,
I was also bearing in mind two sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of those is, what is controlling
the degradation and stabilization dynamics
[SPEAKER_00]: of eDNA in soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second of those was, over what
time scale do we expect any eDNA-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: bias to be apparent?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try and answer these questions,
I performed a series of laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: microcosm experiments where I put some
soil into a microcosm, and then I added a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic eDNA marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is real DNA made of nucleotides,
but it was synthesized in a way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this marker contains two different sets
of primer sites that allow me to do two
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first of those, shown here in
green, here and here, well, white at
[SPEAKER_00]: least, is a high-throughput sequencing
appropriate primer site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be targeted by universal
bacterial sequencing primers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other primer site that I built into
this synthetic eDNA were primer sites that
[SPEAKER_00]: are specific only to this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are primers that we don't expect to
amplify anything else in our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I add my soil in my eDNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I allow my microcosms to incubate,
and I periodically collect subsamples of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from each of those subsamples,
I collect total DNA, or extract total DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this total DNA will contain
both any DNA that was natively present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, but it will also contain however
much of my synthetic eDNA gene is still
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my total DNA, and then taking
advantage of those two different primer
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, I use two different types of
analysis on the same DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of those was an eDNA
marker-specific quantitative PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a technique that will measure
only the synthetic eDNA gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not telling me anything about the
rest of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second technique that I use is
high-throughput sequencing, the technique
[SPEAKER_00]: I was describing earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this technique is going to tell me not
only about how much of the synthetic eDNA
[SPEAKER_00]: is present, but also about what that looks
like in the context of the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial community from the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with, these are the qPCR
data from the management gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have here on the y-axis the amount
of eDNA that remains in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we move across the x-axis,
we're moving through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we note is that between
time 0 and day 7, so that's a one-week
[SPEAKER_00]: interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out that this is a log
scale on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're seeing in that first week is
a two to three order of magnitude decline
[SPEAKER_00]: in the amount of eDNA marker that's still
present, followed by relative stability
[SPEAKER_00]: across the rest of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to better understand these data,
I fit them using a nonlinear least squares
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling approach with a Weibel type
mortality curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this type of curve has three
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a starting value parameter,
so that's sort of up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a decay rate parameter,
which is sort of going to be in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then an asymptote parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nature of the model allows us to
compare those parameters between
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to stop here and say that the
starting quantity parameter is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: across all of our data and all of our data
sets, which is by design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel good that that was the result
we got, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to start with the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we're really looking for
differences is in the decay rate term and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the asymptote, or the stabilization
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see for our management data is
that, first off, we were not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect any differences in the decay rate
terms between treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to sort of drive home at this
point that that two to three order of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnitude decline in eDNA in the first
week means that there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation that was happening that we
didn't capture sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really coarse resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that there might be
differences in decay rate that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't able to see because of the courses
of our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we are able to see is a
difference in stabilization between
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that stabilization was
significantly different and greater under
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till management than it was in our
tilled samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no-till management is resulting in
greater eDNA stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next bit of data I want to show you
is the high-throughput sequencing data
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same management gradient,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the same tubes of DNA
analyzed in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably noticed that this looks a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still looking at the amount of eDNA
that's present on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're moving through time on the
x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still seeing a two to three order of
magnitude decline in that first seven
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really different about the
sequencing data versus the qPCR data is
[SPEAKER_00]: that with the qPCR, we were able to detect
the eDNA marker in every sample at every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with the high-throughput
sequencing, at time, well, seven days
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we start to lose the ability to see
that eDNA in some of our samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these samples that are sitting
right down here on the x-axis,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are samples where we were not able
to detect eDNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the samples where we were able to
detect the eDNA up here are inching really
[SPEAKER_00]: close to this horizontal line,
which represents our estimated limit of
[SPEAKER_00]: detection for high-throughput sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, high-throughput sequencing
is a less sensitive method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even early on, we start to lose the
ability to detect that eDNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of this lack of
sensitivity, we weren't able to detect any
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between treatments at any
time, which is in sharp contrast to the
[SPEAKER_00]: qPCR data where we were able to detect
differences between the tilled and the
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to sort of pause and really
drive home that point about differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity, namely that qPCR is a much
more sensitive method of detection than
[SPEAKER_00]: high-throughput sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that difference in sensitivity is
going to impact our ability to see
[SPEAKER_00]: eDNA-driven bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So method sensitivity is going to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to bring us back into the
data now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you the habitat gradient
data plotted and modeled in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: as the management data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're seeing a two to three
order of magnitude decline in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: week, followed by relative stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still using that same modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we were able to detect a
difference between decay rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: namely in that the decay rate of the
forest soils was significantly different
[SPEAKER_00]: from and slower than the decay rate of the
meadow soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forest has slower degradation than
meadow soils initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of the experiment,
it's the meadow soil that has
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly more or significantly
different and more stabilization than
[SPEAKER_00]: either the agriculture or the forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this decoupling between initial
degradation and stabilization and
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term degradation and stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at the sequencing
data for those same tubes, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar things to what we saw with
the management data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still able to detect the eDNA
standard at time zero in all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still seeing a two to three order of
magnitude decline in that first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to lose the ability to
detect the eDNA in those samples with our
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we couldn't detect any
differences between treatments with our
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pause there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it back to this hypothesis that I
was testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was testing whether or not eDNA
degradation dynamics would vary across
[SPEAKER_00]: gradients of habitat and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I demonstrated that those do both
impact eDNA degradation dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both tillage being part of management
and habitat influence stabilization in the
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the follow-up question that I was
asking was what's controlling eDNA
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation and stabilization dynamics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to try and get at this question,
because remember, in the management
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient, I saw there was a really strong
soil organic matter gradient that went
[SPEAKER_00]: along with that management gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so soil organic matter seems like a
really good place to start when looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for the underlying controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked for a correlation between soil
organic matter that I'm using percent
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon as a proxy for with the amount of
eDNA that was still present at one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is after that initial precipitous
decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that there is a strong
positive correlation between soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and initial eDNA stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this correlation is strongly
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells us that soil organic matter is
playing a role here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, when we look not at
initial stabilization, but rather at
[SPEAKER_00]: longer-term stabilization, so by the end
of the experiment, that correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: completely disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, drives home that point
that there is a decoupling between initial
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation and stabilization and
long-term degradation and stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second follow-up question that I
was asking was over what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question was what's controlling
those degradation dynamics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that decoupling is telling us is
that we're pretty agreed that DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: entering the soil as eDNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something happens, and then some portion
of that eDNA that enters the soil might
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately be stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of questions about how
much of the eDNA gets stabilized,
[SPEAKER_00]: over what time scales, by what methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our results suggest that when eDNA
enters the soil, one of the controls
[SPEAKER_00]: between entrance and stabilization is soil
carbon, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's having an impact on what kind of
proceeds on this pathway towards
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our results also tell us that soil
carbon isn't the only thing controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other processes or set of
processes that are controlling whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not the eDNA that enters the system is
ultimately stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, that second question I was asking
is over what time scales do we expect
[SPEAKER_00]: eDNA-driven bias to be apparent?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this figure is for illustrative
purposes only.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're showing is that if we take
the QPCR data, where we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect the eDNA in all samples at all
times, and we overlay that sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: method data with the limit of detection of
our less sensitive high-throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing, which is a more common
technique and in many ways more
[SPEAKER_00]: informative, what we're looking for is the
time that it takes after eDNA addition for
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of eDNA to drop below that
high-throughput sequencing limit of
[SPEAKER_00]: detection, which you can sort of think of
as a veil line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA might still be present,
but once it's below that limit of
[SPEAKER_00]: detection, you can't see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not impacting your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this figure shows us that with a
treatment that has really slow
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation, the time that it takes
between when the eDNA enters the system
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it drops below that veil is going
to be longer than in a really fast
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation treatment, where that time
will be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to have practical
implications for sampling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are doing time core sampling and
you are concerned about will my results be
[SPEAKER_00]: biased by eDNA, these are going to be
important numbers for you to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you the numbers that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out at this point that
I did this sort of analysis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat data as well as for the management
data down here, but that I also looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact of moisture and temperature
which were not data that I presented
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But across all of these different
treatments, we're seeing a pretty wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of, you can think of it as sort of a
delay between when the eDNA is added and
[SPEAKER_00]: when it disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shortest time that we saw was a day
and a half, and that was in a very high
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that DNA was pretty much gone
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: As compared to a really low temperature
treatment, four degrees, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that that eDNA sticks around above
the limit of detection for nearly two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is telling us that differential eDNA
degradation has an impact on how much bias
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing in our results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the directions that I think this
project should take in the future are
[SPEAKER_00]: first off to really explore that
relationship between short and long term
[SPEAKER_00]: eDNA degradation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this decoupling between initial and
long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that, it's going to be
important for us to understand why we
[SPEAKER_00]: could see that tillage and habitat
impacted long term stabilization,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that soil organic carbon, which seemed
like a really likely culprit, wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really driving that all the way through
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other processes are involved here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it aggregation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it urology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it some other process or set of
processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition to answering those
questions, it's going to be important for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to gain better resolution in that first
week after eDNA addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So turns out that sampling after one week
is a little too coarse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to address that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and look at what that data tells
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the experiments that I
did are useful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also really important to note
that they have their limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main limitations of this
type of experiment is that I'm adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of eDNA at once, and then I'm
watching that same eDNA marker degrade,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, and go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in natural systems, we see constant
turnover of DNA, of microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that one time addition isn't really
representative of what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do repeated eDNA additions,
which are more representative of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in reality, how do they impact
degradation and stabilization of eDNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to tie this all together, right,
we had this controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the things that I can say,
you know, we might not be able to say
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not we have, like, maybe all is
lost, maybe all isn't lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can say conclusively is that
it's highly likely that gradients of
[SPEAKER_00]: management and habitat and moisture and
temperature will result in differential
[SPEAKER_00]: eDNA-driven bias in our results,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these gradients matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we're going to need to use
caution when we sample with really fine
[SPEAKER_00]: time point resolution because of that sort
of delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd like to end by acknowledging my
committee, Dan and Joe, who have both been
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in helping me organize and
execute these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank the whole Buckley lab
for your humor and your patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a specific shout out to Rolly and Sam
for their help with sequence analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Dennis at the
Statistical Consulting Unit, and I'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to thank my monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone has any questions,
I will gladly take those.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the steady state concentration of
DNA in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the eDNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: My eDNA addition?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what you would find in nature in
various places of ballpark food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to depend on the soil
specifically, but generally we see between
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% and 80% of the total DNA will be DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about in picograms or hemograms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two micrograms per gram is sort of a
maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question about the sample
preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get rid of eDNA by just using
different preparation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sort of subtract the cells from
eDNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few different methods that
people try to use to remove eDNA or sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of segregate eDNA from intracellular DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two studies that I talked about
earlier, the first one used a DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: intercalating dye called TMA that didn't
remove the eDNA from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second study that I discussed
just used a DNA that got the extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, some people will do cell
separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious about the controversy
between these two papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite a dramatic difference,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you look into the methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anything sort of distract you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be different between these two
methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the method itself, it's an
extraction, it's how they sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so tact is not my strong suit,
so I'm going to try and be really
[SPEAKER_00]: diplomatic right now, which is to say that
my immediate reaction when I read both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those papers was to start pointing out
flaws in their methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could do that, but it seemed more
productive to rather than try and like
[SPEAKER_00]: tear down what people had done to try and
sort of add to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the methods that they use,
specifically the DNA intercalating dye
[SPEAKER_00]: could be really powerful, but there's also
you're sort of like many, many steps away
[SPEAKER_00]: from nature at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are always flaws in the methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as research into this
eDNA-driven bias increases, like the more
[SPEAKER_00]: people who read these papers will be like,
oh crap, we're totally, everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are going to really nail
down the best way to address eDNA.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
