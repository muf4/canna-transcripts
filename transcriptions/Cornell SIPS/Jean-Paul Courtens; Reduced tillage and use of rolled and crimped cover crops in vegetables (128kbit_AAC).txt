[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly, introduction of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently the Associate Director of
Farming Training and Farm Ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also the co-owner of Roxbury Farm
in Kinderhook, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a biodynamic farm in 425 acres
where we do vegetables and pork,
[SPEAKER_00]: beef and lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last four years I've been involved
with this project in Hurley, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 1200 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years of farmland, class one silt loam,
form a sweet corn, conventional sweet corn
[SPEAKER_00]: farm that I was asked to help transition
to organic practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my task has been to help them
guide them through the process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation and bring this land into
ecological practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that is that we're working with
the Farmscape Ecology Program based in
[SPEAKER_00]: Harlenville, New York to not just look at
soil data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the soil health test to
monitor soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at water quality and
looking at ecological qualities on the
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in our third year right now to
do this monitoring and mapping and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: additional research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the context of, and do I have a
clicker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the context really of the pharma
training program that we started which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really meant to as the niche in the pharma
training program that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of them around in the Hudson
Valley in New York, to see if we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a pharma training program that can allow
our students to scale up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare them for farm ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an entrepreneurial training
whereby we really want to prepare them for
[SPEAKER_00]: farm ownership and with the ability to be
exposed somewhat to working with
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I do with my
students is that I really want to push
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very cushy environment in the
sense that we can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it all my life and I was happy
to continue doing that while being paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we were
really struggling with is that yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know how to grow vegetables,
but can we grow vegetables in an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that the one thing that we
bump up against with organic vegetables is
[SPEAKER_00]: really that we do a lot of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who know me know that I like to
work with weeding equipment and keeping my
[SPEAKER_00]: fields clean, although I also have worked
very extensively with cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very long ago we adopted a Nordale system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anyone familiar with the Nordales?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are my heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been alternating on our
vegetable farm in Kinderhook with cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops one year, green manures,
and then vegetable crop production the
[SPEAKER_00]: other year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually improved our soil health
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I heard a lot today about saying
that we cannot increase organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: with cover crops alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is really how tall were these
cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have really brought our organic
matter up from about 1.2, 1.4 to 2.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes 15 years to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things is is it another
farm that I transition from very intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables to organic vegetables is that
we inherit the two farms where with excess
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of phosphorus and excessive amount
of potassium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing in animal fertilizer is not an
option for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that we could complement
really growing organic vegetables was by
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing significant amount of nitrogen
into our system by fixing nitrogen out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also by doing that we have also fixed
tremendous amount of carbon out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to the pro-pharma training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pushing them to do something more
innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, okay, we've looked at all the
stuff that's being done with minimum till
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to try a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I lost the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do quite a bit of conventional till
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curriculum is based on five groups of
vegetables of which some of the groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetables in the brassica,
the brassica is one group, lend themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: quite well for a particular part in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for the early brassicas, but
definitely for the later brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be planted in rolled and crimped vetch
or rolled and crimped arson field piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the other group that we have are the
legumes lend themselves very well to be
[SPEAKER_00]: planted through rolled and crimped rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, my apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone thought I was going to talk
about mixed species here, I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about mixed or mixtures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vetch or rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to address the whole idea
about if you are planting your brassicas
[SPEAKER_00]: in rye, we already know that we're going
to be having to bring in a lot of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: to offset the fact that the rye is so high
in carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to make sure that we could
bring the vetch, the vetch would bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen needed for the brassicas to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually, let me say one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to really talk much about
the edamame and the snap beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of like the easy ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been growing at the farm hub
soybeans through rolled and crimped rye
[SPEAKER_00]: for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good weed control in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we learned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap beans work equally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were a little concerned with the
machine harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to pick up the rye straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't an issue at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to focus on is more on this
one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian winter peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we tried field peas with bell beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used for many years a rotation
whereby I plant field peas and bell beans
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring, and I work them under,
and that gives us up to 200 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen to grow a broccoli, cauliflower,
and cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I know that we are fixing that
much because Laurie Greenwater had a
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student go out and actually find
out how much we were actually fixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't put any fertilizer down
except boron to grow these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we rolled and crimped them,
they disappeared too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Australian winter peas stayed around a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using a crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also what we do is we were
thinking like how are we going to kill it
[SPEAKER_00]: all in one shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were thinking about it with the
pro farmers who went around, and we said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, why don't you just cut it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an indeterminate crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem with that is that it
flowers at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either we're going to roll it three
times and get going over it, or we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try to kill it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just hooked behind our tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hooked the no-till drill, and we just
cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cutting actually immediately
killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good stand of the Australian
winter peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing we wanted to
resolve it, how are you going to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought this RJ Planner that Ryan uses
as well in free fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got that from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we enjoyed working with it,
except that we think that maybe it is more
[SPEAKER_00]: than what we really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're founding is that we really
don't need some of the equipment on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the row cleaners off almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the shinglers, the colliger
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a shank here that they
insisted to have on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ground is pretty soft in a
minimum-till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a no-till system by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took great care in preparing the
seedbed in the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really, all you need really to
plant into a crop like this is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: double disc opener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here is a wavy coulter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this and a double disc opener,
you can use any transplanted to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 26th of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see the weeds were coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we definitely saw we didn't have
enough biomass to really have good weed
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was good growth in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we ended up doing,
we went to it with a Lillestone rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to clean it up after every pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, it worked relatively
decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the crew hand hoe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I cannot share how many
hours it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 0.7 acre piece that we hand
hoed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was definitely about between 40 and
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hours that I remember that we spent on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, cost was not an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kept growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's some weeds growing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, the canopy starts to
close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the weeds are growing a little
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, I hope, that this slides on the
same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, this is really important
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, none of this is what I'm bringing
to you as research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really like us trying some things
out and throwing some paint at the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigated equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plot, we did a side by side
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wilting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this one here,
even with the weed competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no wilting over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: After mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yield is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's about the same as in our
conventional plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first one that I want to
share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the vetch, we tried that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an indeterminate plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we didn't do with the rye,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rye, we just waited until it
entices, rolled it, and rolled it again
[SPEAKER_00]: after the soybeans came up, the edamame
came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's all cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how that's all cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually just a slide again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is actually meant for the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a cauliflower later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more slide of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn after planting in the vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually saw much better weed
control in the corn from the vetch than we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw in the Austrian field peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn, again, observations, very healthy
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, less the wilting point was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of such a degree that it didn't
seem to suffer as much with hot days
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some weeds coming in,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the canopy is closing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all irrigated fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mention that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is close to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 300 bags to the acre, which was
more than our conventional till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conventional was around 250 bags to
the acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a surprising number to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that the ears were fuller from that
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it had something to do with no
water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was something to say for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for us to compare one lot to the
other, especially when you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have bird damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 300 bags marketable ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is not research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, it was a good yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see these yields consistently when
we transplant corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody always laughs when we transplant
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find that we can plant twice as
much corn from half the acre to be
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted because of the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grow the extra tender varieties
that really don't germinate very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we also transplant a cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: True vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just showing some later slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through the whole
sequence again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is hoeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did spend some time hoeing there,
pulling out the big weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we went out there, we had a
fissa by Jan Hendrik Krupp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Klaus Martens already mentioned him
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came by the farm up and he went out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing, give me a shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And educational for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should have taken slides from the
conventional till plots because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, we had some really,
it's hard to see on this slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's wormholes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the worms right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really remarkable difference
in soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil wasn't blocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a nice rounded texture to it where
it was in the cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the cauliflower, it was
conventional till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it may be a better shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone familiar with Jan Hendrik Krupp?
[SPEAKER_00]: September 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That crop stayed really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoeing in here was relatively minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did pull out some big weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: September 21st.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have yield numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, I come again with some anecdotal
stuff regarding what the crew was telling
[SPEAKER_00]: me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They loved harvesting cauliflower in that
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, this is a really clean
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cauliflower is really high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really, the crop did not
deteriorate as fast in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we had less tip burn in this
cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot to do with the water
management, I think, of the soil that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this really started as an experiment
and saying, okay, we have nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to continue with this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we already did mix in some
triticale and some rye vetch to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that the triticale and rye will
not dominate the vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something to see if we get better
weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step is for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sold on this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step right now for us will be to
see if we can eliminate the hand hoeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep it short because the IPA is
waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: How long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a date on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could actually tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think normally when I do weed
control, I control weeds when I can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the normal way of thinking about
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, and that's where the Lilston
comes in, the weeds were about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some over the carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hence the aggressive way of using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many weeks it was after I have to look
up the dates again if I go back through
[SPEAKER_00]: the slides?
[SPEAKER_00]: The broccoli, I could not have waited much
longer because I would have been driven
[SPEAKER_00]: with my tractor tires on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty soon after that, the canopy
started to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't get the second part of your
question.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty weedy ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the conventional till, it would be
cultivated three times by that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the Austrian field piece
compared to the Vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the Vetch had better weed
control than the Austrian field piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you put the regular 4D10 field
piece, it's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We abandoned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, after rolling and crimping,
we made a visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we walked the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, all right, is this going to
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see weeds right now, then we're not
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that has to do with a fall
seeding of Austrian field piece is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were very little weeds under the
Austrian field piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the 4D10 field piece and the bell
beans, weeds germinated along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: field piece that were planted in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we saw weeds, and if anyone wants to
try this, I would say that the one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we learned from this is that we do
all our weeding in the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the year before we planted the field
piece, the Austrian field piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Vetch, and the rye, we had a bare
fallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is by no means like we didn't do
tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of tillage in the year
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made sure we did all our tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our aim is not to be no till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our aim is to not disturb the soil and to
provide greater plant health now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to have too much erosion when the
plants are still young.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, none of these crops got any
fertilizer except for borax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even the corn.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so pretty much we didn't have to
apply a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This no till drill does have hydraulic
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't take a lot of pressure to
have the colters run and cut the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: They cut only into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't cut underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't cut underneath.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't kill the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more the action of those wheels that
are sliding back to the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a possibility, although I think
that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do we say, Matt, about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the no till drill,
what do you think the action was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it was the second rolling
that did all the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it the cutting?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that the wheels would be
able to provide enough pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably a combination in reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that smashing it down is
really going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the cutting or rolling that blade
over, if you're not running the rye and
[SPEAKER_02]: going down and going in between it,
then you're cutting something,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're putting pressure directly on
those stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that would probably have a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you're saying about the gauge
wheels helping out there, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: like they have any points on them where
it's pretty soft.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also, when you drive over a vetch
at a certain growth stage with the
[SPEAKER_02]: tractor, under the wheels, you'll see a
dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that's a lot more weight,
though, on the tractor and tire,
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the weight of an individual
gauge wheel, where you have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: them lined up in a row like that with the
no till drill.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the unit, on the no till drill,
can be 200 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the coulter, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the unit, can be quite a lot on those
down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe you cut, when you cut
straight down, that you would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is cut every 7 and 1 half inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these coulters are quite close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just thought it was the cutting,
and maybe it's not the cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we rolled some stuff, and then we
did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, it's not dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's run over to the no till drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we actually are going to go to a
smaller plant that's only two weeks old.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were, I believe, 18 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were actually, they're a double
plant in a 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go back to a double plant in a
162, because it just took too much time to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry the trades to the trans planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one thing that we have to buy
another shoe for that with the RJ planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was one thing we want to correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we needed a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had not done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely stick with a 162.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we plant every 14 inches, two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
One last question.
What do you see as your next crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next crop we will try, aside from
those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick to those for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to try a little bit with the
transfer mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially, try it on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring mulch on after the potatoes are
planted, enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put the mulch on top of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not to touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do have some weed issues in the
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole different system
altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
