[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you for coming this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be a little different
seminar from what you're used to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of receiving some data and some
facts, we're going to have the students
[SPEAKER_08]: from horticulture 4940 give their final
oral presentation from their trip to
[SPEAKER_08]: Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a special topics class that's
offered this semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to the generosity of Susan Lynch,
who's been a very generous donor.
[SPEAKER_08]: to the College of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as part of this class, the students
spent their spring break on Easter Island,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is part of Chile.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to talk to us today
about what they need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our class normally meets on Tuesday,
so they couldn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all the students are coming today.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the ones that we're going to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be talking about Santiago,
Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: While constructing our original itinerary
for the trip, we didn't quite plan on
[SPEAKER_01]: spending time in the city of Santiago.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, due to some unexpected issues,
we ended up spending the entirety of our
[SPEAKER_01]: first day and a portion of the second day
within the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, we welcomed the opportunity
and ended up enjoying our time in
[SPEAKER_01]: Santiago.
[SPEAKER_01]: After checking into our hotel,
which was very modernistic and
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable, we set out on foot to find
Los Dominicos, which is an open-air
[SPEAKER_01]: handcraft market that features handmade
artisanal goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we spent a few hours pursuing the
wares and crafts, which included
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from pet parrots to ceramics
and jewelry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Following the time we spent at Los
Dominicos, we all enjoyed a delicious meal
[SPEAKER_01]: spent at a restaurant specializing in
Peruvian cuisine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The following day, before settling out for
Easter Island, we hopped on a
[SPEAKER_01]: double-decker bus and received a tour of
Santiago and learned about its history
[SPEAKER_01]: with the assistant public guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We passed through its many districts and
saw a handful of important sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: which included the Palacio de la Mu√±eca.
[SPEAKER_01]: which serves as the seat of the president.
[SPEAKER_01]: After an informative tour of Santiago,
we headed to the airport and were on our
[SPEAKER_01]: way to Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the village of Montero was like any
other village we've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a few cobblestone roads that led up
to the small beach in town that seems to
[SPEAKER_03]: be at the social center of the island.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were bars and restaurants that lined
the streets where there was open-air
[SPEAKER_03]: seating with always this tropical island
music that you could hear playing when you
[SPEAKER_03]: walked by.
[SPEAKER_03]: We learned that the main mode of
transportation was, they had a lot of cars
[SPEAKER_03]: and trucks, but because of the dirt roads
there, they used a lot of dirt bikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once in a while, you pass on the
street by someone on horseback.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were also granted the company of a lot
of, many dogs walking the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first we thought they were all
straight, but we quickly learned from our
[SPEAKER_03]: tour guide that they're actually,
they're all owned.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just part of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The town also blessed us with a Palm
Sunday mask and song, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Song sung in Rapa Nui, which is their
traditional language.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also a fresh produce market and
plenty of shops and supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, while we were in Easter Island and
Santiago, we got the chance to experience
[SPEAKER_15]: various delicious foods.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, breakfast usually consisted of fresh
fruit, eggs, crepes, here's the omelet
[SPEAKER_15]: that we got to eat, but always fresh fruit
juice.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the meals that we usually had were
very meat heavy, so it was hard to find
[SPEAKER_15]: vegetarian meals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most meals included freshly caught fish
and others included local beef and
[SPEAKER_15]: chicken.
[SPEAKER_15]: The meals also included island grown taro
and sweet potatoes, but the sweet potatoes
[SPEAKER_15]: there actually, what they call sweet
potatoes are actually yams, and they came,
[SPEAKER_15]: they're very prevalent on the island and
came in both orange and purple.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the meals there tended to be a mix
between both Chilean traditional food,
[SPEAKER_15]: but with more seafood and also more
Westernized meals, like we had pizza one
[SPEAKER_15]: night.
[SPEAKER_15]: We all got to try ceviche, which was the
first to remain, and it ended up being
[SPEAKER_15]: really delicious.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Dr. B got to have his favorite
traditional Chilean drink, the pizca sour.
[SPEAKER_15]: But due to the island's remote location
and the high accommodation cost,
[SPEAKER_15]: all food prices were really, really high.
[SPEAKER_15]: But overall, we all really enjoyed the
food and enjoyed the thing I got to
[SPEAKER_15]: experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so we're going to talk a little
bit about what a moai and aqua are.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here you'll see a picture of the moai,
which are the human like figures,
[SPEAKER_16]: which are carved of stone.
[SPEAKER_16]: They are really known to have distinct
hands and long fingernails.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they stand on a platform which is
called an ahu.
[SPEAKER_16]: The ahu are long with wings and they have
stones in front of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: These are primarily used as a way to
worship the ancestors.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people actually actually come in
front of the ahu and sit and gather to
[SPEAKER_16]: have different ceremonies in order to
worship their ancestors.
[SPEAKER_16]: We visited two different ahus.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here you'll see this is Ahutangaruki,
where they actually have 15 standing moai.
[SPEAKER_16]: Another one we went to was Ahutahai.
[SPEAKER_16]: But they didn't have quite as many moai,
and they were as well preserved.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was still a very well established
ahu on the island.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also at Ahutahai, we were able to see this
structure, which was the remnants of an
[SPEAKER_16]: old house, which was actually the way they
had it was just this brown framework with
[SPEAKER_16]: a canoe was actually placed on top of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it was just a very small shelter
that they would just use because they were
[SPEAKER_16]: mainly out for people because of the good
weather.
[SPEAKER_16]: But they would just have this small
shelter that they would use to sleep in.
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of their time was spent outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on our second day, we visited the
volcanic crater Rana Raraku, which is on
[SPEAKER_02]: the side of the quarry where most of the
moai were carved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a special opportunity here to
talk with archaeologists from UCLA who are
[SPEAKER_02]: completing an excavation of some of the
moai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the moai, which you can see right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These statues were carved in any position
that they would kind of fit into the rock
[SPEAKER_02]: using stone tools called toki.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are made of balsalt and obsidian
rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spine was the last.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would carve face up on their backs,
and the spine was the last portion carved
[SPEAKER_02]: and cut away from the rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would be set up in a pit so
that the back of the moai could be carved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often had interesting designs called
petroglyphs in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around 90 moai have been excavated from
the quarry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them were excavated in
non-archaeological conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has made piecing together the
history of the moai much tougher for
[SPEAKER_02]: archaeologists today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had the opportunity to see the
moai in transport down from the quarry in
[SPEAKER_02]: places where they had fallen or broken and
also been placed into the ground and just
[SPEAKER_02]: never taken back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil had spilled around and it had
a very eerie end, which my parents
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't see that clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pudan Pao was another quarry we got to
visit on our documentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the quarry where the top mounts were
made.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top mounts are these, they're almost
like halves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're round, carved out of red storia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different rock than the moai were
carved out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only certain moai got to wear these and it
showed that they were of higher power than
[SPEAKER_03]: the chief.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several theories about how the
top mounts were placed on top of the moai.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the theories is whether or not the
moai were laying down and they kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like tied up with rope on their heads and
then they erected it straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are all theories and we don't
really know exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So during our time at Easter Island,
we got to hide to one of those,
[SPEAKER_07]: or several of the volcanoes, the three
major ones, one of them being 20 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took us roughly 30 minutes to reach the
top of the highest point there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once there, we were amazed by how
isolated we felt looking at the distance.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were basically 1,000 miles of
uninterrupted to largely uninterrupted sea
[SPEAKER_07]: just anywhere you can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we then followed Ramon,
our guide, to the other side of the hills
[SPEAKER_07]: where there were the sites of very early
moai statues.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been determined that these statues
were likely the smallest and that they got
[SPEAKER_07]: larger as time went on, carving larger and
larger statues.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so these moai were likely carved
between the states of 900 and 1118.
[SPEAKER_07]: After this site, we continued on to a cave
made by a lot of people known as the Cave
[SPEAKER_07]: of the Virgins, where the women were once
kept to pale their skin because paleness
[SPEAKER_07]: was a sign of beauty in that culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were kept there for months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we got to crawl in there five at a
time and see if there was a place to
[SPEAKER_07]: crawl.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so we talked about Ranakau.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the larger volcanic craters on
the island.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about 200,000 years old and a mile in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to this day, it's probably one of the
most incredible things I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only is it aesthetically really
pretty, but it's also an enormous source
[SPEAKER_13]: of sustaining the population of Easter
Island with its vast array of plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: In life within the crater, we learned
about limonar.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to talk to us a lot about the
biodiversity that is in the crater.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's medicinal fern that lives within
the crater that is used to treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: There has also been analysis of the mud,
water composition that has been determined
[SPEAKER_13]: to stop the growth of DNA and producing
the vulnerability of life, which,
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we can kind of say that instead of
maybe like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as well as recently, there have been
studies that have served as the origin of
[SPEAKER_13]: the medicine procedures, which,
as Ramona told us, the Rapa Nui people get
[SPEAKER_13]: VIP access to each other.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a cool hero is the fertility stone that
the ancient Rapa Nui people have played to
[SPEAKER_14]: promote fertility among these people.
[SPEAKER_14]: The noise made by the fertility stone
resembles a conch shell.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fertility petroglyphs are carved into the
stone all over its surface.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're showing the significance of
fertility in their culture.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ramona taught us how to play the stone,
which can be quite the task.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can either cut one end to the other
side of that hole and hit it to make the
[SPEAKER_14]: sound, or you can blow into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a few of us gave it a try, and only
Joy's here was successful in getting it
[SPEAKER_14]: out.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are also bugs crawling in another
bit, which also made it a little
[SPEAKER_14]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_14]: So our next stop this day was to enable
the world, and this is a stone that is
[SPEAKER_14]: said to have been carried to the island by
its first king, Hotu Matua.
[SPEAKER_14]: Having to travel thousands of miles across
the Pacific with this large stone proved
[SPEAKER_14]: its meaning to the Rapa Nui people.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is said to possess heavy doses of mana,
the spiritual power bestowed by the gods.
[SPEAKER_14]: So taking one chance on the stone,
mana will bring them health and energy.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all got the chance to touch the stone
before leaving the site in hopes that we
[SPEAKER_14]: would absorb some of its energy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to talk about moving circling
and tell you guys a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_13]: Birdman Colt.
[SPEAKER_13]: So on our first day, the island we
visited, Random Cat, which I talked about
[SPEAKER_13]: before, and Arongo.
[SPEAKER_13]: And back in history, historically,
Arongo used to be the center of the
[SPEAKER_13]: village.
[SPEAKER_13]: And during the Birdman Colt era,
which is when basically you had rivaling
[SPEAKER_13]: tribes, higher clans, and they each year
would competition where young boys would
[SPEAKER_13]: compete.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they would swim out to the islands,
which are shown in the picture.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they would swim out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the person who collects an egg and
gets back up the mountain first is the one
[SPEAKER_13]: who would win.
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically, the egg had to be intact.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also spent some time on the
islands.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they got there meditating and getting
touched spiritually.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: We learned about that from up there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then later in the week, we had a
chance to go out on a boat and see the
[SPEAKER_13]: islands up close.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: The water was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the brightest blue indigo you'll
ever see.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was just amazing to see that people
had to swim out there and actually come
[SPEAKER_13]: back and skip.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't see it here, but you've probably
seen that picture.
[SPEAKER_13]: That the mountainside is pretty steep.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it must have been really difficult to
scale, trying to keep an egg intact.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of times, our tour guide,
Ramon, said that people could have put it
[SPEAKER_13]: in their mouths and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it was a really rainy day when we
did this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Ramon was in goal.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was responsible.
[SPEAKER_13]: He had opportunities to be all about the
circling.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was interesting to see because
there weren't a lot of fish or anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was really not your typical
circling experience because there wasn't
[SPEAKER_13]: that much coral life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or anything in the sea very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: We saw probably three fish.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was awesome, nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the way back, we saw, at that
point, multiple rainbows breaking the ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Much of our time was spent learning about
the blue flora at the Botanical Garden of
[SPEAKER_10]: Kana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kana is extremely active in conservation
of fire diversity and involving the local
[SPEAKER_10]: community in their efforts.
[SPEAKER_10]: They grow a lot of endemic and medicinal
plants in their nursery and distribute
[SPEAKER_10]: them to the locals.
[SPEAKER_10]: And last year, they gave out 30,000 plants
to the Rapa Nui people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Kana is currently involved in
attempting to reintroduce and plant more
[SPEAKER_10]: endemic or endangered plants back to their
Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, they are reintroducing the
sulfur tarp-grown vial trees, which are
[SPEAKER_10]: endemic to Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have a display of the
traditional Rapa Nui agricultural methods,
[SPEAKER_10]: like the moong man of mine, which are
stone structures built around the plants
[SPEAKER_10]: to protect them from livestock and wind or
storm water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're creating the micropinics to
provide an optimum moisture and
[SPEAKER_10]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we got to visit the hospital on Rapa
Nui.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Easter Island has a long tradition
of using herbal medicines, many islanders
[SPEAKER_14]: have wanted them to be used in the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_14]: So as a compromise, there is a special
room attached to the hospital with a
[SPEAKER_14]: separate entrance.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this allowed patients to have a choice
of choosing traditional or accidental
[SPEAKER_14]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were able to tour the facilities
and talk with Kamala Huck, the president
[SPEAKER_14]: of the board of Rapa Nui.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she told us that herbal treatments are
the only one aspect of their holistic
[SPEAKER_14]: approach to healing, which treats the
entire mind and body of the patient.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kamala works with three other islanders,
in addition to visiting physicians and the
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew College of Students.
[SPEAKER_14]: In order to stretch the very limited
budget of the traditional medicine
[SPEAKER_14]: program, Kamala is now using a radio show
to help the Rapa Nui people learn how to
[SPEAKER_14]: grow and use medicinal plants at home.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the artisan market was one of the last
stops of being on Rapa Nui.
[SPEAKER_12]: So towards the end of our trip,
we went to the artisan market down the
[SPEAKER_12]: road from our hotel.
[SPEAKER_12]: Essentially, it's kind of a new shop of
our experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were able to grab a couple of
souvenirs there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was plenty of handcrafted
souvenirs and herbal medicine,
[SPEAKER_12]: stone, and wood.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just really awesome,
the traditional crafts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of our classmates, Liz,
was able to purchase a handcrafted wood
[SPEAKER_12]: structure that she actually saw the woman
doing at the site.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: So after one of our last dinners together
on the island, we headed to Karikari,
[SPEAKER_14]: a local performance held in the town that
draws in both native and foreign people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when the instrumental section of this
act came out, there were a lot of drummers
[SPEAKER_14]: and guitarists and auxiliary
percussionists.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were immediately impressed with their
talent and energy expressed through the
[SPEAKER_14]: music.
[SPEAKER_14]: Next, the dancers and singers filled the
stage with their traditional song and
[SPEAKER_14]: dance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I can't leave out the most exciting
part of the night.
[SPEAKER_14]: As a part of the Karikari show,
the performers went to the crowd and chose
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of people to get up on stage.
[SPEAKER_14]: So several of us, including myself,
got the exhilarating opportunity to
[SPEAKER_14]: express ourselves revenue style.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of us could be quite the star.
[SPEAKER_14]: She fit right in with the vibrant and
artful culture here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So after seeing the Karikari ballet,
it seemed very apparent that they probably
[SPEAKER_14]: performed this in order to keep the
traditional rep and unique culture alive
[SPEAKER_14]: through its younger people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems as though it serves as an
educational tool by exposing spectators to
[SPEAKER_14]: their cultural song, dance, and music.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so Onukkona Beach is the beach
on Eastern Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is said to be the landing place of
Polynesian chief and settlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these settlers created the first
settlements on Rapa Nui.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going up to the beach, Ramon told us of a
tsunami that hit the island previously and
[SPEAKER_01]: wiped out 95% of the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we saw there was what was left,
and it still looks like a gorgeous beach
[SPEAKER_01]: that people want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's currently home to two abus,
as we learned of earlier, one of which is
[SPEAKER_01]: currently under construction, and other
homes, six moai extensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this was a particularly significant
day for myself because it was my first
[SPEAKER_01]: time stepping foot into an ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get out much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water was a deep, deep blue,
very salty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all loving life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. D was floating off into the distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a traditional cocktail.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a pottery grill off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_15]: On our last day, we had the opportunity to
check to the top of Maungatara Vaka via
[SPEAKER_15]: horseback.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maungatara Vaka is the highest point on
Eastern Island at 507 meters.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this was our only opportunity to get to
the top, so we're very excited.
[SPEAKER_15]: The views were incredible the entire way
up, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we got to the top, we all jumped
off our horses and left them at a
[SPEAKER_15]: water-cold degrees, and we all walked to
the, it wasn't very far, but to the very
[SPEAKER_15]: top.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when we were at the top,
we got to take even more incredible
[SPEAKER_15]: pictures, and we could see the curvature
of the earth on the horizon, because you
[SPEAKER_15]: can see so much of the ocean around you,
which was really incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: On our way back down, we got to see even
more great views of Hangarua and the ocean
[SPEAKER_15]: around us, and the weather held out
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a beautiful sunny day.
[SPEAKER_15]: We all got plenty sunburned.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just right as we were getting back to
the ranch, it started to drizzle a little,
[SPEAKER_15]: which actually was welcome after the hot
day and the sun.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this was actually the high point of my
trip, and I think everyone agrees that it
[SPEAKER_15]: was a well-worthwhile trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm Richard Childers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of an effective translator for
the trip, being the most fluent in
[SPEAKER_07]: Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we're here in the States,
we never really worry about whether or not
[SPEAKER_07]: the guy at Starbucks is going to be able
to understand our Volante order,
[SPEAKER_07]: as nice simply given, we'll be able to
communicate, to express ourselves in what
[SPEAKER_07]: we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a fluent Spanish speaker who took the
lazy route and only really traveled abroad
[SPEAKER_07]: in South America, it's sometimes difficult
for me to understand this concept of not
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to express myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had the pleasure to put my thoughts
into use during our trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: And although there were times I forgot
what language I was speaking and to whom,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's a flurry of questions, I never had
to deal with the concept of not being able
[SPEAKER_07]: to get my point across.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just not being able to pull the
waiter aside and ask if this strange sauce
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen before has shellfish,
or if the empanadas are vegan or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So although I tried to find answers for as
many questions as I could, especially in
[SPEAKER_07]: the old times, which are kind of creepy,
I know it must have been a hassle for you
[SPEAKER_07]: to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I also know that there are a bit of
culture that one misses out on in such
[SPEAKER_07]: cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were times when locals would crack
little jokes or tell stories about maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: the only one chuggling, so I just re-burnt
the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe me, if retelling a joke lessens
the humor, translating it makes it 10
[SPEAKER_07]: times worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was no exception.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank all of you who laughed
anyhow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if I didn't make it more
understandable for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess in general I'd like to
recognize my fellow group members.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both for their patience and flexibility,
and for their dedication to going and
[SPEAKER_07]: learning and having fun, no matter what
the language barriers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that through my translation I
kind of ease some of these difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in the part of the presentation
where we talk about the many research
[SPEAKER_02]: projects that different groups of students
on the trip developed and distributed
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the trip, the project group
that I was in charge of was a sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant identification scavenger hunt in
which we looked at the biodiversity on
[SPEAKER_02]: islands by comparing what species we
thought would be there from looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: finding species names in books and on the
internet that were connected with Easter
[SPEAKER_02]: Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before the trip we were able to find
130 large species names specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: But finding a total species number was
quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came up with 212 from a few
different sources online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a number that was challenging
to find because often the number 47 would
[SPEAKER_02]: be mentioned as the number of native
higher plant species on the island,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fairly small species count gave us
the idea that the biodiversity of the
[SPEAKER_02]: island would be very low and that it would
be fairly thin and desolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: However upon arriving we discovered that
this was not exactly the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much of the island is covered in rolling
grass vistas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would know it from the large
variety of trees, mango, avocado,
[SPEAKER_07]: palm, china berry, eucalyptus,
beautiful cultivated tropical flowers and
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, general lush vegetation of the
island's only town, Angaroa.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were lucky enough to visit our tour
guide's house for lunch and explore his
[SPEAKER_07]: extensive and frankly overwhelming gardens
which contain many classic tropical plants
[SPEAKER_07]: that are found across the globe which we
hadn't included previously on our list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall we photographed 101 more species
than the original 131 and we're also able
[SPEAKER_07]: to find and photograph many of those as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: The two methods for obtaining our species
counts were combined allowing us to
[SPEAKER_07]: account for 232 species on the island,
20 more than the number of 212 that we
[SPEAKER_07]: previously documented.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the trip we all, everyone in our
room, was reflected on the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: biodiversity on the island and we came up
with some interesting conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The species count is low especially even
in comparison to our local in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: In many ways this actually provided a
greater experience of the concept of
[SPEAKER_02]: biodiversity because we were able to
understand the vastness and subtlety of
[SPEAKER_02]: difference within the kingdom plantae on a
comprehensible scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if only 232 species we learned about
an experience firsthand of harmful
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal, delicious, and fascinating
plants found all across the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw grasses that made horses ill,
plants that treat cancer, and enjoyed
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh mangoes off of a tree just steps
away from our hotel on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prevalence of food crops was
especially notable in terms of people's
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to create their own sustainable
paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biodiversity was also emphasized by
the hotspot that Alexa mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rano Cow, in which almost all the plants
on the island grow and some plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are found nowhere else on the island grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like most people haven't considered
this term, the only need to find
[SPEAKER_07]: biodiversity is the diversity of plant
animal life, especially as represented by
[SPEAKER_07]: the number of extant species.
[SPEAKER_07]: We discovered that this term is both
nuanced and complicated and carries
[SPEAKER_07]: numerous implications and it's important
to consider in the context of specific
[SPEAKER_07]: places.
[SPEAKER_07]: Simply counting species numbers skews
one's perspective of a place and of their
[SPEAKER_07]: perception of ecosystem sustainability and
value.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it also is a fatalistic perspective
for a place like Easter Island and fails
[SPEAKER_07]: to consider that the people, like the Rapa
Nui, can restore the biodiversity of their
[SPEAKER_07]: environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: By attempting to document biodiversity in
a stereotypical way, we ended up
[SPEAKER_07]: discovering that this concept is much
harder to nail down than once we thought
[SPEAKER_07]: and that it means more than just a number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are some pictures of plants that
we found, both native and a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more typical.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Alexa.
[SPEAKER_13]: Me and Maddie kind of took charge of this
group.
[SPEAKER_13]: We came up with the idea of transects and
again helped us out with taking transects
[SPEAKER_13]: in the island.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we kind of did something similar to
Alyssa's group, but we kind of tried to
[SPEAKER_13]: make it a little bit more quantitative,
as much as we can considering we kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: limited transects.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we decided to do, the objective of our
play of biodiversity was to assess the
[SPEAKER_13]: composition of plant species throughout
Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on our data.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so given the history of the
deforestation on Easter Island and the
[SPEAKER_13]: depletion of the native pit flora,
it was a big question in our minds as to
[SPEAKER_13]: like, okay, what species are there and
what is their spread like on the island?
[SPEAKER_13]: So our goal is to obtain a quantitative
analysis of the species that we see at
[SPEAKER_13]: various locations on the island by
calculating the percentage of abundance of
[SPEAKER_13]: each species reported at each site.
[SPEAKER_13]: So prior to departure, our group and
Alyssa's group kind of worked together to
[SPEAKER_13]: compile a plant species ID booklet off the
internet and like getting pictures off the
[SPEAKER_13]: internet that we could
[SPEAKER_13]: then take transects at each spot,
as many spots as we could that we visited.
[SPEAKER_13]: And our transect was eight meters in
length and we did four meter plots,
[SPEAKER_13]: four meter, no, four one meter plots to
transect and photograph each species that
[SPEAKER_13]: we found on the transect.
[SPEAKER_15]: So our poster in the hallway shows a
figure with the species compositions that
[SPEAKER_15]: we found.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we found that there was a range of
abundances and varieties of different
[SPEAKER_15]: species at each site.
[SPEAKER_15]: Each, all sites though had a large number
of varying species of grass.
[SPEAKER_15]: And speculation says that this grassland
landscape has existed on the island since
[SPEAKER_15]: the natives over-harvested the trees for
timber and overused slash and burn on
[SPEAKER_15]: agriculture techniques to feed the
overpopulation in the 15th century.
[SPEAKER_15]: The peak of this populous was recorded
between 7,000 and 10,000 and evidence on
[SPEAKER_15]: the island.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's controversial, however,
whether or not this directly related in
[SPEAKER_15]: the deforestation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Regardless, deforestation did lead to the
dwindling and extinction of various
[SPEAKER_15]: original native species.
[SPEAKER_15]: An example of this being the native palm
tree, which was harvested for lumber and
[SPEAKER_15]: all the nuts were eaten by both humans and
rats that were brought to the island.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a result, it was eliminated as a
species.
[SPEAKER_15]: When comparing the results of the various
sites, you can see the difference in
[SPEAKER_15]: native versus invasive between CONAPF and
the other sites quite obviously.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is due to CONAPF's restoration
project for the native plants of Easter
[SPEAKER_15]: Island.
[SPEAKER_15]: So within their borders, they contain much
less invasive species, but outside of
[SPEAKER_15]: their control was quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the establishment of invasive species
especially facilitated in the areas where
[SPEAKER_15]: there is no restoration of projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the future, increased number and size
of transects in more locations would
[SPEAKER_15]: probably be needed to get an accurate
biodiversity assay of the island.
[SPEAKER_15]: An investigation into why each site was
composed of different species,
[SPEAKER_15]: but also be really interesting and could
be done by a more comprehensive composite
[SPEAKER_15]: plant composition species throughout the
island.
[SPEAKER_15]: And studies of the various microclimates
and histories on topography of the land.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will be presenting Matthew Bond's
research objectives and findings.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be here for the presentation,
but he will be here after.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the goal of Matthew's research project
was to conduct a survey of the plant's use
[SPEAKER_14]: in revenue and medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Approximately 80% of the world's
population relies primarily on natural
[SPEAKER_14]: health products as sources of medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: This occurs even in areas where western
biomedicine is available due to easier
[SPEAKER_14]: access, cultural preference, and lower
cost.
[SPEAKER_14]: Easter Island is an ideal location to
survey medicinal plants because the use of
[SPEAKER_14]: herbal medicines is a strong part of their
culture.
[SPEAKER_14]: This island hospital even includes an
attached clinic where traditional
[SPEAKER_14]: medicines are administered like discussed
before.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because very few books and articles have
been written about the revenue and
[SPEAKER_14]: ethnobotany, most information was gained
by interviewing four of the islanders who
[SPEAKER_14]: are showing us archaeological sites.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ramon, our tour guide, also helped us out
with this.
[SPEAKER_14]: He grew up on the island and used many
medicinal plants regularly, such as a
[SPEAKER_14]: mixture of ginger root and sugar cane,
which was taken for coughs and stomach
[SPEAKER_14]: cramps.
[SPEAKER_14]: While Ramon grew up on the island,
he also pointed out plants like castor
[SPEAKER_14]: bean growing along the road, which can be
used to ease joint pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of Ramon's friends had even spent
several years being treated at the
[SPEAKER_14]: hospital with very little effect,
and after being switched to using castor
[SPEAKER_14]: bean instead of contemporary medicine,
her condition rapidly improved.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_14]: Another important source of ethnobotanical
information was George, the growing
[SPEAKER_14]: manager of Kona.
[SPEAKER_14]: He described several important medicinal
species.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of these is Kaonakonako, a plant in
the nightshade family which produces a
[SPEAKER_14]: small tomato-like berry.
[SPEAKER_14]: This fruit is very nutritious and is eaten
to treat rashes and stomach ailments.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the most interesting plants we saw
was Matua Pua, a fern that has shown high
[SPEAKER_14]: potential in tests as an anti-cancer drug.
[SPEAKER_14]: The islanders drank a tea made from its
roots to treat fractures, sprains,
[SPEAKER_14]: menstrual cramps, burns, and bruises.
[SPEAKER_14]: The person we met with the most knowledge
of herbal medicine was Pamela Huck from
[SPEAKER_14]: the traditional side of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_14]: She grows dozens of plants at her house on
Kona property and other locations on the
[SPEAKER_14]: island used for treating patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: This project identified a total of 23
medicinal plants representing 20 different
[SPEAKER_14]: families.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, this is most likely only a
fraction of all the plants used on Easter
[SPEAKER_14]: Island.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of the use of herbal treatments on
the island, it's still alive and well both
[SPEAKER_14]: at the hospital and in daily living.
[SPEAKER_14]: Easter Island provided an ideal location
to study not only the patients,
[SPEAKER_14]: but the context of how they're integrated
into recovery culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so many of us being from horse
backgrounds thought it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to study horses and the
biodiversity effects on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Elizabeth, Jay, and myself headed up
this research group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned that earlier in the history on
Easter Island, horses were consumed as a
[SPEAKER_01]: source of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that biodiversity is on its way
upward and resources are more readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available, the horse meat is no longer
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the word overpopulation of
horses, many of the natives would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the consumption of horses promoted
once again to control the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently on the island, there are 5,000
horses and 5,800 people, so it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: about a one-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking to the researchers at Kona,
they said that ideally they'd like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: two to four hectares per horse on the
island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the island is 160 hectares,
square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when doing the math, you would need 100
to 200 square kilometers of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are dealing with space issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: When talking to Kona, their goal is to
reintroduce the native species and various
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants to the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're facing many issues with horses
as far as keeping those plants alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're often building barriers around
the plants, shrubbery, whatnot,
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep the horses out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go back to the previous
picture, they're trying to keep the horses
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the moai statues.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moai, the horses are using the abus
and the moai as a scratching post.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually eroding away the
statues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put in these turnstiles that
ideally only humans are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are horses on the other side,
and they aren't grazing directly in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of the moai.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing what they can to keep them
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason, can you go back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those bulls, or bulls, or gopher
bulls, or something else even?
[SPEAKER_01]: These here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are rocks, OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and also, the horses, they're all
owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 5,000 horses on the island,
they're all owned by someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're roaming free, and they mostly
take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll always see a brand on them,
as you can find in their owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often, horses are seen as a status
symbol on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more horses you have, the higher you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some natives would like to see a role
put in the fact that limits occurs into
[SPEAKER_01]: how many horses they can own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often, you'll see islanders utilizing
that as transportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you'll see so much now as you
did in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my group, or our research group,
for Yantung, Caitlin, and I, was to
[SPEAKER_12]: investigate food crops on Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_12]: So our group was to investigate the food
crops on the island.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also were interested in the climate
and irrigation systems of the island.
[SPEAKER_12]: The methods we used to collect our data
was, through resources, through observing
[SPEAKER_12]: at restaurants and menus, and seeing what
ingredients were often on the menus,
[SPEAKER_12]: through observations at farms that we had
visited, and family farms and gardens,
[SPEAKER_12]: and also at the local food markets.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could see what was imported and what
was locally grown.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the results that we found was that
there was definitely a consistent group of
[SPEAKER_12]: crops that were consumed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, highly grown on the island,
such include taroes, sweet potato,
[SPEAKER_12]: banana, mango, guava.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we found those as consistent stables
in our meals.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, we saw them growing in the
field, obviously.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Museum Day Anthropological Sebastian
and Edward, which is a museum on Easter
[SPEAKER_12]: Island, recognized 14 crops as the most
important crops on Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of which are food crops, and some of
which are ethno-mechanically important and
[SPEAKER_12]: medicinal important.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of our meals consisted of,
for breakfast, guava, mango, and bananas,
[SPEAKER_12]: as Maddie had shown earlier.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for lunch, we had mostly sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_12]: And our ingredients were mostly tomato and
cheese.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my speculation is that the cheese is
imported.
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't see cattle, per se, or not at
least in abundance enough to produce food.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for dinner, mostly we had a side of
fish with a side of sweet potato for
[SPEAKER_12]: mashed or chips.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they had a variety of seafood on the
island, consisting of tuna
[SPEAKER_12]: and lobster.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so an observation that I just wanted
to point out is that the size of the fruit
[SPEAKER_12]: was obviously different for me,
at least.
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, the pineapples were about
seven to eight inches tall, whereas my mom
[SPEAKER_12]: can sometimes bite pineapples that are
huge.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in contrast, the watermelon was
relatively large compared to the
[SPEAKER_12]: watermelon that we eat in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thought that was another subject
matter to be investigated in the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of the marketplace, where we also
collected some of our data and pictures,
[SPEAKER_12]: we found various other crops such as
cabbage, basil, cilantro, chives,
[SPEAKER_12]: pumpkin, and cucumber, garlic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of which are imported, and some of
which are grown on the island.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another major source for us, for our
information with Ramon, are Tordai,
[SPEAKER_12]: which we had discussed previously a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's done a really great help to us in our
project.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he gives a tour of his garden at home,
where he grows pretty much all of the
[SPEAKER_12]: crops that I've mentioned previously,
and discusses with us how he vegetatively
[SPEAKER_12]: propagates bananas, every night months.
[SPEAKER_12]: And how he cuts back the shoot after it
fruits, and new baby shoots emerge from
[SPEAKER_12]: the ground, and it's really great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And some practices that are unique to Star
Island is, with their incorporation of
[SPEAKER_12]: their culture and their agricultural
practices, is planting cuttings,
[SPEAKER_12]: plant cuttings during the new moon,
and planting seeds during full moon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, there is a prevalence of male
farmers, because women are traditionally
[SPEAKER_12]: not supposed to be farming when they're on
their menstruation cycle, so there's
[SPEAKER_12]: mostly male farmers for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_12]: And another traditional practice for
agriculture is to have the planify,
[SPEAKER_12]: which are the stone structures surrounding
the trees, which Ramon had discussed,
[SPEAKER_12]: which are used to pretty much promote the
optimum temperature in the plant structure
[SPEAKER_12]: by preventing livestock from grazing on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason you might need to hold
moisture in these plants while you plant
[SPEAKER_03]: the planify, is because Easter Island
typically has a very hot tropical climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their hottest season is typically what our
winter would be, and it's their driest
[SPEAKER_03]: season, where they can receive an average
of two to four inches per month,
[SPEAKER_03]: which really isn't that much water if
you're at 85 plus degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not dropping below 60 at
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the soil there is also very dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weathered basalt soil that's high
in pH, finely textured porous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having this dark, rich, iron soil gets
really hot really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't hold in the moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: These will overwater it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the picture with pediatric
irrigation, it kind of makes sense that
[SPEAKER_03]: they would have that just because you can
see how dark the soil is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see posters from all of these
presentations out in the hall and talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: us if you were involved with them
afterward if you have any more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in conclusion, I just wanted to talk
about just throughout my time at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_02]: the importance of hand-on interactions for
sparking curiosity and promoting
[SPEAKER_02]: excitement has been reiterated again and
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This class followed above and beyond that
trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only so much literature research,
writing papers, and attempting to memorize
[SPEAKER_02]: information that you can do to try to
learn about something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real learning and education begins
when you take this academic-based inquiry
[SPEAKER_02]: and connect it to a place through
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: When visiting a place for an academic
trip, there's a tendency to avoid certain
[SPEAKER_02]: activities because they aren't educational
or too touristy, which can actually limit
[SPEAKER_02]: the experience's educational potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So reflecting back on the trip,
I can think of many new experiences
[SPEAKER_02]: traveling with a large group, being with
one person to communicate with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people for a week, and going out on a boat
on the open ocean and riding on a horse
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really enhanced and clarified many
things that I've learned about in school
[SPEAKER_02]: just throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have better communication and
teamwork skills and patience, desire to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn my Spanish a lot better,
wonder why the ocean is so clear and what
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of organisms were on those rocks 15
meters below us when we were struggling,
[SPEAKER_02]: and understand in a way that only writing
can show you what it was like to travel
[SPEAKER_02]: around before there were cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: This knowledge of place and activity
combined with three years' lines and
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to reflect on and contemplate our
experiences were traits that I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: exemplified and taken advantage of by
everyone in this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this provided an outstanding
opportunity for learning and experience
[SPEAKER_02]: that I and everyone who went I'm glad to
have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we take some questions,
I forgot to introduce the co-instructor of
[SPEAKER_08]: the class, Dr. Betsy Lamb.
[SPEAKER_08]: So since I work on Long Island,
I have to participate in this class.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's long distance by video cam,
but Betsy is here every week in the class.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she does the majority of the work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank her for her help on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: She joined us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any questions for the
students?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see any reptiles or amphibians on
the island?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any?
[SPEAKER_15]: There was lizards in our room.
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, I don't think it's that
much.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lizards.
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't look into it specifically.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, the general lizards.
[SPEAKER_16]: But nothing really large.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was surprised on many of our hikes not
to see snakes.
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like that's something that I might
expect to see kind of hiking.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was really the process.
[SPEAKER_11]: In his book, Collapse, which I recommend
for all of you, Jared Diamond posited the
[SPEAKER_11]: question with regards to the fact the
island was totally deforested at one
[SPEAKER_11]: point.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did the person think who cut down the
last tree?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think there ever was an ending to
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Ramon at least talked about
everyone's very sustainable on the island.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or at least they're all food.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think at least there had to be
bananas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there reforestation going on on the
island at present?
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to bring in, actually right
now, the Chilean palm.
[SPEAKER_16]: And CONAC believes that it's the most
similar relative to the palms which are
[SPEAKER_16]: originally on the island.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they think that because of the
similar climate and the similarities in
[SPEAKER_16]: the two palms, they think that it'll be
the most fun able to sustain life on the
[SPEAKER_16]: island.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is a great effort from CONAC
right now to do that comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: You showed lots of examples of people
gardening and producing their own food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think they had to import a lot of
produce as well?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you think they basically produced
the animal of the island's needs?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think from the sense that we got it,
it's more they can produce for themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the reason why it's so hard for us is
it's hard to sustain for a larger than
[SPEAKER_13]: their own population.
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially now that they become such a
tourist population, that they have such a
[SPEAKER_16]: large amount of people that are coming to
the island just for touristing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think that a lot of the small
personal farms, like our tour guide Ramon,
[SPEAKER_16]: he had a tree of each species kind of.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that wouldn't be something
that he could really have enough to profit
[SPEAKER_16]: and sell to the market.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramon really talked a lot about how
personal sustainable they can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to add, the farms we visited,
you generally see one greenhouse structure
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe a one to two acre pot of Harlem
with vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small scale.
[SPEAKER_16]: And also the great part of that is that
the island in general, the focus of it,
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe, is protected by CONAC.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they have the small town Pumbra.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the only region with a really small
area of the island which is even allowed
[SPEAKER_16]: to be farmed.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's just an average area that you
can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real simple question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is the island?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the distances?
[SPEAKER_01]: 168 square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seven miles by 14 miles of altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on where you take the dimensions
from, it's this kind of triangle shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half the size of Grand Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have naive assumptions as far as what we
need to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That the way that the statues got glorious
is wherever they ended up was well,
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of unknown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the people that you talked to live on
the island?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have a opinion about that?
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that when we went to the museum
specifically, there was a few different
[SPEAKER_16]: things that had a couple different
theories that kind of evolved from
[SPEAKER_16]: different archaeologists that had been on
the island at the time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, the archaeologist during his
homework we talked to from UCLA who was
[SPEAKER_16]: there at the time, they all had different
theories.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some that currently go from them
rolling them on logs that the logs will
[SPEAKER_16]: roll them.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's different theories where they'll
walk them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Teeter.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of different theories.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it really depends on who you talk to.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they haven't really assessed one
as being correct.
[SPEAKER_16]: They just kind of have all those theories
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a study not too long ago where
they tried the theory of placing the moai
[SPEAKER_01]: on a skid and then having the logs roll
the skid, keep placing the logs in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of the skid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got very effective results.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got hundreds of feet not too long
ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a TV program not long ago that
showed the walking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, the teetering.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the interesting thing, of course,
is that it's not flat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking the volcanic quarry down and
then to the coastline.
[SPEAKER_16]: When they followed us theories like that,
and we're standing on this large hill they
[SPEAKER_16]: call a quarry, and we're saying,
you want us to take this moai here all the
[SPEAKER_16]: way over there, and you're going to walk
it?
[SPEAKER_16]: It just was so applicable to us at that
point.
[SPEAKER_16]: Personally, I think a lot of the other
methods seemed more reasonable,
[SPEAKER_16]: but there's definitely some a lot of
support for those theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest they were able to transport
was 30 feet high and 50 tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're able to transport,
the largest ever car was 60 feet high,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it still remains in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the world tradition though,
there is support for the theory that the
[SPEAKER_02]: moai walked, because that is part of their
world tradition is the idea that they say
[SPEAKER_02]: the moai walked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they don't know how, but part of
their world tradition is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, and I did read one study which
actually looked at a lot of the transport
[SPEAKER_02]: roads, and all of them had at least a
slight downhill grade to the location of
[SPEAKER_02]: the moai.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as impossible as it seemed to us,
that is a plausible theory.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's a bit more romanticized
than flipping the moai on their stomachs
[SPEAKER_07]: and rolling them on the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite was the one that said they
shot them out of the volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the aliens movement.
[SPEAKER_16]: They said that people would actually hide
out because they were actually,
if they didn't hide out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were they dependent on those palm trees
for food?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they used the palm trees to like,
they would cut canoes out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were dependent, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they used it for tools and stuff like
wood spears and stuff like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they called it, they were,
we could go to like the nearby island and
[SPEAKER_16]: style it just to keep it because only if
people wanted to customize the way our
[SPEAKER_16]: place was.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they did.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that was the closest.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they did, at once when they were able
to go, they just could transfer to another
[SPEAKER_16]: island.
[SPEAKER_16]: And without that, they were completely
isolated on the island.
[SPEAKER_16]: They had no way to evolve without the
resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much.
