[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, you know, at this point I've
given quite a few seminars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was by far my favorite introduction
I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like goosebumps right now,
so that feels really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna take the opportunity to invite
anybody who wants to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to feel no pressure,
but to turn on your video just so I can
[SPEAKER_02]: have something to engage with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a whole screen of names right now,
many of which are familiar, but many who
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in a place where you want me
to see your reactions to the research I
[SPEAKER_02]: present, absolutely turn your videos on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so today I'm going to tell you guys,
as Chelsea alluded to, all about the
[SPEAKER_02]: research I've done on neotropical plant
evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I dive into the Andes, I'm going to
paint a picture of the neotropics writ
[SPEAKER_02]: large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the neotropics are the region of
the world between the tropics of Cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: and Capricorn in the Western Hemisphere,
stretching from southern Mexico in the
[SPEAKER_02]: north and Chiapas and through northern
Argentina in the south, wrapping around to
[SPEAKER_02]: include the Caribbean islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for biodiversity, they're an
incredibly important part of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are between 90 and 110,000 species
of vascular plants that are native to the
[SPEAKER_02]: neotropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to put this into a broader global
context, this means that the neotropics
[SPEAKER_02]: may hold more plant species than the
entirety of the African and Asian tropics
[SPEAKER_02]: combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really quite stunning levels of
neotropical diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I'm in a plant biology
department, I know you guys know a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants from this region, but here are
some of the plants that are probably more
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar to you, but also maybe to the
people who aren't plant biologists in your
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of charismatic tropical fruits
like papayas and pineapples, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen staples like potatoes and chilies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the neotropics is as many of the sort
of uncontroversially wonderful plants it
[SPEAKER_02]: has.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have some more controversial ones
as well, including the coca leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is so important for the medical
industry, but is also quite infamous for
[SPEAKER_02]: the drug trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a botanist, when I think of the
neotropics, this is more like the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity that I think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neotropics are home to almost all
species of cacti, bromeliads, and of
[SPEAKER_02]: course, the heliconias that I wet my teeth
on as an undergrad in Tulsi's lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in plants that might be less familiar
as well, including things like this big
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf gunnera, this formerly topobaea and
albalachia species being pollinated by an
[SPEAKER_02]: orchid bee, and many, many species of the
primarily tropical order malpigaea leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: including this antodiscus species here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a major question that drives my
research, but also plenty of other folks'
[SPEAKER_02]: research, including, I think, people in
your department who are coming at it from
[SPEAKER_02]: a totally different angle than me,
is what explains this neotropical
[SPEAKER_02]: hyperdiversity?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, of course, abiotic explanations
that include simply time and area,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the neotropics are both big and old,
but also climate and aspects of the
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape themselves, including hydrology
and mountain uplift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And prominently today, my talk will
feature Andean uplift.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are plenty of biotic factors as
well that may underlie diversification,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant diversification in this region,
including things a little bit inherent to
[SPEAKER_02]: the species like potential to hybridize or
deform polypoids, also adaptations to soil
[SPEAKER_02]: environments and other parts of the
abiotic niche, and of course, biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions, whether they're mutualisms
with pollinators or seed dispersers or
[SPEAKER_02]: antagonisms like the relationship between
plants and their herbivores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know my research, you know I'm
sort of stuck on one of these biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: mutualisms, hummingbird pollination,
and I think this is a really good example
[SPEAKER_02]: of how the neotropics have just such
fantastic biological interactions ongoing
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout their entire landscape,
and so many plants have converged to take
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of this particular pollinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get at what drives neotropical
plant evolution, my research program takes
[SPEAKER_02]: a clade-focused approach, but is very
integrative across subclades of biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially of evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I integrate macroevolutionary studies
with microevolution with species ecology,
[SPEAKER_02]: my research program sort of at that happy
zone right there in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But importantly, my research is always
conducted in a systematic context.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding phylogenetic
relationships, as well as having a solid
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of alpha taxonomy,
underlies all the research that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this of course means that herbarium
specimens are central to the work that I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the data I will present to you
today came either in part or in whole from
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium specimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're just such an important
source of data for the evolutionary
[SPEAKER_02]: biologists, in addition to being an
important place for a taxonomist to really
[SPEAKER_02]: get to understand a group in its
complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my research program, now that I
have my own lab at LSU, takes a
[SPEAKER_02]: two-pronged approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first prong is to go really deep into a
single model clade to try to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: the evolutionary processes that give rise
to Andean biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I use the neotropical
bellflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will be the most of my talk
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also a second prong in which I
am trying to understand taxonomy,
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogeny, and evolution of groups that
are totally understudied.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neotropics, for being a species rich
and rich in their interactions as they
[SPEAKER_02]: are, are surprisingly understudied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a phylogenetic perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to hop in and tell you a
little bit about that first prong right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neotropical bellflowers are what I
consider emerging model clade to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand Andean plant evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: They comprise about 600 species total
across three different subgroups.
[SPEAKER_02]: The core genera that I'll spend most of my
time talking about today are centropogon,
[SPEAKER_02]: burmeistera, and syphocampalus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collectively, these genera are sister to a
group of high elevation endemic taxa in
[SPEAKER_02]: the genus Lysaponia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And together, those two are sister to four
species of labelia down in Chile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a truly neotropical group going from
Mexico down through Argentina.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their species richness is by far
highest in the cloud forest of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this group, across its about 600
species, not surprisingly, is very diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: in its ecology and morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the floral diversity in this
clade really exemplifies that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some of the species that I've been
lucky enough to collect throughout field
[SPEAKER_02]: work in the neotropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Lysaponia, that high elevation
endemic I mentioned, has a teeny flower
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably bee pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of the flowers on this slide
are vertebrate pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they're pollinated by hummingbirds
in these bright colors here or by bats in
[SPEAKER_02]: these more dull colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this impressive floral diversity is
peritone equally impressive, though maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: less colorful, diversity in overall growth
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, again, I'm going to mention
really fast, this is Lysaponia,
[SPEAKER_02]: shown here out in the wild, and there's
some moss behind it for scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really tiny little plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it occurs in the same overall clade as
Syphocampus tunerensis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a huge tree, but it's still a
tree with a pretty substantial single
[SPEAKER_02]: bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: And growth form within this clade sort of
spans that entire gamut, whether we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about xerophytes that are growing
in the Guiana shield, or hemipophytes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the genus Burmeistera, or this sort of Dr.
Seuss-like monocollish shrub thing that's
[SPEAKER_02]: holding onto its senescent leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really just a fantastic group to get to
study evolution in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I alluded to, Systematics is at the
heart of my research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding how these 600 species
should be delimited and how their species
[SPEAKER_02]: are related is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, part of my research does
involve going into the field and into the
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium and describing new species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also involves establishing a
phylogenetic and, more recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogenomic framework to understand
relationships that can be used to then
[SPEAKER_02]: understand macrovolutionary patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to tell you a little bit
about the work that I've done in
[SPEAKER_02]: establishing the phylogeny of this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably saw my Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Fei Wei.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm going to tell you about what
I've done, research I've done in
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogenetics, but also the work that's
ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, I think, a strand of my
research that will always have something
[SPEAKER_02]: active going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will always be trying to understand more
and more about this group of species.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned at the beginning,
as a whole, they can be subdivided into
[SPEAKER_02]: three major clades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that geography is really
informing relationships in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, for example, we found that Caribbean
species of Cypocampalos are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: really distinctly related from the other
members of its closely allied genera in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mainland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this green clade I've highlighted
here is what we've come to refer to as a
[SPEAKER_02]: centriparagonal clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a group of about 500 species
that's really diverse in their ecology and
[SPEAKER_02]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I'm showing you the phylogeny at the
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can immediately notice that
there's only one monophyletic genus here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burmeistera is, in green, is monophyletic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this monophyletic is well supported by
molecular phylogenetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But further, it's supported by
morphological synapomorphies as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes a dilated anther orifice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unlike other libelioidae, it doesn't
close its anther tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an adaptation probably to bat
pollination, as is this inflated corolla
[SPEAKER_02]: opening that it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has isodiometric seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a well-established clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two genera, however,
are polyphyletic and sort of wildly so
[SPEAKER_02]: with respect to one another, with
centriparagon forming eight separate
[SPEAKER_02]: subclades in Cypocampalos 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is a reflection of this
artificial taxonomy that's based on fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Burmeistera, centriparagon produce
these animal-dispersed berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cypocampalos, on the other hand,
produces these capsules that are
[SPEAKER_02]: abiotically dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe wind occasionally takes them up and
takes them far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mainly, they're probably just gravity
dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from these two traits, these genera
overlap in pretty much all characters,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether vegetative or reproductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this striking nonmonophylae is not
necessarily surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does underlie a really interesting
macroevolutionary trend, which is that
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit evolution has been incredibly
dynamic within this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: From an ancestral capsular state,
we see the independent evolution of
[SPEAKER_02]: berries about eight times independently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of these eight evolutions is
associated with the origin of a
[SPEAKER_02]: well-supported morphologically
well-defined clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to show you sort of the end
product of the convergent evolution of
[SPEAKER_02]: berries, I've put up examples of five of
those subclades here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all either in Burmeistera here
or centriparagon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think these are useful in showing
the fact that, yes, these are all berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all fleshy fruits with many,
many seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that convergent evolution in function
is not necessarily reflected in convergent
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution in form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually quite a lot of
variation in the fruit morphology in this
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're continuing to build a
phylogenetic framework for this group,
[SPEAKER_02]: both at the broad level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an undergraduate, Lauren Frankel,
has been really helpful there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at more targeted lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my graduate student, Janet Mansory,
has been working on establishing the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogeny of a subclade of centriparagon
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our current work uses targeted
sequence capture, which is a method that
[SPEAKER_02]: is really robust to low-quality DNA,
which is important because we use a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium specimens as a major source of
DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with 600 species, even back when
field work was possible, it's really hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to get full sampling across the neotropics
via field work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this method has been really great
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though herbarium specimens aren't
always a panacea to getting really great
[SPEAKER_02]: data, they are useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So herbarium samples perform poorly
compared to silica-dried samples,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in targeted sequence capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that the total number of assembled
base pairs in our data set is less in
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium specimens as compared to
silica-dried leaf tissue that we sequenced
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average contact length is lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of really long contacts,
similarly, is lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet, they've done a really good job at
allowing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This method has done a really good job of
allowing us to put new species into the
[SPEAKER_02]: tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I failed that previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this includes these three species
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyphocampalus planchonis is a species
that's endemic to Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if I could go to the field right
now, I wouldn't be able to collect silica
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue for this species because of the
sociopolitical situation in Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks to Missouri Botanical Garden,
I was able to incorporate it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogeny here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, we were able to include
centropogon electrolophus, a new species
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm describing with Bruce Stein,
into the phylogeny, and as well as my
[SPEAKER_02]: white whale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyphocampalus novelus, I've been trying to
include it in a phylogeny since I was a
[SPEAKER_02]: graduate student because I just love its
linear leaves, but wasn't able to when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was using Sanger sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we now have it pretty well resolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say really quickly that our
phylogenomic analyses really broadly agree
[SPEAKER_02]: with the first phylogeny I showed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're continuing to add
information, the overall story of
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution in the centropogonics in the
clade is really consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've used this phylogeny to really
understand macroevolution in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you a little bit about how
we've looked at the abiotic and biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: drivers of diversification in this clade,
especially in the context of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to introduce you even further to
the tropical Andes, which the Andes
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves are a continental scale
mountain range stretching from Venezuela
[SPEAKER_02]: down through Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tropical Andes sort of end up in
northern Argentina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their global biodiversity hotspot that
encompasses about 1.5 million squared
[SPEAKER_02]: kilometers, which is less than 1% of the
world's terrestrial surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the tropical Andes are home to
15% of all angiosperm diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fully 40,000 species of angiosperms are
native to this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this high level of species richness is
paired with high endemism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really special area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the uplift of the Andes geologically
is pretty recent, at least in the tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the Andes, which in northern
Colombia you can argue are still uplifting
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've definitely been very active in
the last million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this process of really active recent
uplift has been invoked time and time
[SPEAKER_02]: again to explain elevated diversification
rates in really distantly related clades,
[SPEAKER_02]: including hummingbirds, glasswing
butterflies, and these glass frogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the plants world, I think time
after time again, this has been
[SPEAKER_02]: established.
[SPEAKER_02]: But perhaps most famously, we can think of
the Andean lupins, which hopped down from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico about one and a half million years
ago into South America and diversified
[SPEAKER_02]: into more than 80 species pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's important to consider
that the tropical Andes are not one
[SPEAKER_02]: monolithic habitat type, but instead have
a whole lot of habitat heterogeneity
[SPEAKER_02]: within them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are four of the distinct habitat
types that characterize this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the highest part of the Andes,
there are high elevation grasslands
[SPEAKER_02]: characterized by lots of grasses and
sedges that form tussocks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the Paramo in Colombia and
Venezuela, you have also these espoledias,
[SPEAKER_02]: this really charismatic genus.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you go on down the wet eastern slope of
the Andes, these grasslands, including
[SPEAKER_02]: Paramo, give way to cloud forests,
which are where I've done most of my field
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the world's most species-rich
habitat type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super verdant, lush, wet, and cloud-filled
throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're characterized by short trees
and shrubs that are absolutely full of
[SPEAKER_02]: epiphytes, including orchids, mosses,
ferns, bromeliads, like you see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you keep on going down,
an elevation that cloud forest gives way
[SPEAKER_02]: to lowland rainforests, including the
Amazon basin there on the western side,
[SPEAKER_02]: which while maybe not a species-rich,
is very lush and vibrant and absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: charismatic in its flora and fauna.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not all Andean landscapes are green
and lush.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of dry habitats as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, some of the most arid
habitats are in proximity to the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this includes a lot of seasonally dry
forests and really arid inter-Andean
[SPEAKER_02]: valleys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be so dry that cacti can be a
predominant growth form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as to be expected, I would argue
diversification is not homogeneous across
[SPEAKER_02]: these different habitats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see that diversification has
been really fast and really recent when we
[SPEAKER_02]: have clades that have originated in the
last million years and less in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Paramos, which makes sense because they're
the top of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the most, the youngest habitat
type in this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the world's fastest
biodiversity hotspot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also know that the drier areas of
the Andes are a little bit more relictual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the clades that they house tend to be
old and relatively slow-evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relatively few cloud forest clades have
been studied in the context of
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification, I think in part because
there are lots of unwieldy clades that are
[SPEAKER_02]: native here, lots of just very high
species richness, hard to infer
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogenies here that make the subsequent
inference of diversification rates
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we use the neotropical
bellflowers as a model to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: neotropical or Andean diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And first we establish a time-calibrated
phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We showed that from the origin of the
clade about 15 million years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: until about five million years ago,
diversification rates remained relatively
[SPEAKER_02]: flat and relatively slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at five million years ago,
diversification rates exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that net diversification rates
ticked up super quickly coinciding with
[SPEAKER_02]: the origin of the centropagonic clade,
this group of 550 species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, this is a really special
clade in terms of diversification rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that the rates that we have
estimated for centropogon are higher than
[SPEAKER_02]: other Andean lineages with faster
diversification rates, including
[SPEAKER_02]: hummingbirds and those Espeladia that I
showed a few slides ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly, they're also higher than
many famous rapid radiations in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian islands, another area
characterized by sort of young geology and
[SPEAKER_02]: rapid diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those lineages include Hawaiian
drosophila and the Hawaiian silver swords.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what explains this really elevated
diversification rate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, applying state-dependent
diversification models, we found evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: that an association with vertebrate
pollinators results in a six-fold increase
[SPEAKER_02]: in net diversification rates as compared
to invertebrate pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly, that relationships with
fruit dispersers, probably small bats and
[SPEAKER_02]: birds, is associated with a higher rate of
net diversification than those capsular
[SPEAKER_02]: fruits that just sort of drop their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this suggests that mutualism
specifically with vertebrates are really
[SPEAKER_02]: important to the diversification of this
clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also found evidence for the abiotic
environment also driving diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really excited about this model
because it's one of the first times
[SPEAKER_02]: geological data has been incorporated into
a model of diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we thought this was really exciting
and novel.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this side, you see a model of Andean
elevation through time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the right, you see the results of
our analysis, which is basically an
[SPEAKER_02]: extension of a birth-death model.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of modeling through time,
we model against a time-dependent
[SPEAKER_02]: variable, so the elevation here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our best-fitting model, we find that
extinction is not a significant parameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a pure birth model.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that speciation instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be very tightly linked to past
elevation of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A really exciting result, and though not
surprising because, again, this has been
[SPEAKER_02]: about time and time again across other
clades as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This result was corroborated by two other
BISI analyses, one showing that Andean
[SPEAKER_02]: taxa have higher rates of net
diversification than taxa that occur
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly, those at higher elevations
have higher rates of net diversification
[SPEAKER_02]: than those at lower elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so across these series of
diversification analyses, we were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: show that it's a complex interplay of both
abiotic factors, climate and, which I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't show, but climate and Andean
uplift, but also biotic factors as a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with mutualists that
underlies rapid diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would argue that's probably going to
be true in most lineages that occur across
[SPEAKER_02]: this really heterogeneous, topographically
complex area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clades are able to have so many species
because of the scale of this mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: range and because of the many different
sort of ecological interactions that can
[SPEAKER_02]: happen within this matrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxa are able to locally adapt and what
results are these morphologically diverse,
[SPEAKER_02]: species-rich clades that characterize the
tropical Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're beginning to see a similar
pattern across other taxa as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which diversification, often a very
morphologically rich clades, begins in the
[SPEAKER_02]: late Miocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this coincides at the time at which
those mountains were tall enough to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: to capture moisture coming in from the
Amazon basin, forming the clouds that
[SPEAKER_02]: gives cloud forests the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see this in bromeliads,
blueberries, passion flowers, viburnums,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even lycopods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I mentioned before, I really do
think that the evolutionary lability of
[SPEAKER_02]: different lineages to, for example,
converge on hummingbird pollination or to
[SPEAKER_02]: shift fruit type to fit a different
disperser has allowed the coexistence of
[SPEAKER_02]: so many species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this allowed us to, with this
framework, I was able to sort of meld
[SPEAKER_02]: macro evolution of species ecology to
understand at a macro evolutionary scale
[SPEAKER_02]: how evolution of pollination system
syndromes has proceeded in the tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: bellflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you who are unfamiliar with
pollination syndromes, there are suites of
[SPEAKER_02]: floral characteristics that are associated
with the attraction of a particular floral
[SPEAKER_02]: visitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this clade, hummingbird pollination and
bat pollination are relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually share quite a few
characteristics in bellflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers tend to be tubular and produce a
lot of nectar because both hummingbirds
[SPEAKER_02]: and bats are warm-bred pollinators that
need a lot of energy to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hummingbird pollinated flowers tend to
be brightly colored to match sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: high visual acuity of hummingbirds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flowering during the day or they
have diurnal anthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a floral odor and that's
because hummingbirds don't smell very
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, so for pollination
efficacy, they have really narrow floral
[SPEAKER_02]: openings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hummingbirds are best at visiting the
most narrow possible aperture within the
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints of their bill size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So functionally, this is a very important
trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bat pollinated flowers, on the other hand,
tend to be pale at color.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might stand out a little bit at
night, which of course when bats are
[SPEAKER_02]: active and why we see night flowering
flowers or nocturnal anthesis in bat
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also tend to have unpleasant floral
odor or at least tend to be very
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfurous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have importantly a wide floral
opening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to think these bat pollinated
flowers are sort of bat head shape because
[SPEAKER_02]: the bats just put their whole head in when
they visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm gonna really quickly show you
guys a video of bat pollination because I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it tends to be the least familiar
pollination syndrome that I talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's Centropogon nigricans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flowering in the cloud forest of
Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's a really wide flower or
corolla opening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are its big old stamens just
waiting to put pollen on the Anuraphys
[SPEAKER_02]: gelata bat that's about to visit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see as the bat puts its head in,
it reaches its tongue all the way to the
[SPEAKER_02]: base of this 10 centimeter long flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it's doing that, pollen is being
placed very specifically at the nape of
[SPEAKER_02]: this bat's neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a really fantastic interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even more impressive when you
realize that this bat has the longest
[SPEAKER_02]: tongue per body size of any vertebrate,
which it has evolved to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to co-evolution with Centropogon
nigricans, it's the only bat that's able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get to the bottom of this very long
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And subsequently Centropogon nigricans
relies on this bat for reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're really interested in how
pollination syndromes evolved across the
[SPEAKER_02]: clay, not just within askeces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we collected a bunch of data
relevant to pollination biology from
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium specimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing I did with that data
was to pop it into a phylogenetically
[SPEAKER_02]: informed principal components analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a beast of a slide, so I'll go
ahead and walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the overall take home is that
pollination syndromes were really well
[SPEAKER_02]: supported in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we see bat pollinated flowers,
morpho space of bat pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have flowers that are bat
pollinated in green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hummingbird pollinated flowers in either
pink or white, and species for which we
[SPEAKER_02]: know from really good pollination ecology,
we know their pollinators have blue around
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first PC axis is mainly capturing
size variation, and it doesn't do a great
[SPEAKER_02]: job of splitting hummingbird versus bat
flowers, which is not surprising because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're actually pretty similar in size,
these hummingbirds and bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the second PC axis does a really
good job of splitting bat from hummingbird
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this axis, not surprisingly,
is capturing more shape variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go from flowers that are wide,
relatively short, and have big anthers on
[SPEAKER_02]: this part of the axis to flowers that are
longer, narrower, and have small anthers
[SPEAKER_02]: up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A third PC axis further separates species
that are obligately pollinated by this
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful hummingbird species here,
utoxaries, the sicklebill hummingbird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this axis is capturing variation
curvature.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we put these results onto that
phylogeny, we see just like fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution, pollination syndrome evolution
has been really dynamic in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that ancestrally, this clade was
hummingbird pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I'm showing you six species that
are plesiumorphically hummingbird
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated, meaning from the base of that
tree all the way to the present,
[SPEAKER_02]: their lineage is inferred to have been
hummingbird pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want you to notice that the
flowers, while there is quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: variation within them, they are sort of
overall similar in their bow plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within hummingbird pollination,
we have this origination of an obligate
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination by a sicklebill hummingbirds,
this lovely guy, a single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not an evolutionary debt and this
obligate specialization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead, we see multiple occasions in
which a relationship with this bird has
[SPEAKER_02]: been lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fantastically, we see that bat
pollination has evolved about 14 times
[SPEAKER_02]: independently within this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I'm showing you seven examples
from fully half of those independent
[SPEAKER_02]: evolutions of bat pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And compared to those hummingbird
pollinated flowers, you can see the
[SPEAKER_02]: convergent origination of those flowers
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tend to be overall similar in
those traits that we measure that are
[SPEAKER_02]: functionally really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of personality to these
flowers as well across the different
[SPEAKER_02]: originations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so not surprisingly, there's a suite
of adaptive traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see evidence for evolution of
pollination syndromes via the application
[SPEAKER_02]: of these Ornstein-Ulenbeck models that
allow us to look at correlated evolution
[SPEAKER_02]: within pollination syndromes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this means as lineages shipped
from hummingbird to bat pollination their
[SPEAKER_02]: traits change simultaneously as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, as we go from flowers that
are long and have short peduncles,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is important in hummingbird
pollination, as we shift to bat
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination, flowers simultaneously get
wider and get those long peduncles that
[SPEAKER_02]: are so characteristic of bat pollinated
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But despite this really dynamic pattern of
pollination syndrome evolution and this
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence for macroevolution and
evolutionary importance of these
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators and driving morphological
evolution, we don't see any differences in
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification rate between hummingbird
and bat pollinated lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would argue that instead,
like I said a few slides ago, it's this
[SPEAKER_02]: clay's ability to shift so readily between
the pollination syndromes that has allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: this clay to host so many species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this observation really motivated my
next research question, which is what role
[SPEAKER_02]: do pollinator shifts play in speciation
within this clay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this bit allows me to put together the
microevolution and species ecology,
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of that Venn diagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to get at this, we studied a system
in Bolivia of three different centropogon
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centropogon bretonianus, centropogon
mandonus, and centropogon incanus,
[SPEAKER_02]: shown here a little worse for the wear
after a day of riding in the car with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these species are endemic to
Bolivia, but they have really different
[SPEAKER_02]: ranges within Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centropogon bretonianus and mandonus,
they're both high elevation species that
[SPEAKER_02]: are occurring at the highest extent of
cloud forest right before transitions to
[SPEAKER_02]: grasslands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bretonianus is a very narrow endemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just found in a handful of
populations outside of La Paz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centropogon mandonus, on the other hand,
is this widespread taxon that's found
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout this elevational band
throughout Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centropogon incanus is sort of like
bretonianus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a relatively narrow distribution,
though not nearly as narrow as
[SPEAKER_02]: bretonianus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But importantly, it's occurring lower on
the mountain slopes than bretonianus and
[SPEAKER_02]: mandonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of a low cloud forest
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a really interesting study
system for us because where one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: species fell within the morphological
space, and we see that centropogon
[SPEAKER_02]: mandonus, which we inferred to be
hummingbird pollinated based on its red
[SPEAKER_02]: flower color, however, it was falling sort
of on the outskirts of bat morpho space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that led us to ask, is this,
what's the better signal, color or shape,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is there something more complex going
on?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we set up a bunch of cameras to see
what was happening with the pollination of
[SPEAKER_02]: these three species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And centropogon incanus, with its big
white flowers, we predicted would be bat
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do see, in fact, that bats were
really good and regular visitors to the
[SPEAKER_02]: species down at those lower, warmer
elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw hummingbirds visiting these flowers
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't notice, however,
that when this bird is going into the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, it's not always making contact
with those reproductive organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a second here, it's going to zoom
down to this flower down in the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to enter that flower from the
side, totally issuing any sort of contact
[SPEAKER_02]: with the reproductive organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this hummingbird, while it is a
floral visitor, is often acting as a
[SPEAKER_02]: nectar robber in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's costly to this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not as good a visitor as that last bat
who, even though it was a real quick
[SPEAKER_02]: visit, did a really good job of
transferring pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, we were most interested in
what was going on in centropogon mandonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw that hummingbirds do,
in fact, visit this flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of what we predicted based
on the flower color.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that morphos space, we also
thought bats might be good visitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my delight, they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so across 243 hours of video,
we see that there's a gradient of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination, specialization in this clade
from primarily bat pollination in
[SPEAKER_02]: centropogon and canis to a pretty balanced
generalist in centropogon mandonus,
[SPEAKER_02]: which relies on both hummingbirds and bats
for effective pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: With centropogon betonianus sort of in
that middle zone, its primary pollinator
[SPEAKER_02]: is certainly bats, though hummingbirds are
important secondary pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was, of course, a really fun
result for us because what this meant is
[SPEAKER_02]: that mandonus, as a balanced generalist,
that color and shape mismatch were sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: underlying its ecological generalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this really sort of interesting result
where we were able to use
[SPEAKER_02]: macroevolutionary analyses to actually
predict something about species ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, it's sort of done the opposite
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, being an evolutionary
biologist, I put this in a phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_02]: context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually, it gets even more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are each other's closest related
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is strong support in the entire
phylogeny as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we zoom on into just this subclade,
we see that centropogon betonianus and
[SPEAKER_02]: centropogon mandonus are sister species
that occur in sympatry that are sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators, which is a really sort of
stunning result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're sister to centropogon and
canis with whom they share one of their
[SPEAKER_02]: key pollinators and maybe individual
pollinators too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bats can certainly go up and down in
elevation in a way that an individual
[SPEAKER_02]: plant can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this canis is, of course, occurring in
parapatry to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a really stunning result
with very close relatives sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators in close geographic proximity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This pattern is further supported by
phylogeographic results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we find, whether we're applying sort
of this astral species tree framework,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see we have really strong support for
monophyly of each of these species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do a PCA of the SNP data as
well, we see that they're really sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: in different parts of that PCA space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So real strong support for monophyly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we analyze the SNP data in a
population context, look for potential
[SPEAKER_02]: introgression, we don't see a whole lot of
evidence of introgression within this
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there might be some cases of
individuals that are maybe the product of
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization or introgression,
but it doesn't seem like hybridization is
[SPEAKER_02]: swamping out everything in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might predict if these were
closely related species sort of swamp that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have reproductive isolation
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, of course, we want to know whether
or not at this point, if these individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: reflect recent introgression or maybe this
is sort of ancestral sorting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still analyzing this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a really interesting result that we
have that's sort of hard to reconcile with
[SPEAKER_02]: that last slide is that using a method
that looks at phylogenetic invariance to
[SPEAKER_02]: find hybridization or evidence of
hybridization, we find really strong
[SPEAKER_02]: support for hybrid origin of centripovon
mandonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sort of counterintuitive,
too, because it's the species that's sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of the most different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually expecting that this species
might be a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if this is the case, a pattern that
would be consistent with our structure
[SPEAKER_02]: results on the last slide, here in this is
a pattern in which centripovon mandonus
[SPEAKER_02]: arose via allopolyploidy between two
species and then through time was able to
[SPEAKER_02]: evolve sort of these private snips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, if allopolyploidy is
invoked, is actually what's at play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reproductive isolation would have happened
at the time of origination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a potential explanation
that we are currently investigating into
[SPEAKER_02]: what may be allowing these three species
to coexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we continue to analyze this data,
we still have strong evidence that whether
[SPEAKER_02]: or not they're completely reproductively
isolated or if they are still able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: gene flow, we do know that pollen transfer
is being minimized by morphological
[SPEAKER_02]: traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we see that centripovon bretonianus
and mandonus have significantly different
[SPEAKER_02]: stamen lengths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, of course, important because
it determines placement of pollen on those
[SPEAKER_02]: bat and hummingbird bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this difference is very much
exaggerated in sympatry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about 10% shorter stamen of
centripovon mandonus when it co-occurs
[SPEAKER_02]: with bretonianus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this system, it seems like
there's differential pollinator use that's
[SPEAKER_02]: mediated by key differences in floral
shape and likely a reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: incompatibility that's due to potential
hybrid origin of one of the players here
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows these three species to
co-occur in close geographic proximity in
[SPEAKER_02]: this really complex region, providing some
insight into what, at a clade level,
[SPEAKER_02]: may be driving this pattern of rapid
diversification and sort of high species
[SPEAKER_02]: richness in the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're continuing to look at this
intersection of microevolution and species
[SPEAKER_02]: ecology in the context of pollinator
evolution in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we're really interested
especially in that origin of the obligate
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction with the sickle-billed
hummingbird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we're not just
interested in the relationship between
[SPEAKER_02]: centripovon and the hummingbird,
but its entire suite of food plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: which also includes Heliconia,
which, again, I study as an undergrad with
[SPEAKER_02]: Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so two members of my lab, Janet and
Laura, are busy working on the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janet's establishing a phylogenetic
framework for this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use centripovon clay that's
pollinated, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not exclusively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Laura's been really diving into a
system within Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have centripovon granulosus,
this curvy flowered species, sister to
[SPEAKER_02]: centripovon solanofolius.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two species have really different
floral morphology that suggests that
[SPEAKER_02]: centripovon granulosus relies on a single
hummingbird within its pollinator
[SPEAKER_02]: community, whereas solanofolius might rely
on up to six species of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a situation where we have
sister species co-occurring with these
[SPEAKER_02]: really important differences in floral
shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Laura wanted to understand what
might be allowing these two species to
[SPEAKER_02]: co-occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she took measurements from herbarium
specimens that have been collected in
[SPEAKER_02]: Monteverde, Costa Rica, where these two
species occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: They overlap at mid-elevations,
but centripovon solanofolius, these
[SPEAKER_02]: circular dots, goes higher up on the
mountains than centripovon granulosus,
[SPEAKER_02]: these squares, which go lower down the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Laura did see a little bit of overlap
in the floral morphos space between the
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see sort of, especially around here,
you see a little bit of overlap between
[SPEAKER_02]: those circles and those squares.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, where species do co-occur on the
mountain, we don't see any overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see this gap in morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is, again, a pattern
consistent with character displacement
[SPEAKER_02]: following recent speciation and had
everything on the way that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't giving a talk on Zoom today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have been in Costa Rica over the
summer collecting pollinator data and
[SPEAKER_02]: population genetic data for the system to
really test that hypothesis, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really think this is a great system
to integrate macro and microevolution with
[SPEAKER_02]: ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, because we know the
systematics, we're able to ask some really
[SPEAKER_02]: focused questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most of my talk so far has really
focused on that first prong, that really
[SPEAKER_02]: deep dive into a single clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to end my talk by
telling you a little bit of the research
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing on more of that broadside and
the taxonomy and evolution of understudy
[SPEAKER_02]: neotropical plant lineages, including
these guys here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my lab is busy establishing the first
phylogenies for these clades here,
[SPEAKER_02]: freziera and the pentafilic caseae in the
Erychales.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know that family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merista caseae, or Otobe in the nutmeg
family, Merista caseae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helia and Helicraea in the coffee family,
Rubiesae in this high elevation endemic
[SPEAKER_02]: genus, Amilostomes and Brachiodome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these groups are really good
complements to the neotropical bellflowers
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have different natural
history, different environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: preferences, different ecological
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll be able to compare how
they're responding to the different
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of the neotropical landscape to
really begin to understand a more
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated perspective on neotropical
plant evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to quickly show you a
few of the examples of the impact of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Andes on diversification in this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, in Brachiodome that Diego
is working on, he sees that species ranges
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to be really, really narrow,
even though species species tend to be
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really different in close
proximity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this suggests to us, these
species ranges, is that once Diego finally
[SPEAKER_02]: gets that phylogeny he's currently working
on, that we're going to see that the Andes
[SPEAKER_02]: have been a real motor for speciation,
that allopatry during mount uplift and
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleistocene glaciations has probably
driven evolution in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in other lineages, such as Otobe,
which is more of a low cloud forest clade,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see that the Andes instead are really
important biogeographic barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the evolution of this, the origin of
this clade, it hopped over from Africa
[SPEAKER_02]: about five million years ago, it's only
been able to cross the Andes a single
[SPEAKER_02]: time, which makes some sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really big, big fruits that are
pollinated by big body birds and primates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those don't cross mountains very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the single time Otobe has been able to
hop over the Andes, it became very well
[SPEAKER_02]: established and has become one of the 10
most ecologically dominant genera in the
[SPEAKER_02]: western Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, in Hylia, that my grad
student Lamone's working on, she has
[SPEAKER_02]: really good evidence that the different
ecological interactions that these species
[SPEAKER_02]: can have are really different,
depending on what the environment within
[SPEAKER_02]: the neotropics you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of unlike in central Pogom,
where we see hummingbird and bat
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated species going crazy in cloud
forests, instead she sees that hawk moths
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to be really important pollinators in
cloud forests, which really gets to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that while we are searching for
generalities in Andean plant evolution
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout our research, there are also
going to be a lot of wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: idiosyncracies that we find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really by comparing differences
between clades that we'll be able to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: a fully integrative story of Andean plant
evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope I've convinced you that the
Andes sort of their continental scale and
[SPEAKER_02]: that opportunity for local adaptation and
tons of allopatry is really one of the key
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons why the neotropics are so diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I love to do fieldwork in this
amazingly beautiful part of the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ended up spending more of my
time in herbaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I told you about taxonomic data,
morphological data, distribution data,
[SPEAKER_02]: and DNA sequence data that I got all from
herbarium specimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbarium specimens are so important in
becoming literate in a group to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask, to pose these big macro revolutionary
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a continually broad source of
data of very different types as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really great being able to
spend time in herbaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with that, I'm going to say thank
you, including to those institutions that
[SPEAKER_02]: I visited to be able to collect the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are very listed below.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to acknowledge my amazing lab whose
sort of diverse perspectives and just the
[SPEAKER_02]: ways they approach science have really
pushed me as a scientist and as a mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I also have fantastic
co-authors and have had luck in the field
[SPEAKER_02]: and with funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with that, I have no idea if I,
oh, I think I might have time for
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to ask a question in
this public Zoom format, feel free to
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot me a question at my email address up
here or find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to talk one-on-one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have to leave this to see if
there are any chat questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clap emojis make me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so if anyone wants to ask any
questions, feel free to unmute and ask a
[SPEAKER_01]: question or you can place it into the
chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dora.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Gaurav.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in our discussion, we spoke about how
self-compatibility has evolved in solanum
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrochitis in this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, there are two species that
have passed the amatopevanka-pampa zone,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, in solanums, which have evolved
from self-incompatibility to
[SPEAKER_04]: compatibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have been moving through
dandies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering, what is the general
frequency of shifting from not just the
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination modes, but also from
incompatibility to compatibility in
[SPEAKER_04]: different systems to come across that
information?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is such a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those, so this morning when we
were talking, I was like, I wish I had
[SPEAKER_02]: that data for all these species,
because the system you're working on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you do have so much data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I don't have all that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you that in general,
species of libilioides tend to be
[SPEAKER_02]: self-compatible, but they tend to not be
self-pollinated often because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: morphology of their flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are two-phase flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we have it in male phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's first.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually really early female
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's a better slide for
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretend that you don't see that stigma
popping out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is this phase where pollen is
going to be taken out of the flower first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only after that do we see the stigma
coming out and opening and being
[SPEAKER_02]: receptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually, that stigma doesn't come out
until pollen has been shed completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, it's part of the constraint
of growth of the stigma column is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's pushing against pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until pollen is released, it can't
really grow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's sort of my frustrating
answer is that I don't think shifts are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has definitely not been studied in
much detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that there are hybrids
between species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like it can be fairly hard to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speciation isn't always associated with
reproductive isolation in this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that my postdoc advisor,
Nathan Mutel, is looking at the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: for hybridization across species,
which might give some insight into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we really don't know anything about
mating system in this group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Joyce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really inspirational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down two questions, one of which
you answered while you were talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is always great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second question was about the
three species that you looked at with the
[SPEAKER_00]: red, yellow, and white colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question pertaining to that is,
do you see intermediate colors between
[SPEAKER_00]: those three species?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask that because you said this
briefly that when two of those species are
[SPEAKER_00]: in sympatry, the stigma length are more
exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you also see other floral traits
related to their pollination syndrome that
[SPEAKER_00]: are also exaggerated, such as the color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that data not really possible
because you're mostly working with
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium specimens to get enough data?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that there is a lot of
color variation within these species.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to come right back to the slide,
but really quickly to show you,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is all variation within Centrifogon
brittoniana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be pure cream, and it can go
all the way to trying to look like
[SPEAKER_02]: mandonis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But plenty of morphological characters
support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of variation within
brittoniana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did see quite a few hummingbirds and
bats visiting the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think in our data, hummingbirds
and bats were both important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's being a signal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But flower color is also something we're
hoping to look at a little bit more in
[SPEAKER_02]: detail in Canis species as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially in my postdoc, I wanted to go
do what all young, optimistic evolutionary
[SPEAKER_02]: biologists want to do and go show that
there's sympatric species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sympatric speciation going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I was a graduate student,
I collected these two individuals in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same habitat, basically very next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this had wide flowers that were stinky
and white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this had narrow flowers that were
pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so unfortunately, when I went back to
Bolivia to do field work, this had been
[SPEAKER_02]: taken over by Cana, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cana bangii and others enderberry leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that question, the ability to ask
that question specifically disappeared in
[SPEAKER_02]: between I think 2010 and 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that color evolution and color
being a signal is really important in this
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other lobeleoids, including closely
related Burmese stera, also in Iachroma
[SPEAKER_02]: and Salenaceae, the different colors seem
to be playing a signal to the pollinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that in this clade,
for whatever reason, the Peruvian,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a cladocentral codon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem that it is particularly
labile and very likely might be one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons why floral morphology can be
pushed in one direction because of that
[SPEAKER_02]: plasticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would love to spend more time with this
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Laura.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for your talk and showing all those
nice pictures that feel like home to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a question about phenology.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in that case where you have
all these sympatrix species, do they show
[SPEAKER_03]: different time for flowering or something
like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they are just simultaneously flowering?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we haven't looked at that with that
much detail, I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the field twice for this
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in December, Encanis is in flower and
Mandonis is in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think for Tomianises.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think there is a little bit of
phenology going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we went back in March,
they were all in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not 100 percent like, you know,
it's not this perfect one goes on and the
[SPEAKER_02]: other comes on and they're sort of
temporally isolated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is definitely overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried to look at herbarium
specimens to see if there is good evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: of phases that there just isn't the bulk
of data you need to really do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that would be, you know,
if I had more time in the system,
[SPEAKER_02]: in addition to color, I think looking at a
full year's phenology would be super
[SPEAKER_02]: important as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another quick one is, did you find
that, like, I don't know, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: how specific are those pollinators for
each species?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get like, I don't know,
10 species of bats visiting the same
[SPEAKER_03]: species and the same thing for
hummingbirds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we unfortunately weren't able to
look at the bat, get bat species
[SPEAKER_02]: identification because I didn't actually
collect any pollinators unless we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the permits for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but there are two species of bats that
occur in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my postdoc advisor, who is a bat guy,
thought that it was just one species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, that's only speculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the two species, with the
hummingbirds, there's only one species
[SPEAKER_02]: that visited the low elevation species and
then there are two different hummingbird
[SPEAKER_02]: species that visited Bretonianus and
Mandona.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think those two species might have
been the entire hummingbird community at
[SPEAKER_02]: these two because it was pretty high
elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only two we saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to some bird people who sort of
confirmed that, it seemed likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I don't really think these are
super specialized for any specific
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that happens often,
though I've touched on two cases in which
[SPEAKER_02]: there is sort of that co-evolutionary link
that occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one would be that video I showed you
from National Geographic in Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: So centropogon igracans with 10 centimeter
long flower, which like, take out your
[SPEAKER_02]: ruler and look at that sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like a co-evolutionary ratchet
that happened where there is real good
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other case, of course,
is in the centropogon heliconia sicklebell
[SPEAKER_02]: system, where it's probably a one-to-many
relationship between one bird and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: five or six individuals and five or six
species within a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're out of our time, but I just
want to thank Laura again for coming and
[SPEAKER_01]: giving us this inspirational seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was fantastic to see so many
bright pictures as we move into our fall
[SPEAKER_01]: season and our bright leaves that we're
going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see all the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody has any questions,
as Laura said, feel free to email her or
[SPEAKER_01]: find her on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
