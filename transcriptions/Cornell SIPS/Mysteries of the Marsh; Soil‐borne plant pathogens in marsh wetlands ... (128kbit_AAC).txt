[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the people in the back hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Eric mentioned, today I'll be
talking about my dissertation research and
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on this topic of the mysteries of
the marsh, looking at soil-borne plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens in marsh wetlands and their
impact on invasive and native plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through my dissertation research,
I've been really trying to answer the
[SPEAKER_00]: question of whether soil pathogens are
contributing to the success of invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in marsh wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the work that I've done is
just laying the groundwork to answer this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's seminar, I'm going to be
focusing on presenting to you a few
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments that are answering questions
that I think really enable us to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, do invasive plants change
soil in a way that decreases seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: survival?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which OMI seeds and fungi are present in
marsh wetland soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are these OMI seeds and fungi
pathogens of marsh plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how virulent are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this picture, you can see two fields
right near where I work at the north end
[SPEAKER_00]: of Cayuga Lake in the Montezuma Wetlands
Complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the left, you have something that
perhaps is a little more familiar to those
[SPEAKER_00]: of us in this room and in this department.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wheat field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right, this is a marsh wetland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a lot of differences right
off the bat between these two areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the biggest difference,
and kind of relatively the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between agricultural areas,
which are highly managed, and less
[SPEAKER_00]: managed, more natural areas, is diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this diversity is both the richness and
evenness of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the richness being the number of
species that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their evenness being their abundance
relative to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also happens on both a genotypic
and a spatial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think of, in this corn field,
there's probably just one genotype there,
[SPEAKER_00]: one species, but also one genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you're going to have a lot of
different species, a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes within each species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spatial heterogeneity is much
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one exception to the rule that natural
areas tend to be really highly diverse are
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by invasive plants, I mean that these
are non-native plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've evolved somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come to a new place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rapidly expanding their range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, they have some
negative consequence, either on humans
[SPEAKER_00]: economically or on some ecosystem
services, like animal habitat or
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity of plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this picture, you can see two
invasive plants dominating this marsh
wetland.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the foreground here is Fowler's from
Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reed canary grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the background is Phragmites astralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phragmites are common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they're both growing
in really dense stands, excluding the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of other plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if most natural areas are highly
diverse, how are invasive plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do this, able to grow so densely?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of ecological research has
looked into plant traits of these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the fact that they're able to grow
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow taller, shade out other
plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But increasingly, people are looking at
the effect that they're having on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many invasive plants change soil
properties, abiotic and biotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: in ways that put them at an advantage and
the other competitors at a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called soil condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested in how that's happening
with invasive plants in marsh wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that different from what native
plants are doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little background on what's
happening in most native plants' natural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have density-dependent recruitment of
seedlings, which contributes to the high
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine the probability that a
seedling will survive, and the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular plant species in the soil,
there's going to be higher survival when
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant species is at low density,
and lower survival when that plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: is at high density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that people found this out was
in the 1970s, two ecologists, Jansen and
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell, saw that in tropical forests,
if there's a parent tree species,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of species near
the parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what I'm considering a
high density of that particular plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are going to be a few seedlings
that are further away at low density of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the seedlings near the parent
tree die, or do very poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that are further away at a low
density have a much higher probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: survival, and eventually fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they first found this,
they thought that it was probably mammals,
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of seed predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But increasingly, people have found that
no, it's plant pathogens in the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: are causing these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So related to that, I wanted to know
what's going on with invasive plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they can avoid those density dependent
effects in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this picture, I really like this,
because this is a phragmites, beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: tall grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right in the background here,
you have another beautiful tall grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the fields that I work in
are right next to agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are monocultures of very
dominant, very tall grass species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those of you who work in
agriculture know it's really hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: corn to grow like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't naturally want to not have
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't manage it, if you didn't
rotate crops, you'd have big problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: both with weeds and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are invasive plant species,
and this plant species in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are they able to do this with their
inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people are finding is plants have
different pathogen interactions in their
[SPEAKER_00]: native and invaded ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think back to those density
dependent soil effects and the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil pathogens, that they are playing a
role in the success of many invasive plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example of this, why we think this
is happening, is that if you grow the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species, for the most part,
in the same soil year after year,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna do more poorly each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you in agriculture know that this
is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to rotate your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same happens with native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at plant soil feedback,
and over time, it'll be lower and lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant soil feedback being the term for how
much the soil often feeds back to those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants' survival and success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So native plants do worse, invasive plants
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people have found that they are
neutral when grown in the same soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe even can benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're having some kind of
different interactions there for native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we think is happening,
one hypothesis, is called enemy release,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is that when invasive plants
come, they leave behind pathogens from
[SPEAKER_00]: their native range, and it takes time for
them to accumulate and acquire them when
[SPEAKER_00]: they invade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine this invasive plant,
and it's native range, it's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a diverse group of pathogens, including
some soil pathogens I've illustrated here,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it leaves those behind in an invaded
range, it can sometimes do better because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not experiencing those
density-dependent negative feedbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one classic example of this was with
Prunus serotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our black cherry is invasive in Europe,
and it's able to grow in really dense
[SPEAKER_00]: stands, unlike here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that it's
encountering less virulent soil pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly genus Pythium, that don't
have the same density-dependent effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seedlings are able to survive
through adulthood, and that's why it can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in such dense stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that were happening in a marsh
wetland, you'd expect to see invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species less susceptible to
pathogens in the invaded range than native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd expect that native plants would
accumulate more virulent pathogens than
[SPEAKER_00]: invasives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another hypothesis for how invasive plants
are interacting with pathogens in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that puts them at an advantage is that
they're somehow changing the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: population when they invade in a way that
puts native plants at a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be them bringing in
pathogens with them, that would then
[SPEAKER_00]: spread into a native community,
or it could be just something about their
[SPEAKER_00]: arrival changes the pathogen community in
such a way that native plants have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: disease and decreased survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we've got a plant coming into a
mixed plant community, an invasive plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's bringing with it some pathogens
that would then spread into the native
[SPEAKER_00]: plant community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hypothesis is called spill back,
or spill over, and a few examples are with
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive grasses in the western United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several are known to bring with them
viruses that would then spread into a
[SPEAKER_00]: native plant population and increase the
disease that they're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example that doesn't involve a
plant bringing in anything with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just changing the existing pathogen
community is with cheap grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the western United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cheap grass is a prolific seed
producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After its arrival, there's a lot more
seeds in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The abundance of those seeds really
increases, and the native plants have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard time out competing with cheap grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that were happening, you'd expect to
see a pathogen community changing after an
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive plant colonizes, and you'd expect
maybe increased abundance or virulence of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens after invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a few different hypotheses for
how pathogens could be driving the success
[SPEAKER_00]: of invasive plants, both because invasives
escape pathogens from their native range,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes time for them to accumulate them
in an invaded range, and they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to change the pathogen community when
they invade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know how important these are
for invasive plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, I want to know what's
going on in marsh wellings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the studies I just described
take place in forest and grassland
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, but marshes are really important
for understanding invasive success for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, they're highly invaded systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about the kind of most
important invasive plants in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America, phragmites, astralis,
green canary grass, purple loosestripe,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of those are in marsh wellings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding what's going on there I
think would be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, marsh wellings provide important
ecosystem services, water quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this area, a lot of the
microtransactions of the migratory birds
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through where I work at the north end
of Cuyahoga Lake, so they need that
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the issue of the kind of
different plants that are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: these invasive plants are preventing them
from growing, so the biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are lots of omicids and fungi
in marsh soils when people have looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Europe, they also have marsh
wellings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some of our invasives are needed
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people have looked,
they found really abundant communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know if that's happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed bank establishment and seedling
establishment are really key for the
[SPEAKER_00]: success of a lot of these plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So paired with the fact that there are a
lot of soil omicids and fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probable that there's some
interaction going on where pathogens could
[SPEAKER_00]: be determining what the plant communities
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, some of the pathogens
that are known to affect the dieback or
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of death of a lot of the weed species
in Europe are omicids, similar to what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we find here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know if they're also playing
an important role in our marsh wellings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I begin, I just want to
introduce you to a few of the plants I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, Phragmites australis, I mentioned
it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's non-native, it's European,
and I think it can be seen here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 1800s and since it's been replacing a
lot of native plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably seen it on the road sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lining a lot of the highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also important in wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it forms these large clonal patches,
like you can see here, extremely dense and
[SPEAKER_00]: quite tall if you get up to 13 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the interesting things about
Phragmites is that they're both native and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-native genotypes here in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good species for us to be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it gives us a closely related pair
of native and invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also be talking about a couple
other invasives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alleris aranaceae, reed canary grass,
and lithrum salicaria, purple roostrife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also probably seen these around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one is particularly
beautiful, even though it isn't invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be mentioning a few native plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epilovium glandulosum is a very herbaceous
native plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calamagrassus canadensis, a grass species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the experiments I'll be talking about,
I'll be using just a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different native plant species as kind of
a proxy for what's going on in that
[SPEAKER_00]: community with less attention to what
particular hosts or plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question, I think,
for determining if plant pathogens and
[SPEAKER_00]: soil pathogens in particular are playing a
role in the success of invasive plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species, is seeing does the invasive plant
change the soil in a way that decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling survival?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to note Phragmites australis,
that invasive plant I mentioned initially,
[SPEAKER_00]: is changing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be abiotic or biotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some invasive plants exude allelopathic
chemicals that are toxic to other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm particularly interested in
pathogens, so I want to know, is it
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing seedling survival of other
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this caused by soil, fungi,
and neuromyces?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get at this question,
there are a couple different experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I've planted seedlings of eight
native plant species at four sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see me carefully measuring
some seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: At each site, I cleared plots within and
outside of the stand of Phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this you can see the dense Phragmites
around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I cleared those sites is
that I wanted to exclude factors like
[SPEAKER_00]: shading and crowding that people typically
think are why Phragmites are so
[SPEAKER_00]: successful, and just look in the field at
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a month, I assessed seedling
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a plot outside of the
Phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see I've drawn a square here
just so you can see where the plot is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the kind of much more diverse
vegetation outside of the Phragmites
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some little patches of
green here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what those are are the seedlings that
I transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of them, a grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was that there was
overall lower survival in Phragmites
[SPEAKER_00]: stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a portion of seedlings
surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is plant species transplanted,
so a number of different plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow is inside, and the green is
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, there's a clear trend that
things did better outside of the stands
[SPEAKER_00]: than inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some site-specific effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think these soil changes take time to
accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my sites was a more recent
invasion, and it didn't have those
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, it's only significant
for a couple plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, there's a clear trend that
Phragmites seems to be doing something to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decreases the survival of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer what exactly is happening in
the soil, I did a secondary study with my
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborator, Laura Martin, and some
members of Baron Velasquez's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at seedlings' survival in a more
controlled container setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took soil from these Phragmites
common gardens that had been conditioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: grown with Phragmites, and then planted 10
different marsh wetland plant species in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of these containers were treated
with a broad-spectrum chlorothalonil
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide that should be somewhat
effective against both fungi and OMI
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if you exclude those from the soil,
do you still see Phragmites having a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effect on the survival of these
plant species?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, there were many
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is similar to,
in the previous study, for some species,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not all, Phragmites did have a
negative effect on seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brown is potting mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow is Phragmites-conditioned soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green is that soil with fungicide
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the asterisks represent a significant
interaction or contribution of that factor
[SPEAKER_00]: to the proportion of seedling surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that for a few of these
species, there was a significant decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were grown in the Phragmites
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for pretty much all of them,
the fungicide increased survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, it brought survival
back up to the level that it would be in
[SPEAKER_00]: potting mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see right here and here,
the fungicide is able to take away those
[SPEAKER_00]: soil effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer that question, does
Phragmites soil conditioning, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that it makes to soil,
affect seedling survival?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find that it decreases survival of
some plant species, but not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this was caused by soil and
fungi, or soil OMI seeds and fungi for
[SPEAKER_00]: some plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that these fungi and OMI seeds
are playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know which species these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next question was trying to identify
which OMI seeds and fungi are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hypotheses were that they'd be
diverse and abundant, both for fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: OMI seeds, just based on what people have
found in other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that there'd be different pathogens,
or actually not pathogens, fungi and OMI
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds associated with different plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen part will come later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the OMI seeds, we sampled field
soil at four sites, both
[SPEAKER_00]: Phragmites-invaded and non-invaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we isolated OMI seeds using a leaf
bait method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see there's some soil at
the bottom of this tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are leaves at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that selects for OMI seeds,
because it requires swimming zoospores to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach and affect the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used a warp selective media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after isolating, we extracted DNA from
the isolates and sequenced the ITS1 and 2
[SPEAKER_00]: region of the RRNA operon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got about 500 isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, they're really
dominated by pythium species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some phytopithium, some sacralegnia,
but mostly pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you divide this up by which pythium
species were we seeing, pythium inflatum,
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium dissimiline, pythium herethalicum,
and atranthuridium, and aquatile
[SPEAKER_00]: angostotum, those are kind of the dominant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worth noting that, a really large
percentage, about 20%, were species that
[SPEAKER_00]: only have less than 10 isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are we seeing a lot,
so we're seeing a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing some dominant species,
but a lot of minor ones that still might
[SPEAKER_00]: play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you compare how frequently these
species were isolated from pragmites
[SPEAKER_00]: invaded and non-invaded soils,
you do see some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species, this is the difference in
isolation frequency right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a zero would mean that there was no
difference in how frequently they were
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated from two soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are more common in non-invaded,
and these are more common in the pragmites
[SPEAKER_00]: invaded soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that some species,
pythium irregularum, pythium pragmitus,
[SPEAKER_00]: are more common in the non-invaded soils,
while others, like pythium torileusum and
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium aeronomnes, were more common in
the invaded soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at fungi, we took a little
different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my fantastic field assistant
here planting containers in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we buried seed baits at 10 sites,
using the seeds of nine different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these seeds overwintered in the field,
and in the spring we collected them,
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted the seeds from each container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we isolated fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see this is a seed from
one of those containers, and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: hyphae growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the hyphae from each isolate
growing, and repeatedly transferred it so
[SPEAKER_00]: we could make sure they had pure culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we identified these isolates,
sequencing them the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, I have a larger culture
collection of around 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, we've sequenced about 266
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a lot of different fungal
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Alternaria, Foma, Epococca,
and Fusarium, seem to be the dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of others,
especially in this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genera was left with one isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at this, by plant
species, so remember, we have those nine
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant species that we're
isolating the fungi from, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: different fungi are associated with the
seeds of different plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these circles is roughly the
number of isolates that we have from each
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Fowlerus and Virundinica,
the invasive that I mentioned with canary
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has a pretty even mix of different
genus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Phragmites, it's very dominated by
Foma, also some Alternaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Keris phraekii, which is a native
sedge, the dominant genus is Alternaria
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're finding associated with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I did surface sterilize the
seeds before putting them into these field
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's possible that some of these fungi
are coming in with the seeds, rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: being acquired from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still some clear differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which fungi and omicids are present in
marsh wetland soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did indeed find diverse abundant
omicids and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for omicids, the dominant genus was
Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For fungi, the dominant genera were
Alternaria, Foma and Epococum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there did seem to be different
species, associating with different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some fungi and omicids are more common
with particular plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, I want to know, sure,
we know what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are they actually doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these pathogens of marsh plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how virulent are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hypothesis going into this,
just based on the types of genera that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were seeing, Pythium in particular,
is that we find a lot of generalist
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thinking back to some of those
hypotheses for why invasive plants are so
[SPEAKER_00]: successful, I expected that native plants
would be more susceptible, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates from the native species would be
more virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to test this, we set up bioassays for
both fungi and omicids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the structure of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added a group of isolates of each on an
auger plate and waited until the mycelia
[SPEAKER_00]: had grown out far enough, and then added
seeds of different plant species to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty artificial assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not what's going on in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it at least gives us some idea of
whether or not, if given all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities, these isolates can be
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by pathogenic, I mean that they
decrease seedling survival when inoculated
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to a control that's
un-inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for virulence, I'm defining that
as the degree of that decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this top frame, you can see a
control un-inoculated plate growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of Phragmites strawlis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one, you can see a non-pathogenic
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those seedlings are doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a low-virulence isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one that does decrease the survival of
these seedlings relative to a control,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that they're still pretty high
seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this bottom frame are some
high-virulence isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So few, if any, of those seedlings are
still surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measured seedlings survival at the
end of three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for the omicids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show them first and then the fungi
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of this as a heat map with the
different pythium species here in order of
[SPEAKER_00]: their relative abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how frequently we isolated them from
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the plant species that we
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these ones in green are native.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones in yellow are invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that some plant
species are highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the darker the red, the kind of bigger
impact, the more virulent those pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those with a significant decrease from
the control, so those I deem pathogenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: are shaded in any shade of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those that are white did not appear
significantly to increase seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the really dark red, you can see here,
epilobium glandulosa, one of the native
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species, was the most susceptible to
these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this invasive lithium
salicaria was also extremely susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, when inoculated,
it had very low seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: The least was Phalaris omniscia,
an invasive plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see none of the isolates we looked
at significantly decreased seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these isolates were, species were
highly virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pythium volutum, Pythium phragmitis,
you can see that pretty much across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board, they decreased seedling survival to
around zero for the plants that we tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas others were occasional pathogens
or maybe very weakly virulent pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as Pythium citrinum right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as Pythium aquatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way to look at that same data,
we'd be spreading it out, just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: two plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a native plant epilobium
glandulosa, the one that I mentioned is
[SPEAKER_00]: really susceptible to these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the invasive Phragmitis in
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And proportioned seedling survival,
Pythium species tested with asterisks for
[SPEAKER_00]: those that significantly decreased
seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedling survival relative to neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see are a lot of asterisks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these interactions are
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those species do significantly decrease
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the range of that is really broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these are just acting as a
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Pythium ingustatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the survival for
epilobium is pretty much zero when
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for Phragmitis, it's very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are having a, that's Pythium
species having a really different effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas others have Pythium dissimili,
it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some, although it's a pathogen for
both, it's a far more virulent pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: for one relative, rather than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at Pythium agumulatum here,
you can see that epilobium glandulosa when
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated has pretty much zero seedling
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Phragmitis, despite the fact that
it's significantly reduced relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral, it's not that virulent of a
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we divide this up by where these
plant species are coming from and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect of all of the Pythium species,
green being native and yellow being
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive, you can see that the proportion
of seedling survival, it isn't clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher for the invasive plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think back to in the earlys,
it would say that these invasive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be less susceptible to
pathogens, and we're not seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most susceptible plant species,
Lithium salicaria, is invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the most resistant,
Phalaris anemesia, is invasive too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not clear-cut divisions between
native and invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take this one step further and look
at individual isolates of a given species
[SPEAKER_00]: that are taken from either the Phragmitis
invaded or non-invaded soils to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: something about Phragmitis being there
makes this more virulent community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did this for, I think,
eight different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing one here, Pythium
atransviridium, but took isolates from
[SPEAKER_00]: both the Phragmitis invaded and
non-invaded range and tested their
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenicity and virulence to a number of
plant species, which are different colors
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green are native, and the yellow
is of the invasive Phragmitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see is that there's not
any big difference between the isolates
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Phragmitis invaded and the
non-invaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respond really similarly for all the
plant species we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not seeing Phragmitis cultivate
an extremely virulent pathogenicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least within species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the fungi, here's another heat map
with the isolate source plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that we're, the seeds that we're
getting these fungi from, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species we tested along here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can again see that Epilobium
blandulosum, that herbaceous native
[SPEAKER_00]: species, is the most susceptible with the
darkest and most red here, the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the least is Mulin barigae glumeraga,
which is a native grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two invasives here, Phragmitis and
Luthrin salicaria, are kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle, and isolates from some plant
species might be slightly more virulent
[SPEAKER_00]: than others, but it's really a mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we again divide this up in the same
way as the previous group with the online
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, and look at those individual fungal
species by these two plant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: Epilobium blandulosum and Phragmitis,
we see similar things that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly reduce survival relative to
the control, but there's a big difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in the virulence, so the degree to which
that negative effect is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most virulent pathogens are these
Fusarium species, no surprises there for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us in the plant pathology
department, as well as some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternarius.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not necessarily a kind of uniform
across species, so this Alternarius
[SPEAKER_00]: species, it significantly reduces seedling
survival for both Epilobium blandulosum
[SPEAKER_00]: and Phragmitis, but that's having a bigger
effect on Epilobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do the same thing and look at the
kind of sum of all of those fungal species
[SPEAKER_00]: by plant species and by plant species
origin, with the native species in green
[SPEAKER_00]: and the invasive in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that again, you're not seeing
clear cut differences between the native
[SPEAKER_00]: and invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these invasives are very
susceptible and others are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the most susceptible is
still Lithrum salicaria, and the least is
[SPEAKER_00]: Phragmitis astralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Phragmitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, getting back to our initial question,
are these omicids and fungi pathogens of
[SPEAKER_00]: marsh plants, and so how virulent are
they?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find a lot of generalist pathogens,
so they decreased seedling survival of a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of plant species, but there were
differences in their virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, when looking at whether native plant
species were more susceptible than
[SPEAKER_00]: invasives, this didn't seem to be true for
some invasive plant species, so not for
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Phalaris hermitacea was pretty
resistant to those fungi omicids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Lithrum salicaria, another invasive,
was highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, the pathogens from the
native species weren't more virulent than
[SPEAKER_00]: those from the invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to summarize, we found that Phragmitis
changes the soil in some way that
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at that further,
we found that that was because of omicids
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungi in Phragmitis condition soil
that were decreasing seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found numerous and abundant omicids and
fungi in these marsh plant soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dominant genera of these were
Pythium alternaria, Foma, and Epicalcum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found different pathogens
associating with different plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how did these fit into those
hypotheses I mentioned initially about how
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive plant species might be
interacting with pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you think back to enemy release,
where part of the reason why an invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would be successful is because it's
leaving behind pathogens in its native
[SPEAKER_00]: range and it's not acquiring them in its
invaded range, we wouldn't expect to have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that invasive species were less
susceptible to pathogens in the invaded
[SPEAKER_00]: range than native plants, and that the
native plants were accumulating more
[SPEAKER_00]: virulent pathogens than the invasive plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to receive this, we differ some
invasive plant species, but not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's not a clear rule that these marsh
developments, that invasive plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: acting one way and native species are
acting another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it does seem to be the case that
Fowlerus franginacea is less susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to these pathogens, but for Phragmitis and
Lithrum salicaria, it doesn't seem to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this also doesn't get into the
question of we're just looking in its
[SPEAKER_00]: invaded range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this doesn't tell us what's happening
in the native ranges of these invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species and what those pathogens
communities look like, but at least it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us a little window onto what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, thinking back to the other
hypothesis I mentioned, that something
[SPEAKER_00]: about the addition of this new plant
species, this invasive plant, is changing
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen community in such a way that
it would decrease the success of native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants spill over or spill back.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, we would have expected that the
pathogen community changes after invasives
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize and that it increases the
abundance or virulence of pathogens after
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, do we see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see that the pathogens seemed to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we looked at the OMIC and Fowler
communities of different plant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were different, but we don't know if
they're necessarily more abundant or more
[SPEAKER_00]: virulent or what's happening with that and
what effects those would have on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that this research lays the
groundwork for more work into what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening in marsh wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know which OMIC and Fowler are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some idea of their host ranges and
their virulence, but I think one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that definitely comes out is that
marsh wetlands are a little different from
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest and grassland systems where
other people have looked at pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: basic plant interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there might be a few
reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when people looked at invasive plants
and grassland and marsh systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to find a really clear divide
between the native plants which behave one
[SPEAKER_00]: way and the invasives that are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're finding that's not the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That each plant species kind of does
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that could be because marsh
wetlands are just different from those
[SPEAKER_00]: other two systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marshes are, even the native species,
tend to be quick colonizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to grow in clonal stands and
they're just different from those species
[SPEAKER_00]: of forest to grassland systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, I think that we found a lot
of generalist pathogens in these soils
[SPEAKER_00]: which might be making it so that there's
less host specific interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen interactions in marsh wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more likely, I think that if people
looked at a broader set of invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species in other systems, forest to
grassland systems, they'd probably find
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That different invasive plants are
benefiting from different interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some may be doing so well because
they're growing really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others may be interacting with soil
pathogen communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can't really make a blanket
statement about how invasives are active
[SPEAKER_00]: and how native are active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to thank everyone who
made this research possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric, thank you so much for being such a
fantastic speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for being such a
fantastic advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have grown from your mentorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where you have to sit with me
because this is an exit seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not a normal seminar, so I get to
thank everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marianne, right there, I don't know what
I'd do without you in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the few people who's as good
in the lab as in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marianne really was essential for a
lot of the, particularly the sequencing
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular work behind this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin, my undergraduate assistant right
there, who is co-writing one of the papers
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be coming from my dissertation with
me and has really been a great help.
[SPEAKER_00]: My committee, Aaron and Allison,
all of my many undergraduate assistants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone from the Vicky and Andrea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my funding from the Atkinson
Center and the New York Sea Grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to give thanks to all of
my colleagues and friends and family for
[SPEAKER_00]: your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that everything from helping me
in the field to listening to my practice
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are my parents there,
my sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can tell you that I have been
very into marshmallows ever since I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is me doing approximately what I'm
still doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not much has changed there,
but I do feel really grateful to have
[SPEAKER_00]: spent the past five and a half years
surrounded by such a great group of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant pathologists, but also friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
