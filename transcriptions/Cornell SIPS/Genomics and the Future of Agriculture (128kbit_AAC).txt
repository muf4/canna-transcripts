[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to get started this
afternoon, even though I know that there
[SPEAKER_03]: will be people coming on in.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many incredible, wonderful,
competing events that are happening over
[SPEAKER_03]: this wonderful reunion weekend that I know
people will be coming in throughout our
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Katherine Bohr.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Ronald P. Lynch Dean of the
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
[SPEAKER_03]: here at Cornell University, and welcome
home to those of you who have traveled to
[SPEAKER_03]: be with us this reunion weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very grateful that you're here,
and we hope that you have a weekend that
[SPEAKER_03]: you will remember long into the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I especially thank you for joining us
here today for our panel presentation that
[SPEAKER_03]: is entitled Genomics and the Future of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to start this afternoon by
giving you a little bit of background on
[SPEAKER_03]: the Liberty Hyde Bailey Lecture Series,
and that is the Liberty Hyde Bailey
[SPEAKER_03]: Lecture Series that we are celebrating
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an annual feature of our reunion
events here in the college.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this event features distinguished
faculty who are working in key priority
[SPEAKER_03]: areas for the college.
[SPEAKER_03]: In previous years, topics have included,
for example, why social media matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have taken a look at the
debate on the role of GMOs in feeding our
[SPEAKER_03]: growing global populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my hope today that this Liberty Hyde
Bailey Lecture will both deepen your
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of genomics and help you see
the future of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And further, we hope that this lecture
today will help demonstrate the impact
[SPEAKER_03]: that the College of Agriculture and Life
Sciences has had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And will continue to have as we look
toward addressing complex global issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's particularly fitting that the name of
this lecture is Liberty Hyde Bailey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Liberty Hyde Bailey was the very first
dean of the College of Agriculture at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you're all aware that the
iconic Bailey Hall right across the street
[SPEAKER_03]: here is named after our first dean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Bailey had many roles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout his lifetime, he was a
botanist, a horticulturalist, he was a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeder, certainly a teacher,
a very successful administrator,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was a lobbyist, a very, very prolific
writer, he was an editor, he was a poet,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was a rural sociologist, he was a
philosopher, he was a traveler,
[SPEAKER_03]: and certainly he was an environmentalist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not in any way an understatement to
say that he single-handedly helped to
[SPEAKER_03]: create the science of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: His tireless lobbying of the New York
State Legislature led to the establishment
[SPEAKER_03]: in 1904 of the New York State College of
Agriculture right here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bailey was an early visionary in terms of
seeing agriculture as an academic
[SPEAKER_03]: discipline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to him, the fundamental purpose of
education was to serve the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he believed that the resolution of
agricultural problems were every bit as
[SPEAKER_03]: important as resolving other cultural,
ethical, and legal issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hence, his bringing agriculture to the
fore as an academic discipline.
[SPEAKER_03]: He led a remarkable life and a remarkable
career.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his influence not only here at Cornell
University continues to resonate to this
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, just like Liberty Hyde Bailey,
today's panelists are pioneers in their
[SPEAKER_03]: fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are they conducting
groundbreaking research, they're also
[SPEAKER_03]: helping to fulfill the College of
Agriculture and Life Sciences' mission of
[SPEAKER_03]: providing knowledge with public purpose to
the people of the state of New York,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the nation, and around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's speakers, Susan McCouch,
Greg Martin, and Jim Geovin, and Noni,
[SPEAKER_03]: are not only pioneers in their field,
they are all former alumni of Liberty Hyde
[SPEAKER_03]: Bailey Professor Emeritus Steve Tanksley's
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Tanksley is a giant in the field of
plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are so honored that Steve is here
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steve, if you'd stand up, that would
really be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Steve Tanksley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve's work in molecular genetics
revolutionized modern plant breeding by
[SPEAKER_03]: creating the first chromosomal maps of
plants and by pioneering genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques that are absolutely essential
to development of new crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: His research paved the way for
improvements in size, nutritional value,
[SPEAKER_03]: and disease resistance of major food
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: His work also helped to lay the foundation
for the breakthrough technology that is
[SPEAKER_03]: known as marker-assisted selection,
which is a critically important tool for
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve did his undergraduate work in
agronomy at Colorado State University,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he earned his PhD from the University
of California Davis, where he worked on
[SPEAKER_03]: rudimentary genetic maps for plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came to Cornell in 1985 as an associate
professor in what was then the Department
[SPEAKER_03]: of Plant Breeding and Biometry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the ensuing decade, he and his team
developed tools that allowed for complete
[SPEAKER_03]: mapping of the tomato genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 1997, he spearheaded the Cornell
Genomics Initiative, which coordinated way
[SPEAKER_03]: more than 50 faculty members from more
than 20 departments across the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: university to help develop synergies that
were based on the university's strengths
[SPEAKER_03]: in the life sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve was elected to the National Academy
of Sciences in 1995.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Royal Society of London in 2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was appointed the Einstein
Professor of the Chinese Academy of
[SPEAKER_03]: Sciences in 2006.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve retired from Cornell in 2010 to work
at Nature Source Genetics, which is an
[SPEAKER_03]: Ithaca bioinformatics company that he
founded in 2006.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to all of the other
achievements that I've already mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve won the Alexander von Humboldt
Foundation Award, the Martin Gibbs Medal
[SPEAKER_03]: of the American Society of Plant
Physiology, Israel's Wolf Foundation Prize
[SPEAKER_03]: in Agriculture, the Rank Prize,
and the Kumho Award in Plant Molecular
[SPEAKER_03]: Biology and Technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year, he was awarded the Japan
Prize, which honors scientists,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is in quotes, whose original and
outstanding achievements are not only
[SPEAKER_03]: scientifically impressive, but have also
served to promote peace and prosperity for
[SPEAKER_03]: all mankind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve was one of two honorees that were
honored this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve not only had the vision to transform
the whole field of plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: his legacy also includes mentoring the
next generation of groundbreaking plant
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists here at Cornell, and building
the university into a world leader in
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's something that you may not
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, by U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: News and World Report, Cornell University
is ranked number one in the world in plant
[SPEAKER_03]: sciences, and to a very large extent,
that is the legacy of Steve Tanksley and
[SPEAKER_03]: his team.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an incredible accomplishment for
Cornell University, and thank you for
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, building on Steve Tanksley's
legacy here at Cornell, I'd now like to
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce today's panelists, and they'll
come up one by one to give their
[SPEAKER_03]: presentations, and then when they're
finished with the presentations,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll all be seated here at the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, I'll talk a little bit about
each panelist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll invite Susan up to give the
first presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll start with Susan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Professor Susan McCooch is one of the
world's foremost experts on rice and rice
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: She received her BA from Smith College,
her MS from the University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts, and her PhD from Cornell in
1990, during which time she worked in
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: She spent five years with the
International Rice Research Institute in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Philippines before joining our faculty
here at Cornell in 1995.
[SPEAKER_03]: Susan's research into the genomic
variations of different varieties of rice
[SPEAKER_03]: has led to the development of new rice
strains that are more pest and drought
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant, and that provide higher yields
for farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very importantly, Susan's work has
created a more stable global supply of
[SPEAKER_03]: this essential food source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next speaker will be Greg Martin,
and Greg is a professor of plant pathology
[SPEAKER_03]: and plant microbiology, and he is an
expert on tomato disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 2005, he has been the Boyce Schulze
Downey Professor at the Boyce Thompson
[SPEAKER_03]: Institute for Plant Science here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg received his BS, his MS, and PhD from
Michigan State University, and he was a
[SPEAKER_03]: National Science Foundation postdoctoral
fellow at Cornell from 1989 to 1992,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was as postdoc that Greg worked in
Steve Tangsley's laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg's research focuses on the mechanisms
that bacteria use to infect plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: and in turn, the mechanisms that plants
have evolved to interfere with the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our third speaker this afternoon is Jim
Giovinone, and he is an adjunct professor
[SPEAKER_03]: of plant biology in the School of
Integrative Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a research scientist for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Agriculture Agricultural
Research Service, and he's a professor at
[SPEAKER_03]: the Boyce Thompson Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim earned his PhD in molecular and
physiological plant biology at the
[SPEAKER_03]: University of California, Berkeley in
1990, and that was followed by two years
[SPEAKER_03]: as postdoctoral researcher in Steve's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see how this all connects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim was recently elected to the National
Academy of Sciences, and let's give him a
[SPEAKER_03]: round of applause for that incredible
accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim's research focus is on the molecular
and genetic analysis of fruit ripening and
[SPEAKER_03]: the consequences of those effects on
ripening on nutritional quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm going to turn the podium over
to Susan McCooch, and Susan, if you would
[SPEAKER_03]: join me up here, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a pleasure to be here,
and this is, of course, honoring Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a rare opportunity that we get,
actually, to tell somebody who has
[SPEAKER_06]: influenced our lives so deeply how much we
appreciate what they pass on, and I think
[SPEAKER_06]: we all know the importance of a professor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it also resonates back to each of us as
professors hoping to influence another
[SPEAKER_06]: generation of students.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the Steve Tanksley I knew in
1986 when I joined his lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in 418 Bradfield Hall in the
Department of Plant Breeding and Biometry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve arrived at Cornell with big visions
of what molecular genetics could do for
[SPEAKER_06]: plant breeding, for agriculture,
and for global food security.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in 1986, the world faced many of the
same grand global challenges that we face
[SPEAKER_06]: today, although I think the understanding
of what global climate change would
[SPEAKER_06]: represent had not yet become embedded in
our minds.
[SPEAKER_06]: In any case, Steve was bringing new tools
and a new vision to the Department of
Plant Breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that was a great opportunity
for me to explore the field of plant
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding and biometry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And molecular markers would revolutionize
the field of plant breeding and of
[SPEAKER_06]: molecular genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Particularly interesting to me was that it
had immediate application in the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity to translate the discoveries
that were being made in some of the basic
[SPEAKER_06]: sciences into important products in
agriculture, medicine, and environmental
[SPEAKER_06]: science.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, this was music to my ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a background in history and
literature.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was coming from a liberal arts
background.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had lived and worked extensively in the
developing world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And during my first few weeks in the
Tanksley lab, I quickly realized that I
[SPEAKER_06]: was going to have to learn an entirely new
language.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of the most exciting periods of
my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I joined the team working to create the
first molecular map of rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with funding from the Rockefeller
Foundation's program on international rice
[SPEAKER_06]: biotechnology, I joined two colleagues,
Zhenyuan Wang and Zhihong Yu, who were
[SPEAKER_06]: recently emerged from the Cultural
Revolution in China.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was among the first wave of
scientists to come out of China.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were very excited to have them in
the lab working on the development of the
[SPEAKER_06]: rice map.
[SPEAKER_06]: It consisted of 135 RFLP markers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was published in Theoretical and
Applied Genetics in 1988.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I finished my PhD in Steve's lab in
1990, I took a position as a rice breeder
[SPEAKER_06]: at the International Rice Research
Institute in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I worked there for five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: During that time, we established the first
molecular marker lab, which was called the
[SPEAKER_06]: Genome Mapping Lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the foundation for the
application of genomics in breeding at the
[SPEAKER_06]: time, which was all devoted to the concept
of marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lab remains productive to this day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the time I was there,
one of the more exciting aspects of being
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Philippines, other than the fact
that I had the rice paddies right outside
[SPEAKER_06]: my window, was the fact that we had the
gene bank right on campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of the opportunity was to start
to mine that gene bank for natural
[SPEAKER_06]: variation that we could use in breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of the genes that are actually
present in ancient land races and wild
[SPEAKER_06]: species that are housed in the Erie Gene
Bank have now been deployed through the
[SPEAKER_06]: use of this technology, marker-assisted
selection, not GM technology, but actually
[SPEAKER_06]: through back-crossing, have been deployed
to confer heightened levels of disease and
[SPEAKER_06]: insect resistance, drought tolerance,
submergence tolerance, and many other
[SPEAKER_06]: traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those varieties are now planted on
hundreds of thousands of hectares across
[SPEAKER_06]: Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other students in the Tanksley lab built
on the work that we had done in rice,
[SPEAKER_06]: using the rice genome as an anchor to
start to map other related genomes that
[SPEAKER_06]: were larger and more complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first comparative map was the rice
maze map.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see in this diagram,
here we have a rice chromosome in the
[SPEAKER_06]: middle, and we have two corresponding
comparative segments that were conserved
[SPEAKER_06]: in maize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the interesting thing about this is
that rice is a very small genome,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was a fairly conservative and
fairly stable genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it provided a very robust framework for
this comparative mapping to assemble these
[SPEAKER_06]: much more complex genomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it demonstrated that these related
cereals, they went on to develop maps of
[SPEAKER_06]: rice, wheat, and maize, and eventually
many other comparative maps.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these three related cereals,
which are the foundation of the world's
[SPEAKER_06]: food supply, were mosaics of their last
common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they all shared large segments of
chromosomes that were still recognizable
[SPEAKER_06]: after three million years of evolution,
despite being rearranged and reorganized
[SPEAKER_06]: in modern crop genomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who are familiar with
this, it's not surprising today,
[SPEAKER_06]: but at the time it was really a very
profound strategic concept that started to
[SPEAKER_06]: inundate the field of molecular biology
and molecular genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these comparative maps had enormous
implications for application in both
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture and medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of its small size, the rice genome
was also the first crop to be fully
[SPEAKER_06]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it provided a scaffold that allowed us
to more easily assemble the more complex
[SPEAKER_06]: maize and wheat genomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, maize is six times larger than rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the size of the human genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a slow and difficult process to
assemble the genome sequence of maize.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even more difficult was wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hexyploid wheat is 30 times the size of
the maize genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was only just recently completed in
2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: In any case, the comparative maps laid the
foundation for this major accomplishment
[SPEAKER_06]: in the field of the plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I might say also paved the way for my
return from Erie to join the Cornell
[SPEAKER_06]: faculty in 1995.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it had not been that rice was
the foundation for the more important
[SPEAKER_06]: crops in the West, nobody would have
thought of investing a faculty position in
[SPEAKER_06]: a person who would devote their life to
rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: In any case, with so much attention
focused on genotyping and sequencing of
[SPEAKER_06]: genomes, people sometimes seem to forget
the reason for doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the creativity and effort that would
be needed to translate that sequence into
[SPEAKER_06]: products that would ultimately impact the
human lives around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I returned to join the faculty in
1995.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by 1995, things were starting to get
underway at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many people were involved in aspects of
genomics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everyone did it in their own lab,
buying their own machines, working
[SPEAKER_06]: independently, and often having to learn
very difficult lessons, each one on their
[SPEAKER_06]: own.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was no forum for sharing
information and technology across the
[SPEAKER_06]: campus the way there is today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Steve at that time had started to
think about what the implications of the
[SPEAKER_06]: discoveries in the basic sciences meant
for institutions and institutional
[SPEAKER_06]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to quote to you some,
actually I took this off of an overhead
[SPEAKER_06]: slide and I thought of coming in and
putting up the overhead projector so that
[SPEAKER_06]: you could actually see I still have these
slides in my vast repertoire of old
[SPEAKER_06]: papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these were some of the insights that
Steve shared with many of us at that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The DNA sequence will soon be known for
most major life forms, not just for the
[SPEAKER_06]: major species, but for most major life
forms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And biology will move from being an
information limited science to a science
[SPEAKER_06]: that is limited only by our ability to
organize and analyze information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today we live in the era of big data
and digital information and we all know
[SPEAKER_06]: what a burden it is to have an overload of
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Biological research will shift from a
reductionist to a synthesis approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it has dramatically shifted from
dissecting complex genomes to predicting
[SPEAKER_06]: and synthesizing future outcomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: More basic discoveries will emerge from
biology in the next 30 years than from any
[SPEAKER_06]: other single discipline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I joined Steve's lab in 1986 and
here we are 30 years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say we've had a pretty good ride.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Steve's one of the most lasting
contributions that Steve made to the
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornell research community was his
unswerving support and leadership of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornell genomics initiative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under this initiative, we would initiate a
new campus wide hiring strategy that
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed candidates for faculty positions
to interview with prominent scientists in
[SPEAKER_06]: genomic related fields all across campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would form a set of core facilities
that provides the entire Cornell community
[SPEAKER_06]: and survives to this day with access to
the latest in genomic technologies at a
[SPEAKER_06]: cost that was finally manageable for
Cornell researchers due to the economy of
[SPEAKER_06]: scale that came from uniting the campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And departmental and college boundaries
would be lowered as faculty, staff and
[SPEAKER_06]: students started to get to know each other
through their shared research interests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the kind of consolidation and
interactions that I think Catherine
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioned cut across many, many different
colleges, many different departments and
[SPEAKER_06]: has affected the lives of many people who
were either at Cornell or who were
[SPEAKER_06]: recruited to Cornell under the genomics
initiative.
[SPEAKER_06]: When somebody says to you, well,
you know, what you did for your PhD that
[SPEAKER_06]: took you four years, and was 135 markers
on a map is going to be done in 10
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few years later, you kind of look back
at your thesis and you think, wow,
[SPEAKER_06]: those were a lot of late nights in the
lab, manually running gels and waiting for
[SPEAKER_06]: things and turning them around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I can say is that it was hard to
imagine what somebody at that time could
[SPEAKER_06]: have foreseen when we talked about being
in a data rich environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But indeed, I just want to end by saying
that currently the largest project in my
[SPEAKER_06]: portfolio is called the Gobi Project,
the Genomics and Open Source Breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: Informatics Initiative.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a project funded by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are four PIs, principal
investigators, from plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics alone, one from BTI and one from
computer science department.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the objectives of this project are
to program the software that is needed to
[SPEAKER_06]: facilitate the use of big data in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the goal is to assist breeders in the
public sector working to accelerate the
[SPEAKER_06]: rate of genetic gain for staple food crops
in the developing world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see how this thread has
actually permeated my entire career here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to close by saying that
the Gobi Project encompasses three
[SPEAKER_06]: different international crop improvement
centers, CIMIT in Mexico, ICROSAT in
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexico, and IRRI, ICROSAT in India,
and IRRI in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are three institutions right here in
Ithaca, all of whom have PIs on the table,
[SPEAKER_06]: the USDA, the Cornell, Cornell,
and that's CALS, and BTI.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are addressing simultaneously five
of the world's most important crop
[SPEAKER_06]: species, rice, maize, wheat, sorghum,
and chickpea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, in fact, I think,
a consolidation of the vision that Steve
[SPEAKER_06]: expressed so many years ago just to show
you that Cornell still remains,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, a leader in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am very impressed, Catherine,
by your news today that the plant sciences
[SPEAKER_06]: is ranking so highly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I must say I'm not surprised.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's important for us all to
recognize the excellence that is housed
[SPEAKER_06]: here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I'll close by saying I
think I've done my part to contribute to
[SPEAKER_06]: the next generation as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much, Susan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next, we will hear from Greg Martin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd like to begin just simply by
thanking Steve for his mentorship and for
[SPEAKER_00]: really his friendship over many a long
period of time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was actually also a beneficiary of
the Cornell Genomics Initiative because it
[SPEAKER_00]: provided me an opportunity to return to
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first joined Steve's lab, as Catherine
mentioned, in 1989, which is hard to
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually 27 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, was then able to come
back in 1998, I guess is what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting for me, reflecting
back in that period of time, back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 1980s and the early 1990s,
it turned out to encompass a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting intersection between two
important developments in my field,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, it was the first development
of new experimental systems genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that allow the genetic
characterization of how plants respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the second important
development were the methods of using DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: markers that was spearheaded in Steve's
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two different developments,
again, intersected and allowed then the
[SPEAKER_00]: identifications of genes from plants that
confer disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ended up being the basis of my
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do today is to give you
an overview, a very kind of broad overview
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we've learned in the past 25 years
about plant disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll touch a little bit about how
we can use this knowledge to make better
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, to make plants more disease
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone is a home gardener,
you'll know that plants succumb to all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They attack stems, fruits, leaves,
and not shown on this slide, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, of course, have a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have a huge impact on yield,
but also on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a large farmer, that affects
the marketability of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like this kind of thing,
and I do, they're also really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to study diseases because you can learn a
lot about how the pathogens actually cause
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, how they're able to suppress
defense responses in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aside from the fact that it's just a
lot of interesting biology and has kept my
[SPEAKER_00]: lab occupied for about 25 years,
of course, plants also, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases also have a major impact on
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard for me to see this up
here, but 10% of food production,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's estimated, is lost due to diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to control diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a lot of money and, of course,
involves the application of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been an introduction of
important diseases into the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: that have had a big impact on all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American chestnut tree was lost to an
exotic pathogen that came in, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, we're now currently dealing
with citrus greening, which is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the problem, and it's just like
the problem with superbugs that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: news recently, is that plant pathogens
also evolve very quickly, and they develop
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to different pesticides that
are currently being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good news is that plants actually
have a very effective immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in some ways it's analogous to the
human immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important that some plants
actually have natural disease resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: in the form of certain genes that allow
them to resist infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a simple picture that
makes the point that, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of these plants were inoculated with
the same bacterial pathogen, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that one plant appears to be
completely resistant to the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't show any symptoms,
whereas the other one has really succumbed
[SPEAKER_00]: to this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important point,
is that plants naturally have these genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that confer resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do they come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them have actually come from wild
relatives of tomato, and these were
[SPEAKER_00]: collected back in the late 1950s and early
1960s by Dr. Charles Rick, who is at UC at
[SPEAKER_00]: University of California Davis and was
Steve's PhD advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds of these different wild relatives
were collected and are available now for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to analyze, and that's the sort of work
that we've been doing over the last 10 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years, is screening these to identify
new disease resistance genes that could
[SPEAKER_00]: then be introduced into tomato varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into all the details,
but the main point is that we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of both sort of classical
genes in genetics and classical plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathology, as well as a lot of the more
contemporary genomics technologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to very precisely map a gene on a
particular chromosome, get down to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: fine level, and be able to pick out the
individual gene among the 35,000 or so
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are in tomato, the individual
gene that's important, that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually conferring this disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Susan alluded to already,
this sort of technology has really
[SPEAKER_00]: expedited things.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years ago, when I cloned a resistance
gene, when I was a postdoc in Steve's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: it took four years, and many, many people
working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently cloned a gene, and it took
four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the sort of progress in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to identify these genes much
faster, and of course, that will benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do these resistance genes do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just sort of describe this in a very
simple way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know that resistance genes produce
proteins, and these proteins allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to detect the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathogens produce certain proteins in
their process of infecting the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the process of causing disease,
and these are proteins that resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: genes make, we refer to as receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can act either inside the cell or
outside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they detect a pathogen protein,
it activates the immune response in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and leading to disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really kind of the basic thing
that we've learned in the past 25 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can imagine with so many people
studying it in lots of different labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually know a little bit more than
what I'm showing, and that's illustrated
[SPEAKER_00]: in this slide, and sort of again,
actually a rather simplistic view of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually do know about the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot of different components that
act both in recognizing the pathogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant response, how it actually
resists infection downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each one of these different sort of
items on this slide represents a different
[SPEAKER_00]: potential target that plant breeders can
use to then introduce into new tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the sort of genomics technology that
was pioneered in Steve's lab back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 1980s, plant breeders, in this case
tomato breeders, are using genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies, in particular DNA markers,
to be able to very rapidly breed more
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistant tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm just going to end with
this sort of simple summary slide to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you that diseases, of course, do have a
huge impact both in agricultural settings,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to the impact, the economic
impact on the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of progress in
understanding exactly how the plant immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system works, and that's due to many
different labs and we've been fortunate to
[SPEAKER_00]: have really an excellent level of federal
funding, at least in the past 20 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: so, not as much currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's allowed a lot of progress in
this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I mentioned, the genomics
technologies allow both the detailed study
[SPEAKER_00]: of the immune system, but they also
facilitate the breeding of more disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much, Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we'll hear from Jim Giibinoni.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'd like to, again, thank Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really changed my life and in a very
positive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people have changed it other ways,
but you had a great impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to thank you and Susan
and Greg, because I never get to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: so many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to have a big crowd also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I guess, tell you a
little story about some of our work,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the implications of our work in
fruit development and fruit biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, to really just emphasize
that it all started with coming here to
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell for a postdoc and coming to
Steve's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, as Susan and Greg mentioned,
the technology, the marker technology was
[SPEAKER_01]: being developed and applied to both the
utility and genetic selection for breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes, but also towards understanding
and identifying genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was being used both for practical
and for basic biological purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, the first targets that
Steve was approaching and that Greg
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented was the cloning of the first
disease resistance gene from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that gene had been cloned,
I had met Steve and said, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in fruit and these funny
ripening mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve said, yeah, maybe there's
something about those disease genes that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you come and work on the
fruit genes just in case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the fact is, disease resistance is
much more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never get a fruit if the plant is
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I ended up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a very good thing.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about fruit, we all know that
in meeting our needs for food security,
[SPEAKER_01]: having enough to eat in our state,
in our country, in the world, we often
[SPEAKER_01]: think about yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's another part of that equation,
and Greg alluded to it, and that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: much we can keep, how much we can actually
get to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shelf life, storability, these are all
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds are designed through evolution to
last.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll overwinter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll make it to the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant organs are not necessarily
so designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fruit and vegetable tissues,
tissues of the plant that we consume,
[SPEAKER_01]: often have much more of a problem in terms
of storability, in terms of decay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fruit in particular is an
interesting organ because it's one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: designed through evolution to be eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think about the fact that most of
what a plant is doing, as Greg just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, is defending itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly in this stage of development,
an organ is going just the opposite,
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, come here and get me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consume me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do so, so as to release the seeds,
because a fleshy fruit has really evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: as a means of releasing seeds for the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that process that makes the fruit
attractive, the ripening process,
[SPEAKER_01]: also eventually leads to decay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other part of our equation
in trying to meet our food security needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much can we produce, but also can we
get it to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this process that I've mentioned,
or referred to as ripening, is really the
[SPEAKER_01]: sum of all those activities, the
physiological changes, the biochemical
[SPEAKER_01]: changes, that sum together to make the
fruit attractive to some organism that
[SPEAKER_01]: will consume it and liberate the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if it doesn't come along,
plan B is become susceptible to things
[SPEAKER_01]: that will rot the fruit and let those
seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get high quality and something
desirable to eat without getting into that
[SPEAKER_01]: later phase of what's referred to as over
ripening and eventually decay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So fruits do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't all do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They accumulate different pigments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some get soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't get soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have many of the similar
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they generally accumulate sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They generally produce volatile compounds,
often compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are what give fruits their
characteristic aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're attractants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smell nice to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're often derived from necessary
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're also signals that there is
quality there beyond just something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fun to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually going to be good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, again, typically accumulate
pigments, but different pathways and
[SPEAKER_01]: different fruits are activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nutritional content often changes in
the fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, as noted in the corner,
eventually they rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all part of the same developmental
process, the same genetically controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this is going on as the fruit
reaches that stage of maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the challenge is how do we get
it to the consumer without losing too much
[SPEAKER_01]: of the crop to decay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put a lot of money into this,
a lot of energy, a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hold things in modified atmosphere
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an apple shed in the Pacific
Northwest where fruit are held in modified
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 and oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at low temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows us to keep them for nine
months beyond harvest and get them to
[SPEAKER_01]: market virtually all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in certain parts of the world,
often the resources are not available or
[SPEAKER_01]: the means for sustaining quality product
is not necessarily there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy is not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we lose a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we lose the most in the parts of the
world where we need that food the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a challenge to address this
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it begins with us for really
understanding the basic biology of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do this in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, because really in Steve's lab,
so much was developed in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular resources, things like the
genetic maps, eventually the DNA sequence
[SPEAKER_01]: that Steve really championed the
sequencing effort in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of other attributes of those
of you who grow tomatoes in your backyard
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can grow tomatoes without killing
them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's an important crop,
breeders have collected a lot of the type
[SPEAKER_01]: of genetic diversity of wild species that
Greg mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just a lot of mutants because
they see interesting things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put them into the seed storage banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of genetic material that
we can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: To ask questions about plant biology and
particularly the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned the sequencing effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to highlight this for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, this was really Steve's
vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got together the group that started
the sequencing effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, tomato is not a crop
that is that important anywhere for
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody to be able to do it by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he organized an international
consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tackled this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all the tomatoes represent the
countries where there was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with a white paper that Steve
organized that everybody submitted to
[SPEAKER_01]: their respective governments got money to
bring about this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many other countries who didn't have
funded grants also participated as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: was really the lead group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve is biggest here not because he
has the biggest head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because he had the biggest impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I point out with this slide,
these are all the groups in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the people here are people
that either worked with or were students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Zach Lippman, one of Steve's former
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy Patterson, another former student.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rod Wing, a former postdoc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the people who were working on
this project as faculty had come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's lab earlier on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sequence was important not just
because tomatoes are important but because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's closely related to a lot of other
important fruit and vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potato, eggplant, pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You combine those tomato and you really
have the most important fruit and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crops in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even coffee is not so distantly
related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Susan showed you a while ago the
comparative maps between the cereals that
[SPEAKER_01]: were done with rice and maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Steve had also done this between
tomato and coffee, demonstrating that
[SPEAKER_01]: these genomes are not that different and
that you can use one genome to make
[SPEAKER_01]: inferences about the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the real great impacts of Steve's
vision and his leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll spend a few more minutes now kind
of coming back to some of the things I did
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it in the context of how I ended
up here at Cornell also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my PhD at UC Berkeley in the late
1980s and I was working on a gene in
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato called polygalacteronase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's referred to up here with the
PG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polygalacteronase becomes very highly
expressed in the ripening fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the predominant protein in the cell
walls of the fruit as they mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it breaks down the
pectin in between the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of a brick wall and if all the
mortar started liquefying, that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: polygalacteronase is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polygalacteronase does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was thought that that caused the fruit
to soften.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a company you may have heard of
called Calgene said let's make a
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically engineered tomato that won't
soften.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll last longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can leave it on the vine longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll taste better because we don't have
to harvest it too early just so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can ship it across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume probably many of you have
heard of the flavor saver tomato and
[SPEAKER_01]: Calgene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first GM crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing my PhD and it was actually
to test the function of that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my PhD was that's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was express that we did the
opposite experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We over expressed it in a hard green fruit
and said does it get soft?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer was no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard green fruit we used were a
mutation called the RIN mutation or
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening inhibitor that actually arose
spontaneously here on the Cornell campus
[SPEAKER_01]: in Henry Munger's greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Henry Munger, former alum and also a
faculty for nearly 40 years, passed away
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, was in the plant breeding
department here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this mutation arose spontaneously in
his greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit do not ripen at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That let me test that hypothesis,
but it also made me much more interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in well what's wrong with this fruit that
it won't ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what led me to Steve's lab
because he was pioneering the technology
[SPEAKER_01]: that allowed one to go from a phenotype to
the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gene that underlies that defect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I was here in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually in the same aisle as Greg
Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were bouncing into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as much as we would now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was much smaller then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still did once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the RIN mutation, what I just showed
you, and you can see again here,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a homozygous mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruit never ripens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a pretty serious defect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually has practical utility,
a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used very widely and commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial tomatoes as a heterozygote,
where you now get a long shelf life,
[SPEAKER_01]: slow ripening tomato that nobody likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes never taste as good as they do
when I grow them in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one main reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do have long shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ship them across the country
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really partly because we haven't
focused too much on the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We primarily focus on making sure we can
produce the crop and get it to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the breeders now,
are focusing back on the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, our interest was this must be
something really important if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: alter this single gene and have such a big
impact on the ripening of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in our lab and work, I started in
Steve's lab and then completed a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: We identified the underlying gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a master regulator of other genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it basically, we know now,
controls almost every gene that we know is
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in ripening or has a change of
expression in ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gene sits on its promoter and
influences its expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a key regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many other interesting tomato
fruit mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And implementing the same kinds of
positional cloning technologies that Greg
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier, we've identified many
of those genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, virtually every important or
major effect mutation in tomato has now
[SPEAKER_01]: been cloned either by our group or in
collaboration with others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Julia Vrebalov, who did a lot of this
work, is a former Cornell alum.
[SPEAKER_01]: She received her PhD here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the interesting things we've
done is once we had this gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: we asked, well, is this just tomato?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it other species?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know now, working with a number of
collaborators, generating knockouts in
[SPEAKER_01]: this gene through GMOs in banana and melon
and strawberry, that this gene's very well
[SPEAKER_01]: conserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you alter its expression,
you alter the ripening of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very basic regulator of
ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very well conserved through
evolution regulator of ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in controlling
shelf life, variation in a gene like this
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably one you should be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, there are a lot of other
interesting mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just point out one here that we've
identified the gene for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another Cornell alum, Kong Wen,
did his PhD on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a gene called uniform ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a wild type, non-mutant tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this kind of green shoulder on the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most tomatoes you'll find in the
supermarket carry the uniform ripening
[SPEAKER_01]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're uniform in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they ripen, they'll be uniform red.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older varieties, and you know if
you're interested in heirloom tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: one marker of an heirloom is if they have
the green shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's thought that that's not a nice
appearance, so it's been bred out using
[SPEAKER_01]: the uniform mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we know now is this is another
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That greenness up here is, of course,
due to chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you remove that, you have less
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up with less sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have less chloroplasts, so you also
get less carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have probably a less
nutritious fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an unintended consequence,
and we understand this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can probably do things about that
because of that knowledge to bring back
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Greg mentioned, we're also using
genetic diversity now to look at,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically to identify additional genes for
which we don't have mutations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for which there is diversity in the
wild germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just an example of a
population that was developed largely
[SPEAKER_01]: using the marker technology that Steve had
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also developed some of these
populations in his work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're just looking, we're interested
in the nutritional quality, and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: main attributes of that in tomato is the
carotenoids, lycopene, beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives them their typical
orange-reddish colors, and I think you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see just looking over this slide there's a
lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we extract those and measure them and
just plot the different compounds across
[SPEAKER_01]: the different lines, you can see a lot of
variation in different nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using that now to map new loci
and identify new genes that regulate this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular pathway and the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this was another Cornell alum,
Ryan McQuinn, who received his PhD here
[SPEAKER_01]: just last year, who did a lot of this
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I'd end, if I have a minute
to end, with just one last slide about who
[SPEAKER_01]: are our greatest faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we can replace this word
here with Steve Tanksley, these two words.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he fits all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't coordinate, but you heard a
lot of these words from Susan,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the dean, from Greg earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to see we're all thinking of
the same things when we're thinking of
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: An educator, an innovator, not just in
science, but also in the university
[SPEAKER_01]: community and how science is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vision to see things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Susan showed that very well with
her slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we were sitting here
running gels, it was hard, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly for me to imagine where we would
be now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Steve saw that coming and
helped bring us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that leadership as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing, I think,
is still a human being in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very compassionate person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, sometimes, he helps keep you out
of jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll tell you a little story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as bad as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was a postdoc here,
I was out in the field in Varna,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where Varna is down 366.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve had his tomato fields there,
and it was a Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was out with another postdoc,
Rod Wing, and we were harvesting tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: from our crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these wild species crosses,
they make little tiny tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along came a Cornell University police
officer, wondering what we were doing out
[SPEAKER_01]: there on a Saturday morning picking
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought we were stealing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't seem to buy the fact that across
directly 12 feet away from us was Martha
[SPEAKER_01]: Muchler's field for breeding tomatoes that
had these big, beautiful tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had all these little tiny orange
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gave us a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the kind of test you see here,
but he, it turned out, was a recent
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell grad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave us a plant physiology test in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't believe it, and the funniest
thing was both Rod and I were,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He started asking us about photosynthesis,
about hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had taken a hormone from Peter Davies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very excited young police officer,
and after that, we told Steve,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course we tried calling Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no cell phones in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was calling into the police station
to call Steve in the lab who was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we couldn't get rescued by Steve,
but after that we always carried a letter
[SPEAKER_01]: from Steve out in the field saying we
actually worked from him and we were not
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will end there and just thank again
all of you for coming today, and thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve for so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now if I could ask Susan and Greg to
please join us all up on the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going, I have a series of questions
that I'll be asking our panelists,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I'll open up the conversation to
everyone who's here today, but I cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you how happy I am to finally learn
the answer to the riddle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why those supermarket tomatoes never taste
as good as the ones you grow yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, RIN, I've got that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's terrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, let's start our conversation
here among our group, and the first
[SPEAKER_03]: question that I'd like to ask our panel
here is, what do you see on the horizon?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the, the number one challenge or
question I'd like to hear from each of you
[SPEAKER_03]: that you see on the horizon that will be
important for plant scientists to research
[SPEAKER_03]: and address in the coming decade?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that I think is
really exciting is how to develop and
[SPEAKER_06]: deploy diversity, meaning genetic
variation in time and space in a way that
[SPEAKER_06]: will help us mitigate the effects of the
variability of the climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can't predict something,
you can't really work with a uniform
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to now reintroduce diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are we going to do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it going to look like, and how are
we going to manage it so that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: actually both productive and appropriate
for the challenges at hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I tried to sort of
illustrate this in my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my field, I think the biggest challenge
is how we're now going to start to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage, really, of what we've learned
over the past 20 or 25 years about the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know about the individual genes,
but we're just at the sort of inflection
[SPEAKER_00]: point of now starting to use those to
improve disease resistance in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned also superbugs in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does happen with plant pathogens,
and we need to be able to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually use multiple resistance genes
in the same variety to be able to thwart
[SPEAKER_00]: the attack of these kind of superbugs that
are always evolving out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess one way I would answer that is
what keeps me up at night, which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: do we do with all the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We generate so much data that we maybe
pick a few cherries from or analyze in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very specific way and extract some nugget
from, but there is so much more potential
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think actually being able to take
advantage of all the data that we generate
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficiently than I know, at least I
do now, I think is one of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges, probably for many groups,
certainly for our group.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is that I think we're all
thinking about that, and we're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that in the types of people we
hire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the typical student, I think,
in the lab is spending half their time at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bench and half their time doing
computational work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are certainly changing how they do
things, but I still look back and see we
[SPEAKER_01]: generate so much that we really just
scrape the surface off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a negative thing, but it's
something certainly we need to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to take better advantage of.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terrific theme in all three of these
is about complexity and the complexity of
[SPEAKER_03]: biological systems and taking advantage of
what we can learn from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So terrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you all are renowned scientists,
and you come from years, in fact,
[SPEAKER_03]: of focusing on scientific questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: As scientists, what would you like the
non-science community to know about plant
[SPEAKER_03]: biology and genomics?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say, if you could distill
it into the most critical thing for
[SPEAKER_03]: non-scientists to wrap their head around,
what would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, it was sort of a
revelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a dinner party two or three years
ago, and somebody asked me what I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and I started talking about the plant
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people just kind of stared at me
blankly because they hadn't really thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about the fact that plants have an immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess that's the one thing I'd
like to be able to communicate to lay
[SPEAKER_00]: people into the public, is that plants do
have an immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of really fascinating aspects
to it, a lot of parallels, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the human immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we learn in plants is,
of course, important for making
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-resistant plants, but it also can
have an impact on how we understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: human immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe one of the most important
things is to just keep in mind how much
[SPEAKER_01]: potential there is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's so easy to go to the
supermarket, and you see an ear of corn or
[SPEAKER_01]: a floret of broccoli, and you think,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much diversity that we
still don't exploit in crop breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many opportunities to bring in
new traits, to bring in more disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, to bring in different fruit
quality, that there's a lot more out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also a lot of people,
when you think about something different,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get asked, are those orange
tomatoes GMOs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how about the yellow ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that is non-GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no GMO tomato out in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all natural genetic diversity
that's being brought into modern breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still just a tiny tip of the
iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of what's potential that's being
exploited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the things that has always
impacted me a lot is to look back at the
[SPEAKER_06]: underlying commonality that all living
things share.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the reason why comparative maps
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the reason why you can take a gene
out of one organism and put it in another.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because fundamentally living things
honestly, at their base genetic level,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're very similar and they function in
very similar ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I wish that the public could
understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're not so different in many ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: We look and appear different and we
emphasize our diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But fundamentally underlying that
diversity is this incredibly common origin
[SPEAKER_06]: that we share.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a very profound thing that
genomics has helped us to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, those were great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, switching just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are the objectives of plant science
research influenced and changing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: context of climate change, in the context
of globalization, population growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how we are going to feed our global
population?
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you see plant science changing
to address these emerging global needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously a really big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of really huge problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the one that I think a lot about,
because it really does impact what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working on, and that is that climate
change is going to have a huge impact
[SPEAKER_00]: actually on diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as the climate changes,
different pathogens are able to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see entirely new
diseases start to develop that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had a problem with in the last 20
or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, these are going to appear in
different, further north than they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: and further south in different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be a huge problem going
forward and it's due to climate change.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can already see an emphasis on
local production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that the return to thinking
about being locally a little bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: self-sufficient and less dependent on some
grand scale is very important in the face
[SPEAKER_06]: of both population pressure, climate
change, and also our appreciation of the
[SPEAKER_06]: varying interests and, let's say,
preferences that different consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: communities have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's both out of interest for the
diversity and it's also out of,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, a need to find a system that has
both a local as well as a more global
[SPEAKER_06]: content that I think that emphasis is a
growing one and one that's quite healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: for us to have a much more direct
connection to our food supply,
[SPEAKER_06]: our water supply, and the sources of
things that we need to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my colleagues have covered these
big topics very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll focus a little bit on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you see certainly the effects
of globalization, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get summer fruits all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now because they come from someone else's
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're different, often different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing in different growing
regions, maybe different climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not necessarily the same
varieties you would be seeing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer here, say, if you're looking at
peaches or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from that perspective, there's
certainly a lot more opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more things that maybe we
didn't have not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, there are the
challenges of growing just a narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: selection of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we probably often appreciate that
there isn't the quality you get when you
[SPEAKER_01]: have something locally grown because
you're dealing with all the realities of
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping and transport and storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hard to get that same quality
that you can get from something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fully matured on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is close by and then picked the day
before and brought to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the end, I think what all
this represents is just a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for plant scientists like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we understand better the
biology of these systems, we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand which of these issues we can
actually do something about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are going to be more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which maybe there is no really good
solution right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think these big issues are impacting
all of us and we think about them all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time in our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do certainly change how we focus
our research and certainly where the money
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from to do our research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now this is your cue.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last question coming from me
before we open up the conversation to the
[SPEAKER_03]: audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's intentionally meant to be
provocative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, how do you see GMOs fitting
into the current research arena in the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant sciences?
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell us if you see alternatives
perhaps to the strategy for creating plant
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that we will need to address
some of the issues that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: discussing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well my research has taken tremendous
advantage of GMO technology over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have done many of the
experiments that we have done without GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously commercialization using GMO
technology has met a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance from the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news there is that there is a
new technology available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being referred to as genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be hearing about it on the news
and in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is a new technology that so
far is not being considered GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really isn't a genetic or GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fit that definition of GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows a very precise change to be
made in a plant genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the good news is that it looks like
this is not going to have as much
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation and hopefully not as much
concern on the part of the public in its
[SPEAKER_00]: use and it will be more, it will be used
more widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, yeah, just kind of jumping to the
microphone because I think in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways the path that some of the work we do
and Greg does is similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We identify genes that we think are
responsible for a process and we often
[SPEAKER_01]: test that function in a GMO plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We alter its expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We over express it and we ask does it
change the trait that we think it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a research tool it's certainly
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again as Greg mentioned there's been a
lot of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know something like tomato after
flavor saver it's been 25 years there
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't been another GMO tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are new technologies and I think
also with more appreciation and more
[SPEAKER_01]: exploitation of available genetic
diversity there's more opportunities for
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions that don't necessarily
necessitate a GMO approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I think practically that's probably
where a lot of the seed companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can solve this problem by using
available genetic diversity why get into
[SPEAKER_01]: the storm of GMO controversy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the underlying reasons why
GM technology is so considered so
[SPEAKER_06]: essential in some of the big ag
applications is because it's easy to
[SPEAKER_06]: patent because you can see it,
because you can prove it, because you can
[SPEAKER_06]: prove it's yours, okay, so you can defend
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting about the new
technology is that as Greg started to say
[SPEAKER_06]: you can do something very precisely and it
leaves no trace, no footprint,
[SPEAKER_06]: no fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would look just like nature does it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a mutation exactly like what nature
does.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what's interesting is will the
public now that the human can do what
[SPEAKER_06]: nature has done before will the human find
that acceptable or if the intervention of
[SPEAKER_06]: the human not the thing itself but the
intervention of the human is the thing the
[SPEAKER_06]: public objects to will that then be the
grounds for further rejection but what if
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't prove it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're entering a whole new terrain I
think of really complicated concepts about
[SPEAKER_06]: ownership and the defense of patents if
this new technology leaves no footprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say that I think it's both an
opportunity and it's very terrifying at
[SPEAKER_06]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we should all be quite
thoughtful about what it is that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: willing to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet at the same time I think if you're
the one who's faced with the Zika virus or
[SPEAKER_06]: you're the one who's faced with a malaria
epidemic that can no longer be treated by
[SPEAKER_06]: any antibiotic or there's no medicine to
treat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could treat something would you
just sit down and let that microbial
[SPEAKER_06]: population overtake your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just feel like we're at the moment of
real ethical turning points and it's gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: take, it's not about whether it's good or
bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just gonna take a lot of real thought
on the part of many, many people to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand when and how and under what
conditions we use the technology that the
[SPEAKER_06]: human being is endowed by nature to be
able to conceive of and develop because
[SPEAKER_06]: that's who we are too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway I find it to be worthy of great
thought and I'm not ready to say it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: brave new world or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I think we're at the, we're
entering into some very unknown territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very profound and at this moment
I'd like to open to the floor further
[SPEAKER_03]: questions that you might have and I think
our panelists might be willing to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: after for a little bit if you would prefer
to do one on one conversations for a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have our first question here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes I've been confused about the uproar
over GMOs because I've always thought it
[SPEAKER_05]: was a great idea but it appears that the
objection relates more to the kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: chemicals that have been the Monsanto
curse I guess and that the people are
[SPEAKER_05]: afraid that all of this auxiliary stuff
that's going on is polluting the
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetables that we're eating and the crops
and I thought well this is a wonderful
[SPEAKER_05]: time to ask this question because I've
been very curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always thought the GMO approach was
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe somebody can explain to me why
there's such fear and desperation about
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I think you sort of put your finger
on it there is that the first really sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of commercially successful use of the
technology was for herbicide resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and that did sort of, it was associated
then with more herbicide use which was
[SPEAKER_00]: really effective in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers accepted the technology the
sort of downside of that was that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was then a lot more regulations that
occurred around the technology and this
[SPEAKER_00]: partly relates to the public concern about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there became more and more regulations
and it actually prevented more widespread
[SPEAKER_00]: use of the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sort of counterintuitive but it
became so expensive to regulate crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were very few companies that could
actually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know Monsanto of course was one of
those companies that were able to deploy
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology and it sort of stained the
use of the technology I think in the minds
[SPEAKER_00]: of the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happened that that was the
first use of the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it had been used for proving disease
resistance or a number of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: improving nutrition of crops and there
were subsequent uses of it for those
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes it just might have been
completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually let me just add to that I think
the other big use of GM early on was
[SPEAKER_06]: insect resistance in the form of BT and
the impact globally has been to reduce the
[SPEAKER_06]: use of pesticides by somewhere between 20
and 25 and 50 percent depending on the
[SPEAKER_06]: crop and the region.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the use of GM technology has actually
improved environmental quality and the
[SPEAKER_06]: lives of many, many, many, many,
many millions of farmers around the world,
[SPEAKER_06]: many small farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact just in case you don't know the
average size of the farm using BT,
[SPEAKER_06]: BT cotton today is less than a hectare of
land.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a huge mythology out there
that's only the big farmers that benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the truth but it is in fact the
mythology and now I think it's so
[SPEAKER_06]: confusing in people's minds between the
use of glyphosate and then this
[SPEAKER_06]: alternative that it's not one in the same
thing and so if you had to somehow create
[SPEAKER_06]: one monolithic understanding it's very
confusing because it's not one thing or
[SPEAKER_06]: the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends where and how and who.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like any other form of intervention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much is not good but we're at that
point where I think it's been very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very, very confusing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think part of the problem is that this
extends beyond plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get this Frankenstein element of well
we're introducing different species and
[SPEAKER_04]: mixing with humans and we're modifying DNA
and so forth and part of this goes well
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond the plant development to concerns
about what the limits of science are in
[SPEAKER_04]: areas that directly relate to human
development and so forth and some of that
[SPEAKER_04]: fear of the Frankenstein element is coming
into the area of plants and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean actually the technology is applied
to all forms of life but so far we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: apply GM to human but we do apply it to
try to improve human quality of human life
[SPEAKER_06]: in different arenas including probably
most of the medications you take today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't chew on the bark of the willow
tree to get our aspirin.
[SPEAKER_06]: If any of you are diabetic and you have to
take insulin it's GM insulin so we forget
[SPEAKER_06]: how many of the things that we think are
fine are GM technology as well but I agree
[SPEAKER_06]: with you that is the confusion and I think
it has implications for we have an
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding that life was natural before
GM which is another one of those bizarre
[SPEAKER_06]: concepts that we've.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me that the known genetic
diversity among all the major crops and
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that each of them is susceptible
to different pathogens that have host
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity, is it possible, this is
thinking 10 years from now, or 20 to use
[SPEAKER_02]: that information from one main cultivar
like wheat to use genes that confer
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance to put them into corn to confer
resistance to pathogens that now can't
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize that because the pathogens of
corn have never interacted with wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: genes or whatever the products of wheat
genes in a very diverse way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me this understanding of all
the diversity and then making use of that
[SPEAKER_02]: in a global way could really arrest some
of the problems that we have with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability of microbes to become adaptable to
now infect the resistant cultivar four,
[SPEAKER_02]: five, six years down as the way we have
with rust variants in wheat for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact it's not even 10 years from now
that actually has already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are examples where a gene has
been identified in a mustard plant and was
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato in this case didn't have any
genetic resistance to a certain disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can't cross a mustard plant
in a tomato plant so they were able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO technology to move the gene from
mustard to tomato and it gave really
[SPEAKER_00]: effective resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other examples too where.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has not been commercialized yet but
it's being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happened, the paper was published a
couple of years ago and there's many other
[SPEAKER_00]: examples in the literature of moving gene
from rice to corn and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technology is available there
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the main holdup has again been
the acceptance or lack of acceptance of
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: My second question is really directed to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants have quite good innate immune
mechanisms but not acquired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there any way to introduce into
plants an ability to learn from the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and even transfer that immunity
to the seeds so that in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: generation, I mean that there's some
resistance that gets conveyed through the
[SPEAKER_02]: germ plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we do view plants having an innate
immune system just the way that humans do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't rely on antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But humans also have this sort of system
that basically like plants, every cell
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be able to respond to a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, I mean that is acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evolve over a longer period of time
but plants don't have antibodies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of they meet an entirely new
pathogen and acquire that and it's passed
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with some of the big ag growers and
processors and mostly in product
[SPEAKER_08]: development post harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the frustrations I have is
everybody in the production business and
[SPEAKER_08]: the marketing business fears getting a
label of oh this is a GMO product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm going to go back to Professor
Giannone's first bullet point on what are
[SPEAKER_08]: the mission and that is to educate and
particularly when it comes to I think some
[SPEAKER_08]: of the hysteria about genetic engineering
is a lack of understanding.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm going to throw it to you to say
what are you doing to educate people?
[SPEAKER_08]: The EU last week cleared GMO crops that
there's no health effect, negative health
[SPEAKER_08]: effects from this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the record and yet they still
oppose it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not allowed to import any GMO
products into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The EU.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what standards would you propose to
demonstrate safety both from a plant side,
[SPEAKER_08]: from a biological side?
[SPEAKER_08]: The bigger issue is other health issues
but is there a standard that would meet
[SPEAKER_08]: your criteria and how are you going to get
that standard out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean I think you hit on a lot of
important observations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly is a big problem in terms
of perception of GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just start first with one
antidote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was at a dinner once in France with
the head of an INRA lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lab that's kind of the
equivalent of a USDA lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a lab that was doing a lot of
GMO qualification.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a lab that was promoting the
positive benefits of GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very aware of the fact and promoted the
fact that there are EU studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's National Academy of Science
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many studies addressing kind of
the inherent risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably design something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you could express something that
will cause an allergy and that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there anything inherent about GMO
technology that is dangerous and many have
[SPEAKER_01]: come to the conclusion that that's not the
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are at the dinner and the wife
of the director who is so positively
[SPEAKER_01]: pro-GMO says I will never touch anything
GMO because I think it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he can't convince his wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people I think are not going to
respond to the logical arguments no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's because this is food,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something we put in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the thing you're going to
be most concerned about before everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the end the best arguments as
has been mentioned before is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: products and you're in that area where the
consumer appreciates the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: GM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's more nutritious, because it
has better quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just right now, I understand I
talk to a lot of the CEO's companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, they just don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be the one to take the
arrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let somebody else do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is a lot of negative
perception and I'm not sure that it's as
[SPEAKER_01]: simple as education.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people you can explain
and they have other agendas, other reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: why they're not interested in maybe
necessarily following the logical
[SPEAKER_01]: arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, and they're not to be too
negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think again, because it is so basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our food is so basic to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably the most risk averse with
that more than many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why people, a lot of people have
a lot of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can't really address that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as Susan alluded to,
it'll be really interesting to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: people respond to the editing technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's very, you know, that we use
mutation breeding all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural variation all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are going to be changes that will be
exactly the same as what you would get
[SPEAKER_01]: through natural variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people going to respond to those as,
okay, yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they still going to say, you
intervened, so therefore it doesn't meet
[SPEAKER_01]: my standard of what I accept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, you'd never see anything
you see practically growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: supermarket in the wild, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the product of manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, the reality still is a lot
of people don't want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My answer is label it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Label it GM now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have done it at the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We pasteurized milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: People hated it at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We labeled it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't label it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like you're trying to hide
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't believe you because you don't
tell them the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell them the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's GM.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll get over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's I wish we would just
label it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would stop everything else and just put
the label on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were speaking earlier about some of
the issues with the Zika virus and malaria
[SPEAKER_09]: that's resistant to a lot of antibiotics
and other drugs as sort of a way that
[SPEAKER_09]: something that unifies people behind some
of the genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was kind of curious about something
such as golden rice where we see like
[SPEAKER_09]: widespread beneficial impact of this
possible variety of rice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you still see a lot of groups such as
Greenpeace like vehemently against these
[SPEAKER_09]: sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the problem of like kind of
implementing these this technology are we
[SPEAKER_09]: looking at like a vocal minority that we
need to like out lobby or something like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this an issue I think maybe about
universities not being able to go to
[SPEAKER_09]: governments or consumers with information
as readily as organizations that aren't
[SPEAKER_09]: governed in the same way that we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm kind of curious like how do you see
us changing the minds of not just
[SPEAKER_09]: consumers who I think are probably a
little bit easier to reach but but the
[SPEAKER_09]: people who are really like affecting
change policy wise on these issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to just say it sounds like you
think golden rice is a product.
[SPEAKER_09]: No no.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it's never it's there is no
golden rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't exist as a product on the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody is eating golden rice anywhere in
the world right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why hasn't it gone out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many reasons probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I know some reasons but I think
you're my my my my thought is that there's
[SPEAKER_06]: been a lot of attempt on the part of many
people on all sides of this argument on
[SPEAKER_06]: all sides of the fence to reach policy
makers and to discuss in a logical
[SPEAKER_06]: scientific way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually agree with Jim.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the fundamental reason that the
scientific arguments the logical the
[SPEAKER_06]: rational don't necessarily convince is
because the objections are not logical
[SPEAKER_06]: rational or scientifically based.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you cannot counteract them with those
kinds of arguments.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have I have an understanding that
actually many I don't know if this is true
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think many having talked to many
people I think many people have a deep
[SPEAKER_06]: seated understanding that comes from Judeo
Christian beliefs that the world was made
[SPEAKER_06]: in God's image and any changes are against
the law of God.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I think evolution is not
taught in some schools.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same fundamental clash of some
very very very basic belief systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not reachable by science or by logic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually believe that that's
underlying a lot of the resistance and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not something that a policy maker can
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something a university class can
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that people maybe the
reason people change is because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: confronted by a greater evil and it forces
them to reconsider their belief systems
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as long as you can hold on to your
belief system I know there's a fundamental
[SPEAKER_06]: deep deep seated belief system that
probably each of us has.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will defend it to the death.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's that that's actually
where you know when Copernicus or any of
[SPEAKER_06]: the great discoveries in science that the
earth revolves around the sun things don't
[SPEAKER_06]: revolve around us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that takes us out of the center
is somehow very threatening.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually believe it's at that level
and that's why it doesn't follow a linear
[SPEAKER_06]: course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never disappoints me when I hear
conversations among Cornellians.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a fabulous session this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank each and every one of you for
joining us for this thoughtful
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation and please join me in
appreciating our panelists this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
you you you
