[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to move into the
meat of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to introduce our first
speaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonia Schloman is the Extension Small
Fruit Specialist at the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she specializes on all berry crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have found her to be a real great
resource because I'm in Eastern New York,
[SPEAKER_04]: right around the Albany area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's wonderful to have somebody of her
expertise that close to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really thank her for being,
she's been an active part of the advisory
[SPEAKER_04]: group for this program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very happy to have her talk about
pollination issues in blueberry
[SPEAKER_04]: production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sonia, hopefully that audio is going
to work just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to actually get off and that way
I won't interfere with your audio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Laura, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's a thumbs up button that
can be used down on the lower left hand of
[SPEAKER_01]: your screen or thumbs down, I guess would
be the other thing you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that, I'm just going to go ahead
and get started and hopefully everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: can hear me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked to present some information
today on pollination issues in commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be talking primarily
about high bush blueberries, although a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the concepts that I'm going to
cover are going to be useful in low bush
[SPEAKER_01]: or wild blueberry production as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to start by just going over a
little bit of information about the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of blueberry flowers because it
helps explain some of the issues that come
[SPEAKER_01]: up with blueberry pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the blueberry flower is considered to
be a flower that's both perfect and
[SPEAKER_01]: complete, which means that it has all of
the necessary parts for pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the calyx, corolla, stamen and
pistil all together in one flower
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, with the blueberry flowers,
the corolla, which is essentially the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower petals that you would find on other
kinds of flowers, are fused.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a tubular structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sticking outside of that tubular
structure is the stigma, which has the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen tube in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pollen needs to land on the end of
that stigma and travel down the tube in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to fertilize the ovules that become
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nectary is also very deep within that
tubular flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the flower petals are fused,
it makes it a little bit challenging for
[SPEAKER_01]: insects to gain access to the nectary and
come in contact with the pollen that's on
[SPEAKER_01]: the anthers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see in this picture here,
let's see if I can find my little arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the pollen tubes here are
sticking out outside of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blueberries themselves,
each flower, each ovary, can potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: have 65 ovules in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of pollinating that needs
to happen on each individual flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, each individual bush has many,
many flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see from just this one picture
here, one branch on a blueberry bush has
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a few flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the entire bush, there may be as
many as 2,000 or sometimes more flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a significant challenge for
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when pollination is going on,
if an individual flower is not fully
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated, in other words, not all of the
ovules are fertilized and become viable
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, then that fruit does not develop as
fully as a flower that's completely
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So complete pollination is important for
generating a marketable yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that growers can do in
order to determine whether or not they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting adequate pollination is to
evaluate the pollinating activity during
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom and also do an assessment after
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the weather conditions and other
environmental conditions during bloom are
[SPEAKER_01]: making you suspect that perhaps inadequate
pollination is taking place, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do some visual observations for a
span of time, assessing the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators that are actually entering
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the number of pollinators that
are flying around, but ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: landing on flowers and spending time
visiting individual flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the picture up on the right here sort
of indicates what that would look like
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have to be any specific
species of bee or pollinator, but any type
[SPEAKER_01]: of pollinator that's visiting flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to have a minimum of,
or an average, I'm sorry, of 20
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators in a 10-minute period visiting
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will give you an indication that
enough activity is happening during the
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom period.
[SPEAKER_01]: After bloom, there's also another
assessment that can be done, which
[SPEAKER_01]: involves taking a look at the color of the
corollas that fall to the ground after
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination or after bloom is complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see in this picture here,
many of these individual flowers have
[SPEAKER_01]: fallen off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few still remaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that land on the ground need
to be a bright white in color,
[SPEAKER_01]: not brown or gray or translucent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not fully white in color for
that first 24 hours or so after they land
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ground, it's an indication that
they were not fully pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, at the end of pollination,
after all of the flowers have fallen off,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollinated fruit should swell rapidly,
stay kind of a green color and swell
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture here is a nice one
because it shows the sizing up of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely pollinated fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's one here that didn't get
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be an indication of a
failure to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a high percentage of those
in the clusters of fruit on your blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: bush, you may find that you have
inadequate pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do most commercial blueberry
operations do for pollination?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most of them rely, at least in New
England, I'm not sure if this is true
[SPEAKER_01]: across the country, but in New England
still, most of our commercial blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: operations will rely on honeybees for
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might be hives that they maintain
themselves on the farm, or they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: hired in as a pollination service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we're finding now that many
growers are considering some alternatives
[SPEAKER_01]: to honeybees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk about that in a
little more detail in just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while honeybees are the primary source
of pollination, or what growers rely on in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries, it's important to have an
idea of how many honeybees are needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, we recommend anywhere
from one to three hives per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the range is defined by a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main characteristics is going
to be the varieties of blueberries that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some blueberry varieties are more
attractive to honeybees than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, in New England at least,
most of our blueberry operations have a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty wide range of varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fine-tuning the number of hives based
on varieties that are grown is somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to sort of get a ballpark idea
of what's going to be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another element that's going to define how
many hives you need is going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: population of wild pollinators that you
might have in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just noticing here some comments
about sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, I hope that everybody can hear
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that everyone else can hear as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it looks like it was, it is a little
tiny bit crackly, but basically I would
[SPEAKER_04]: just keep going and I'll let you know if
there's a big crack.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well I can turn my microphone
up a little bit if necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the population of wild
pollinators is going to have an influence
[SPEAKER_01]: on how many hives need to be used to
supplement natural pollination that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in a particular blueberry
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are using honeybees, whether or not
they're hives that you're maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself or bringing in, when you place
them you want to make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: placed in a somewhat sheltered location
away from driving wind and rain and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another important concept is to make sure
that you place them in your blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: field or blueberry planting once bloom has
actually already started.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're placed in the field too soon,
blueberries are not terribly attractive to
[SPEAKER_01]: honeybees because they're a little bit
difficult for honeybees to pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to some other flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they find another nectar source
nearby, whether it's other flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting crops or dandelions or something
else and they orient to those flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time the blueberries begin to
bloom, they may overlook them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may bypass them entirely because
they're already oriented to another flower
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure that when you
bring your bees into the blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: planting, there's an adequate and abundant
source of flowers for them to visit and
[SPEAKER_01]: orient to so that they'll stay in that
planting and not go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also want to make sure that you place
the hives, if possible, in such a location
[SPEAKER_01]: where the entrance can be facing east
which will allow the sunlight to hit it
[SPEAKER_01]: early enough in the day and encourage
early activity of honeybees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a chart that you'll find in one
form or another in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Gary's wonderful newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gives you an idea of the different
varieties and their relative
[SPEAKER_01]: attractiveness to honeybees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you have an abundance of a
certain variety or varieties that tend
[SPEAKER_01]: more to the attractive or to the less
attractive side, it may help you decide
[SPEAKER_01]: how many hives are needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a useful tool, although I haven't
found one recently that has a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: newer varieties on it and perhaps Gary can
help us with that information if he knows
[SPEAKER_01]: where to find a chart that includes newer
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honeybees do have some limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main limitation in recent years has
been the fact that bee colonies have
[SPEAKER_01]: suffered from a number of different
diseases and parasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the most notable currently is
what's called colony collapse disorder,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't very well understood yet,
but it certainly is quite pervasive and is
[SPEAKER_01]: really reducing the availability of a lot
of commercial honeybee hives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Varroa mites and tracheal mites have also
been a problem in recent years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of management
strategies that can be used to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Falbrood has been known for quite a long
time and most commercial beekeepers are
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with how to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The net result is that there really are
fewer commercial hives available currently
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's harder to obtain them or contract
to have them brought in to pollinate fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also fewer wild colonies
available so that we really need to start
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about some alternative strategies
to help achieve pollination in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we can do,
and this would be true both for wild and
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic pollinators, honeybees as well as
other pollinating insects, is to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mindful of certain specific
recommendations that we make that have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with insecticide applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most spray guides and pest management
recommendations will very prominently
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend to avoid spraying insecticides
during bloom and this is, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very important practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the event, though, that you find
yourself in a situation where you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to apply something for a
specific pest, that is threatening your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, there are certain considerations to
keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our manuals will include charts
and tables that will list various
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly it's insecticides, but it also
includes some fungicides and herbicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rated in terms of their toxicity
to pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the particular pest that you need to
control, you want to make sure to consult
[SPEAKER_01]: this list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among your options, choose the least toxic
to pollinators if you feel that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply something during bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's not a lot of good
choices available to you, but to the
[SPEAKER_01]: extent possible, it's important to choose
the least toxic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is to make sure to spray
as late in the day as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important because many times
pollinating insects will return to their
[SPEAKER_01]: nests at the end of the day, especially
honey bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to try to make your applications
at a time when they are not out working
[SPEAKER_01]: any flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As late in the day as you can,
this also allows the spray material to dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and be absorbed into the plant tissue
overnight and be less accessible to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators when they resume working in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, to try to use liquid formulations of
materials as opposed to dusts or any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of powdered formulation that's likely to
leave some kind of residue that the bees
[SPEAKER_01]: can pick up when they begin working the
following day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just an example of one of the
lists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're found in many different
guides and recommendation publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some include more materials than others,
a more expanded list.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one that comes out of the New
England Small Fruit Pest Management Guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it gives you an idea of what
category different materials fall in,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the slightly toxic or considered
non-toxic materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other strategy that people can employ
when wanting to get full pollination in
[SPEAKER_01]: their commercial blueberries is the use of
native pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of literature out there,
a lot of different studies being done
[SPEAKER_01]: currently on this topic and some very good
publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best that I came across was a
study that was done at Michigan State that
[SPEAKER_01]: was published this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a three year study, very
comprehensive study at 15 blueberry farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than give you lots of different
charts and graphs and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just kind of cut to the chase and let
you know that what they found was about
[SPEAKER_01]: 112 species of native pollinators that
were active during blueberry bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found 166 altogether, spanning a time
period longer than just the blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom period, but at least 50% of those
112 species were contributing
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly to pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just tells us that we have a very
potent resource out there in our native
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators that we can be taking
advantage of.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these species?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the one that we hear the most
about are bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many native species of
bumblebees across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very effective at pollinating
blueberries, partly because of their size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honeybees, because they're sort of an
in-between size, they're a little bit too
[SPEAKER_01]: big to crawl inside that corolla and
really get a lot of contact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen, but they're also a little bit too
small to reach very effectively all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way in with their mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bumblebees are large enough that they can
reach right in and make a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: contact with the interior of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also do something called sonicating,
which is essentially where they engage
[SPEAKER_01]: their flight muscles without spreading
their wings, and they kind of vibrate when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're working a particular flower,
and it shakes some of the pollen off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the anthers, falls onto their bodies,
and then they can transport that pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: from one flower to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also known for working a lot more
hours in a day than honeybees,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's a real advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll work, for example, in cool,
cloudy conditions where oftentimes we
[SPEAKER_01]: won't see honeybees leaving their hives,
and they're also commercially available,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next sort of big category are the
osmia species.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different osmia bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orchard mason bees, horn-faced bees are a
couple that are commonly referred to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horn-faced bees, for example, have been
used for a long time in Japan for
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, what they found is that it
only requires somewhere from 300 to 800
[SPEAKER_01]: individual horn-faced bees to pollinate an
acre of apples, and this is compared to 60
[SPEAKER_01]: to 120,000 honeybees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that they're very efficient
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They nest in reeds and tubes and holes in
wood pecker holes and insect tunnels that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in decaying wood in the forest
surrounding a blueberry planting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're also commercially available,
so this is a good resource for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another category is the leafcutter bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different species in this
genus as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfalfa leafcutter bees have been used
actually pretty extensively in Maine for
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating wild blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good literature on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're also commercially
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my personal favorites is the shaggy
fuzzyfoot bee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that I've actually seen one
of these, but I like their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also identified as being
significant pollinators of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that they're commercially
available, at least not at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're definitely an important
constituent of the pollinating population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's carpenter bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carpenter bees can be found pollinating or
trying to work blueberry flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look a lot like bumblebees,
except that they don't have that fuzzy
[SPEAKER_01]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lack the fine hairs on their bodies
so that they have a more shiny appearance,
[SPEAKER_01]: but otherwise they're similar in size and
shape to bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do a good job of pollinating
because what they will do is chew holes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of blueberry blossoms,
bypassing the anthers and the pollen tubes
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they cannot actually achieve any
kind of pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not what's considered a good
pollinator, but it's good to know the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference because if you're making
observations in your field, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: know whether what you're counting are
carpenter bees or bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a little diagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here is a carpenter bee that's
working on blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see rather than trying to enter
the flowers that are open, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: chewing into the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll create these little slits on the
side and go right into the nectary and get
[SPEAKER_01]: some nectar out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture here is showing us a number
of different species of bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here across in sort of an arc in the
picture and in the middle is an example of
[SPEAKER_01]: a carpenter bee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it looks rather similar,
but there's this very shiny black abdomen
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes it distinctively different from
the other than the bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that there's a question here
about the number of quads of bumblebees
[SPEAKER_01]: per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that that information is pretty
readily available from the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would sort of hesitate to make a
suggestion right off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that's a piece of information
that's pretty easy to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk just a little bit more
about bumblebees in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with the bumblebees, there's a wide
range of species out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different pictures of a
couple of different species here,
[SPEAKER_01]: both working on blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work on a wide range of conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more effective at reaching into
the flowers and actually achieving
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, they do that sonicating action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial bumblebee hives are pretty
readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the most widely used pollinator
for greenhouse tomatoes, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more and more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hives that are available for interior
locations, like in a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: are usually cardboard boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose these could be used outside if
they're placed inside a shelter of some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort, but I don't think they would hold up
for as long as the ones that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: designed to be outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those types are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I don't have a specific number
of quads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different sizes of boxes that are
designed for different uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, they're pretty readily
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just again, a little review of the osmia
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main blueberry bee, horn-faced bees,
blue orchard bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole publication dedicated to
blue orchard bees that their acronym is
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: They refer to how to raise Bob in fruit
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these will nest in these types of
tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, it would be a bamboo or reed
section of some sort that would be one of
[SPEAKER_01]: their natural sites, but you can construct
one that's equally appealing to them
[SPEAKER_01]: simply by using cardboard tubes similar to
a straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, again, commercially available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of different sites that
sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the work on different designs of
nests was done by Dr. Batra from
[SPEAKER_01]: Beltsville, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe she has left Beltsville now,
and there's another person that has taken
[SPEAKER_01]: over her position there, but there's some
good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is here one of the tubes might look
like inside with the larvae that are
[SPEAKER_01]: packed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This must be a leaf cutter bee of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the little sections of leaves
that are packed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to construct or purchase a box
full of these types of tubes, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: create a shelter for housing them pretty
simply, just basically a trash barrel laid
[SPEAKER_01]: on its side and the tubes inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to put some kind of a screen or
wire mesh around the front of it because
[SPEAKER_01]: various predators like skunks and other
kinds of animals would be attracted to
[SPEAKER_01]: that food source that the larvae present
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to also make sure you have some
ventilation in there and a nice clear area
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of it where the grass doesn't
grow up and obscure the entrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another option is to use a wooden block
and drill holes in the wooden block,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5-16ths or so in size, not too thick,
and you also don't want to drill all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have only one opening in one
end of the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the types of nesting sites that
we actually see somewhat commonly now in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of different fruit plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture here was taken, I believe,
in Ipswich Haverill area in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: a fairly sizable blueberry operation
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them in other locations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty inexpensive, not a big commitment
there to increasing the nesting sites for
[SPEAKER_01]: wild pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to nesting sites, you also
want to try to encourage year-round
[SPEAKER_01]: residents of these insects in your
location by making sure that you have some
[SPEAKER_01]: suitable food sources for them throughout
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birch, maple, oak, poplar, willow,
those are trees that are pretty common,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in New England, as food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also encourage some wild areas
with asters and some other kinds of wild
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering plants rather than mowing
everything, just keeping a few areas where
[SPEAKER_01]: they might find nectar sources in other
times of the year besides when the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries are blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to summarize, the things that you can
do to enhance the suitability of your farm
[SPEAKER_01]: for these beneficial insects, pollinating
insects, is to provide a habitat suitable
[SPEAKER_01]: for nesting, encourage or plant flowering
plants that provide bloom through the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have some clean water,
so they'll need access to clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nest building materials, again,
keeping a few areas that are somewhat wild
[SPEAKER_01]: and allow them to have access to materials
that they need to build the nests with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to minimize your insecticide use
during bloom as much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to add just one slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is something that Gary may
have a lot more information about if we
[SPEAKER_01]: have time for some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what you can do if, even when
you've done all the other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about, you still have poor
pollination in a given year, such as this
[SPEAKER_01]: year, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had very cold, windy, rainy conditions
in many areas during bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, the flowers either don't set
fruit at all or the fruit that they set is
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that people have talked
about doing in conditions like this is
[SPEAKER_01]: using a supplemental plant growth hormone
application, something like gibberellin
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of gibberellin products
that are labeled for use in blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: pro gib and gib grow are a couple that I'm
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be others.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are materials that can be applied to
your blueberries to help retain some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those un-pollinated or what we call
parthenocarpic fruit that have no viable
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds in them, or no pollinated seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for those fruit that have incomplete
pollination, it can help size up those
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: These materials can be applied either in
one spray or in a split application,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually on the order of 80 grams of active
ingredient per acre, towards the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom in a single application or towards
the end of bloom and then again in 14 days
[SPEAKER_01]: after that in a split application.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to have high spray volume
in order to get a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good coverage of the plants with a high
spray volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good if you can to try to apply this
when the drying conditions are slow so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can increase absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: As is true with a number of different
materials to try to use materials to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that your spray water is the correct
pH in order for these materials to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to read some of these
questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The development of wild pollinators such
as wild bumblebees I think is primarily a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of making sure that we have good
nesting sites for them and maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: some good wild areas in the periphery
around the planting in order to allow them
[SPEAKER_01]: to develop some nests and also to get a
good food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question is do the parthenocarpic
fruit have the same quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they're inherently smaller
and I think the flavor is somewhat less
[SPEAKER_01]: but again we don't have many growers or
really any that I'm aware of that have
[SPEAKER_01]: tried using gibberellin in Massachusetts
at least and I'm pretty sure we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: seen much of it in New England but it's
possible that in areas where there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: significant large scale production of
blueberries such as New Jersey or possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan that may be a more common
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be true that Gary has something to
say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last question, if admires use for grub
control in June, yes it could hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: bumblebees and it's going to be important
to use that very carefully and not allow
[SPEAKER_01]: drift into areas outside of the blueberry
planting because most likely the
[SPEAKER_01]: bumblebees are nesting and other natural
pollinators are nesting in areas outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the blueberry planting itself so we
need to be very, very careful about drift
[SPEAKER_01]: with spray materials such as admire that
have a systemic component so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: protect the pollinators and other
beneficial insects in the area around the
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I guess the last question is if
bumblebees are brought in, will they later
[SPEAKER_01]: colonize the area for next year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of direct information
about that and I haven't found it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: studies but my impression from a couple of
growers that I know who've recently kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of adopted bumblebees in favor over the
use of honeybees and are very happy with
[SPEAKER_01]: them have found that there is a certain
percentage of a bumblebee colony that's
[SPEAKER_01]: brought in that will stick around,
that will become a resident population
[SPEAKER_01]: over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be necessary to bring bumblebees in
for a few years before you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate population that's established
that will be reliable for an extended
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time but I do think that they
stick around from year to year is my
[SPEAKER_01]: impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess with that, I think that's all I've
got and I'm going to stay on the line and
[SPEAKER_01]: can take questions or comments from people
if there are any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody else have any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the question about how long is
the blossom viable for pollination?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just answered that, forgive me
because I had someone here talking to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that last question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a little bit of
variation with different varieties but I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say that there's probably a span of
a week to 10 days depending on the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain weather conditions are going to
push the bloom period faster than other
[SPEAKER_01]: weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, when it's sort of cold,
it slows things down a bit as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: if we get a spell where the weather is
very hot and the whole bloom period
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes kind of compressed and goes
through the stages more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think on average we're looking at
something like a week for the availability
[SPEAKER_01]: of pollination for flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonya, that was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anybody has any questions that come
to them while Dr. Pavlis is speaking,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonya will be here at the end and I really
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a few moments here folks and I'm
going to switch things around and
[SPEAKER_04]: introduce our next speaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our next speaker is Dr. Gary Pavlis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a professor and ag agent at Rutgers
University and his areas of expertise are
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry and grape and wine production.
[SPEAKER_04]: His blueberry newsletter, the Blueberry
Bulletin, has an international following
[SPEAKER_04]: and he has done a lot of research,
transformative research on blueberry
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's been instrumental in the
expansion of the New Jersey wine industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have any wine questions after
the blueberry presentation, now we know
[SPEAKER_04]: who to ask them to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm so pleased to have Dr. Gary Pavlis
here to talk to us about blueberry site
[SPEAKER_04]: preparation and fertility considerations.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Gary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a little bit about site
selection and I always put this slide on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's seen me give a talk has seen
this slide, typical harvest in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I always say is, well,
if you don't have a harvest like this
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are, then I guess you need to
listen up because this is what we do in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, sitting in the research
station in New Jersey and looking out my
[SPEAKER_00]: window, it's the pine barrens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what reality is is that if you're
going to grow blueberries, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where high bush blueberries evolved,
this is where and what you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically reproduce if you want to grow
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to recreate our climate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have soils that are very specific for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the pH, organic matter,
water table, all of this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very specific for high bush
blueberries and that's why they do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to grow high bush
blueberries, this is what you are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to recreate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I always put this in front of
anyone that's going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a perennial crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, there's a lot of I's that
need to be dotted and T's that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often tell people that with
something like a perennial crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: this crop is sort of like children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that any mistake you make
today, you will pay for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're getting started,
you have to look at what it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cost from an establishment standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't cut out certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really don't have the money to put
in the irrigation, so I'm not going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit about the cost
a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll mention some things about site
selection and the things that go along
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about varieties, irrigation,
labor, and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get into some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest figures are somewhere around
$8,500 that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this list, you'll see
that it's you probably could think of
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that you could put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, things like irrigation and
sawdust mulch and of course, the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: land prep, all of these things add up to
this figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard figures anywhere from,
well, it's only about $3,000 to set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of this comes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this should be taken into account if
you're going to set up two acres or five
[SPEAKER_00]: acres or 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 10 acres is $80,000 to set this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's imperative that you know
what you're getting into before you go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Site selection certainly has a lot to do
with taking a soil test and finding out
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're starting off with,
what do you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the soils here in New Jersey,
where we are, right outside my window,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are from native standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.4.5 to 4.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter can be as high as 9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water table is 18 inches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in New Jersey, when they try to
plant blueberries in Northern Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a pH of 7.2 in some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has to be all taken care of before
you ever get into planting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the pine barrens looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I'd show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I was with some growers
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had told me they were down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were amazed at the soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually an old picture from the
1940s showing getting the land site level
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to work it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know actually where your water flow is
going, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another actually very old shot
from the 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually, as I understand it,
was taken while we were setting up the
[SPEAKER_00]: research station in the 60s that I'm
sitting at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go forward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the typical planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not used to this kind of
thing, you notice the soil looks so white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just kick away the top surface,
you will actually see that it's black
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reveals to you that, yes,
it's sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well-drained.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also high in organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, it can be 6%, 7%,
8%, 9% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also tell from that ditch
there where the water table is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries, 95% of the roots of a
blueberry plant are in the top 18 to 24
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot be in standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the research shows that within
24 hours, actually 27 hours of standing
[SPEAKER_00]: water, the roots actually start to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's sort of a myth that people
think that blueberries like to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: swampy areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be in wet areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be well-drained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots can't be in standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does show you in a jersey what this
water table looks like in the pine barrens
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a situation, of course,
you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very wet situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, we had a hurricane that
came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is on one of the biggest farms in
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This water is actually in excess of three
feet deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, unfortunately,
this water was only here like this for
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a day, a day and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have my reservations as to if these
plants were actually going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this planting actually made it quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was set back and yield that next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it came back fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's imperative to understand the need
of water in blueberries, the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you can't have
blueberries in a wet site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a situation where it was a wet
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice that there's a whole area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can use my pointer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole area in here is all the plants
have died out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is phytophor root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we confirmed this in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the drainage was just not
adequate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very tough to come back from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an important thing that this
should have been really addressed early
[SPEAKER_00]: before this planting was even ever put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I often get is about soil
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't have sandy, sandy loam
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I grow blueberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: My actually first exposure to blueberries
was when I was getting my master's at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those soils were heavy clay,
silty clay soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my first five years of growing and
dealing with blueberries was in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: that was not New Jersey Pine Barrens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we spent a lot of time and a lot of
work working on exactly what does it take
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow blueberries in non-traditional
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely can be done and done
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I said, you need to dot the I's and
cross all the T's.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that has to be done is,
as I mentioned, the Pine Barrens is high
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter here is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blueberries really need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not in the Jersey Pine
Barrens, with that kind of organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a lot of work in Arkansas to
find out what was the best mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I usually tell people the best
mulch is whatever mulch you can get for
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you're trying to do is build up
your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually did a study years ago in
Arkansas testing these mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular study was in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking at a plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice, there's markings on
this stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after four years, this plant had grown
to two feet and had no mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weeds were kept down by just hoeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a plant that was planted at the same
time with mulch, you notice that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: four feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference whatsoever except
for the use of mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mulch does a lot of good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mulch increases, of course,
your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers the temperature of the root
zone, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does suppress weeds to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can run into troubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mulch is a positive and a negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the long run, mulch is a definite
positive from a blueberry standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to note that
blueberries in New Jersey were never
[SPEAKER_00]: mulched because we had the native organic
matter already high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after decades of growing blueberries
with the use of herbicides and with we
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote a poll in the middle of the rows,
we have slowly burnt up our organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil test coming back five and six
years ago, the organic matter was often
[SPEAKER_00]: around 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, we decided, well,
a lot of the guys are starting on mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see there's a question about
incorporating mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't like incorporating mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're trying to do is let it break
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with mulch, any uncomposed
mulch in the rooting zone at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it basically robs the plant of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microorganisms spend their time trying
to break the mulch down instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer going to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing I put in a hole,
planting hole, is something like peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is excellent, and that is what I
really would call the Cadillac of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials as far as putting in the
planting hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would never put anything that is
especially not composted in the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Jersey, we either use peat moss or
here we have also a cranberry industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can get cranberry leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compost them, usually at least two
years, then that can be put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a good idea to put anything
raw into the root zone at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who has ever seen one of my talks
anyplace knows that I often say the three
[SPEAKER_00]: most important factors for successful
blueberry growing are pH, pH, and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is critical, and I believe that from my
work that the optimum pH of high bush
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries is about 4.5 to 4.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a soil that you're
starting with that is not within that
[SPEAKER_00]: range, it needs to be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To lower pH, you add sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: To increase pH, you add lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount depends on what your pH is and
what your soil type is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those recommendations you can get from
your soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is that you have to
change the pH, and it is not an overnight
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if we were sitting here
right now and a grower calls me up and
[SPEAKER_00]: says, well, I want to plant in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pH is 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not planting in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you possibly may be able to plant in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my mind, you probably should wait
until the following season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research shows that it takes about two to
four months to change the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the organisms that do this need 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work best at around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put on sulfur right now,
nothing's going to happen to it until late
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, you put the plants on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may indeed lose them because
they're not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing pH is a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't rush into planting if the
pH is not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also tell people that if they are going
to grow blueberries, they really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go out and get a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how critical it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if your native pH is not 4.5 to
4.8, then you should be checking your pH
[SPEAKER_00]: every spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be cumbersome if you're
having to run to some lab or something all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you actually go out there and take
a test, and I don't mean a pH meter from
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to actually get a good pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we use peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably about a 50-50 mix of peat
moss and your planting hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have asked me, well, do you bring
in the topsoil?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's really not good to put other
topsoil in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually best to use your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you have actually a barrier
between your soil and the topsoil,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've brought it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 50-50 mix is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss usually runs, as I understand,
it usually runs at a pH of 3.8 to around
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.2, 4.3, depending on where you're
getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what would be a good pH meter?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one from Spectrum Electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called a pH Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs about $150.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's S-P-E-C-T-R-U-M, Spectrum
Electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often mention this in the Blueberry
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about $150.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it out the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size of a large pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make a nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we did some tests trying to find
one that is accurate and reasonably
[SPEAKER_00]: priced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one we came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH Pro from Spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another question is, if bands
band sulfur acid in two bands,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much per acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, you really shouldn't band
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure exactly what the intent
of this question was, except they were
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking maybe putting bands down where
the plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing blueberries,
the entire area needs to be decreased to
[SPEAKER_00]: that area of 4.5 to 4.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have this idea, well, you know,
under the plants, it could be 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out in the wild, it'll be 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's water that moves back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your middles are 6.5 and under the
plant is 4.5 at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, by August, under your plants are
going to be 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the entire area needs to be taken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means Vicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can, in fact, use pelletized
sulfur, if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the entire area that you're growing
blueberries needs to be brought into that
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal range of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually mention a lot about varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not, I don't want to
make a knock on New Jersey, but the number
[SPEAKER_00]: one criteria for varieties in New Jersey
is yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that would be number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only grow three varieties in New
Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow an early, we grow a mid,
and we grow a late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our early is Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mid is Blue Crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our late is Elliott.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yield is, and questionably,
the top criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, we really don't care what they
taste like, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Duke is certainly not a great flavored
blueberry, and Elliott is not either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to ask yourself,
what is your top priority?
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing about Elliott, it doesn't
get a whole lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke is very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are going to run a pick your
own operation, it seems to me that one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important things is flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people can go into the
supermarket and buy berries from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often they are not that great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are wonderful varieties that are
available, that are what I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: actually gourmet berries and gourmet
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are seldom grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I had to pick your own operation,
that's the way I would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of my favorites is Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elizabeth is easily better than anything
on the market, from a flavor standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to crop as high as Blue Crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly much better flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elizabeth is named after Elizabeth White.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elizabeth White basically started the
blueberry industry here in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's later than Blue Crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main reasons why we don't grow
it is because it is sort of a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that is a weeping kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in New Jersey, we do a lot of
mechanical harvesting, and a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: leans over is not really good for
mechanical harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one grows it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's available through one of the
nurseries in New Jersey here, Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very old variety that's early,
that's wonderful flavored is Ivanhoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be tougher to find,
but I've tasted it a few different places
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the new ones, Legacy, Darrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darrow is an older one, but Legacy is an
actual flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is later than Blue Crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all good flavored varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all I'm saying is that you really need
to kind of ask yourself what you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would go for varieties, if I was
going to pick your own, that everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to rave about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a young planting in New Jersey
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you notice the colors look very
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's very, really high organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see actually irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You rarely will find any.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one in New Jersey would put any
planting now without irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the new plantings are using trickle
irrigation, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing is this because you can
put fertilizer through the trickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a question about Draper and Bonus,
Liberty and Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't tested them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in our variety trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard good things about Liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aurora is very late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be too late for anyone north of New
Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Draper is not quite as late, as I
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I would do is if I want to
look into these is actually talk to or
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a twilight meeting here at the
research station in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is in late May, early June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the main focus of that will
be to walk through those varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the plants and taste the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Draper and Aurora have developed in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly could get information from
them, more up-to-date information on those
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties if you'd like to know more about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call solid-state
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the typical irrigation that we
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why it was popular and
is still popular in certain plantings is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's also good for frost control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are places in the Pine Barrens here
that are subject to frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we often, in those areas,
need this kind of irrigation for frost
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anybody put this kind of
irrigation in, in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think trickle is more efficient as
far as use of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole idea that you can put
fertilizer through it is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been found very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a shot of a blueberry farm up in
Burlington County, county north of where I
[SPEAKER_00]: am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice all the dead leaves on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries are not good at all at
competing for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a drought situation, they can get
into big trouble without irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, often the Burlington
County fields did not have irrigation or
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't use it as much as they should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they ran into a lot of
troubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back in, I believe, I took this in
1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this had lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what leaves look like when
they are, when you're in the drought
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the dieback of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly this will hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future yields of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really hurt cane production and
flower production, initiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I would never put in a
blueberry planting without irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it's just foolhardy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting shot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to put this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often show this shot because it shows
you that this was in Burlington County
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was also in 1988 during a
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmer did not have irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had used herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the herbicides went down this row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he ran out of herbicides about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice the weeds along here on
both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice right where the weeds
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again showing blueberries cannot
out-compete anything for water and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, that is also why you have
to have a very good herbicide program or
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of weed control program in
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're just not able to
out-compete other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of the only crops that I know
of that do not have root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are shallow rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, if you don't have
irrigation and you have weeds there,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of what is out there, water and
nutrients, it's going to be picked up by
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds, not the blueberry plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question here about landscape
fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a grower that has tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a good match.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they ran into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth was not there with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I think I need to
look into a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was very hot on the idea for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came from a vegetable background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically ran into so many problems
with growth of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he tore up the landscape product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other areas of the world that
are using that, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just down in Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Chile, they do use it pretty
extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the jury is out on that
one yet from a high bush blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more work needs to be really done
on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use it at all in Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to move to a little bit more into
fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have done an awful lot with
fertilization over the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've increased yields dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice on this list here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is that, as I mentioned,
we monitor pH all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do an annual leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We monitor and correct any nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really are trying to get it to grow
the plant as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apply fertilizer at the most efficient
time for uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we prune correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things have greatly increased
yields here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice in 1994, we went from 4,000
pounds to 22,000 pounds in many fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a dramatic increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have said that they've gotten
two and three time increases in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how have we done this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, years ago in 94, we took samples of
the best fields and 39 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that we had
deficiencies of all kinds in all these
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized, well, we've got a problem
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really do have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also found was that if you
take a soil test, which is this above
[SPEAKER_00]: test, and you take a leaf analysis,
that there is actually no correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: between these two tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two tests were taken from the
same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice, for instance, in phosphorus
on the leaf analysis, this phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: level here is extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet the phosphorus down here is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil analysis up here of potassium
is low in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the potassium down here is actually in
the excessive level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we realize now is that there is no
correlation between the soil analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf analysis in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we have changed how we
make recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not use soil analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We totally base our fertilizer
recommendations with a leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we really look at a soil
analysis for is a pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see the organic matter
content, if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only thing I really want to
get from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, all of it is based on leaf
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have these, the chart in front of
you is nutrient concentration in blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know the levels of sufficient levels
of these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide, pH effect on nitrogen uptake,
and this is what we do get from the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the exact same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the exact same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this field on top, the pH is at 3.5,
and the field down here is at 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we did was change the pH,
put the exact same bit of nitrogen on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice this top line here is
nitrogen is deficient in this 3.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in 4.5, it is in a normal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, the nutrients are there,
but the pH, because of pH, the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is just not able to pick up the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, you could put more
nitrogen on it to make up for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the problem is, is that that costs you
more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pH does affect the availability of all
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the range here of 3.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice that a lower pH,
these nutrients are more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibum isn't, but these are all more
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing to know is,
is though that pH affects nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is iron chlorosis in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have blueberries, you've probably
seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a good thing because iron
chlorosis is 99% of the time due to high
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, not a lack of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost an indicator plant that you
are not monitoring your field right,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have no pH meter or you're just
not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's very important to notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blueberry plant in the wrong pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was planted, you notice they
didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why this plant grew at
all was because the field is mulched and
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you could see that because the
pH was off, these roots did nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, showing you how important pH
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH, sorry, the fertilization used to
be done when blueberries were dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done research now and we know that
that is not the right time to do
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization of blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old method was dormant and petal fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now realize that the new method should
be bud break and six weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry plant almost works like when
you're drinking a soda and you put a straw
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you suck on a straw, the soda comes
up from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the buds break on a blueberry plant,
it pulls the nutrients in up from the
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're putting fertilizer out there
when the blueberry is dormant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to wait to bud break to
put fertilizer out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of these are the treatments that
we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was dormant and the new was
when we had bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also did a trickle treatment where
the trickle was used when the plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: bud break also just to see how that would
affect blueberry yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suffice it to say that this is the
data from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between the old and the
new was a 21% increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a 10% increase even more than
that with the use of trickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't spend any more money putting
in the fertilizer later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just said, OK, we're going to put it in
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, we greatly increased the
use of the yields that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, this was dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, many growers have told me
that they have doubled yield with this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fertilizer regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving to trickle, that they have
actually doubled yields and even more than
[SPEAKER_00]: doubled in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a couple of questions here,
but I'm going to see if I can get through
[SPEAKER_00]: this and I'll get back to you if that's
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're about near the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, our fertilizer
recommendations are based on leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get a leaf of analysis if
you're going to make some decisions as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is monitored annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum is 4.5, which is 4.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertile application is later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more efficient, and you get higher
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in effect, you get firmer fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's data that I didn't show you,
but you do get firmer fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can fertilize through your
trickle irrigation, you actually can get
[SPEAKER_00]: even higher yields, which is what you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonia mentioned our blueberry bulletin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not send this out as an email,
but this is the address of the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: bulletin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out weekly from March through
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go on, you can just download it and
pull it up, and it's free of charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is I put my email on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions after this
is over, I certainly will answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to do those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura, do I have time for questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you fix nutrient deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you do a leaf analysis,
then you know what you are deficient in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NPK is classically a granular
fertilizer that you put down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually can also put it through the
trickle, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micronutrient deficiencies are usually
done from a foliar standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they certainly can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty easy to actually fix a
nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that you've got to know they're
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that micronutrients are
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only time you add micronutrients
is when you know that you are deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get into trouble, just as much
trouble with too much as too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatments of others growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly you still try to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different sources of
fertilizer from an organic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But timing is still something that is
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some growers in New Jersey
that are organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that you still want to time
it so that the fertilizer release is timed
[SPEAKER_00]: for when you have bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that you don't want to
do is to have such a slow release of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, which is the bigger problem
from an organic standpoint, that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: still releasing fertilizer late in the
summer and the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to time that fertilizer
for that, especially for that six-week
[SPEAKER_00]: period from bud break in New Jersey would
be till late June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on the fertilizer
that you're using from an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep that in mind when you're applying
it or getting a source of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer from a organic standpoint,
that you're trying to still time it for
[SPEAKER_00]: that critical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we put mulch down, now I'm talking
specifically on top of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it really doesn't have to be aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do better for your planting if
it's aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you actually have
composted your mulch, it will be easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with fertilization of your plants
because one of the things about raw mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: on top is that people ask me, well,
do you have to increase your fertilization
[SPEAKER_00]: rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next question invariably is,
well, how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the composting stage and the
kind of compost that you have or mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have, it's impossible to tell you
how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be up to twice as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that mulch is actually composted
already and broken down, then the increase
[SPEAKER_00]: is minimal and you will get the best
benefit from an organic standpoint for
[SPEAKER_00]: your planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as wood chips or hardwoods,
no, I don't believe there's a difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big benefit of one over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the best benefit is just
finding one you can get for the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're near a sawmill and they use
specifically pine and they'll give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: chips, that's the one you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen any work showing one with
one or the other, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that hardwoods will usually
break down slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to compost them,
they'll break down slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pine will usually break down faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are kind of the things that you
have to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the one that we use in New Jersey as
far as going through the trickle
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation is one called Plant Food Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Food Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is somebody that we use pretty
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually part of our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have actually fertilizers
specifically for blueberries and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for trickle irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've done a great job with that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio of NPK really depends on your
soil test and your leaf analysis that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard thing used to be a 10,
10, 10, 600 pounds per acre, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: give you 60 pounds actual nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's only a place to start until you
get up and running from a leaf analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: From then on, the tweaking of how much the
ratio would be between the NPK is totally
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on your leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question about sawdust versus
wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if that's what you can get,
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will break down faster, which can be a
good thing for the plants, but you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: to replace it more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walnut, yeah, I've heard walnuts can be
dangerous because they could supply
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow I doubt you'd ever be able to get
walnut because of the high price of that
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would steer away from them,
I think, from a walnut standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of information is also available in
the High Bush Blueberry Production Guide
[SPEAKER_04]: by N-Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that nutritional information is
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get onto Dr. Pavlis' Blueberry
Bulletin, you can get some of this
[SPEAKER_04]: information and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those links and everything will be on this
webinar when it's archived.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might make a comment about the Pro-Jib
use by Sonja, who was asking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey does use Pro-Jib in bad years,
but I think the most important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is effective, but I would just
mention that you have to be sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination is not doing well before using
Pro-Jib because once you put the Pro-Jib
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you cannot pollinate naturally
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pro-Jib does result in smaller berries and
later berries, so I wouldn't use it unless
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that your pollination is not
doing as well as it could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody else have any other
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question about when do I
recommend leafing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Jersey, we basically say when blue
crop has finished, which is basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of July.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a rain and can't fertilize
overhead, what method can you fertilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertigate is through your trickle,
so you can do that in rain or no rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What method can you fertilize overhead?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what that question means,
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't fertilize through our solid-state
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either a pelleted application or...
[SPEAKER_00]: For the rest of you, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to remind everybody, we don't have
two weeks between these webinars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week will be the last blueberry
webinar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Wednesday, December 9th at 1pm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to learn a little bit about
some innovations in Japanese beetle
[SPEAKER_04]: control and also a new pest in New
England, winter moth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that you will join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, someone asked about ammonium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be applied over the mulch or
should it be incorporated?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No in that you never use ammonium nitrate
in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nitrate is not a form of nitrogen
that blueberries can uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use ammonium forms of nitrogen and you
use ammonium sulfate if your pH is high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you never use ammonium nitrate in
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the nitrate pot is actually toxic
to blueberries and you're paying for that
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen source and you don't...
[SPEAKER_00]: use it, you can't need it, you don't need
it, and it's not being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never use ammonium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other question is how do you
distribute the pelleted fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer is put underneath the
plants, not in the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the blueberry guys here have is a
vicon that is directed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, rather than going all over
the back, there's a guard on there that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it just go underneath the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think I'm done with the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everybody for all the great
questions and maybe we'll do this again
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I guess I can get out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who remain, I think Tom
Stevenson, you wanted to take a look at
[SPEAKER_04]: this chart again and there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it up so that you can take a
peek at it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of you, you might want to
copy down some of that information.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Lin,
[SPEAKER_04]: Linna, let me do this.
Okay.
