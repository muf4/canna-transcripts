[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Neil, for your introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I get started, I would like to say
a few words for this seminar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, I will be giving it as an
extension seminar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my extension program targets two groups
of audience, the Apple industry and the
[SPEAKER_05]: general public, especially the master
gander volunteers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today, I will be treating you guys as
part of these two groups for next hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that said, here's my outline of my
talk today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be basically addressing two
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is, what is genomics?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be beginning with a few key concepts
in genomics and then talk about major
[SPEAKER_05]: accomplishments in genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question is, why genomics is a
vital solution for challenges in fruit and
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetable production?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the focus of my talk today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be mentioning briefly the challenges
we're facing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then describe the solutions or genomic
solution for these challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be using cabbage, black rot,
resistance, and apple for the quality as
[SPEAKER_05]: example.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before I get started, OK, the first
question is about what is genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to answer the question, let's look at
this picture first.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, this one is really a touching story.
[SPEAKER_05]: The slide itself is adopted from the fly
of a French documentary made a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gorilla named Digit lived with the
family, Pierre and Annie for four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gorilla really became a member of the
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the end, the gorilla has to leave
back to where she really belongs because
[SPEAKER_05]: the fully grown gorilla is really
different from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now from the point of genetics,
the difference is caused by the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, we can say that it is
the genome that makes this family must be
[SPEAKER_05]: broken off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But please do not think the genome is a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it is also the genome that makes
us who we are, why we have such a diverse
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the same reason, the apple fruits can
be always distinguishable from other
fruits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Such as pear and peach.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may think it's easy to understand
the difference between the species are
[SPEAKER_05]: caused by the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what about the difference within a same
genome?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or that would be also caused by the genome
as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, these are the four types
of fruits.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they belong to the same species called
Brasca rapa.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at how they differ from each
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at their genome sequence,
probably more than 99% they are the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the 1% difference is enough for what
you see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is said that the genome not only
determines the difference, between the
[SPEAKER_05]: species, but also determine the difference
within the same species.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little variation in the genome that can
make a huge difference in their
[SPEAKER_05]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, talk about the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is genome exactly?
[SPEAKER_05]: In the scientific term, genome is a total
collection of DNA or genes in a
[SPEAKER_05]: reproductive cell, such as sperm,
egg, pollen, that contains all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: genetic information needed to build an
organism.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a genome is really like a blueprint for
building a magnificent building,
[SPEAKER_05]: such an empire building, we're all
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the DNA of the genome, contains a lot
of millions and millions of bases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you print the genome, there will be
a hugely thick book.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the apple genome, there are about
750 million bases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the apple genome book would have 750
million letters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Assuming we can print 3,000 letters per
page, that would count for a quarter
[SPEAKER_05]: million pages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now in the genome of an apple cabbage,
the genome book will be a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: thinner, with 284 million letters.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it still takes about 95,000 pages to
print.
[SPEAKER_05]: To print it all out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the living cells, the genome DNA is
naturally divided into a limited number of
[SPEAKER_05]: units, and organized into a structure
called chromosomes, as shown in this
[SPEAKER_05]: picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the apple genome have 17 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're using the concept of book,
so the apple genome book would have 17
[SPEAKER_05]: chapters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now similarly, for the brassica and laba,
which is the laba cabbage, they have 10
[SPEAKER_05]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the brassica and laba cabbage genome
book would have 10 chapters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now gene is another important concept in
genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have heard about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So genes are the basic functional unit of
genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genes carry important genetic information.
[SPEAKER_05]: So genes are located at various locations
along this chromosome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a single genome can be a home for genes
of silence.
[SPEAKER_05]: The text box here actually shows a DNA
sequence for a gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, this is a gene responsible for
controlling apple flow acidity,
[SPEAKER_05]: we identified recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first three letters, ATG,
serves as a start button for the gene to
[SPEAKER_05]: get translated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last three letters serve for the
start button.
[SPEAKER_05]: For translation termination, the mother
letters somehow changed the basis in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle of the red G, the G1455 we called
it, to A1455 in some of the apple
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes those apples tasteless,
because the acidity is too low.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we seek introduction to the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's talk about what is genomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genome, in the short word, is a study of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mainly investigating the structure
and function of the genome, the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on the area of focus,
there are structural genomics,
[SPEAKER_05]: functional genomics, comparative genomics,
and synthetic genomics, and many others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So genomics is a new and dominating
discipline in genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's part of genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much has been accomplished in fruit and
vegetable genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: This slide shows about 17 fruits and
vegetables, which genome has been
[SPEAKER_05]: sequenced, including apple, and grape,
and oranges, and tomato.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to mention that sequencing of the
tomato genome is primarily led by Jim
[SPEAKER_05]: Gionani here at BTI.
[SPEAKER_05]: The development of talents-based
biotechnology is another major
[SPEAKER_05]: accomplishment in genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So talents stands for, the word a little
bit awkward here, stands for transcription
[SPEAKER_05]: activator-like effect nucleonates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talents-based biotechnology is a major
breakthrough in biotechnology that comes
[SPEAKER_05]: out from the genomic studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: The major property of talent is to make a
cut in the genome at a specific location.
[SPEAKER_05]: So talent is extremely useful and a
worthwhile tool for genome editing because
[SPEAKER_05]: of that property.
[SPEAKER_05]: The major advantage of talent-based
biotechnology is that talents-improved
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetable and fruits are very comparable
with those that are developed by
[SPEAKER_05]: conventional breeding because there is no
foreign DNA involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come back to all this a little later
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bottom drawing shows a talent that
cut a target site in the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much for the introduction of genome and
genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now let's address the second question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is genomics a vital solution for
challenges in fruit and vegetable
[SPEAKER_05]: production?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always challenging.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to the rising labor cost and
the material cost, profitability and pest
[SPEAKER_05]: control are the major challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: To address the profitability challenges,
optimizing cropping system and the
[SPEAKER_05]: practice for high yield and quality are
the commonly used.
[SPEAKER_05]: To control the damaging diseases and pests
and insects, the chemical sprays are used
[SPEAKER_05]: most frequently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other means that are more
cost effective?
[SPEAKER_05]: What about developing superior varieties
of fruits or vegetables?
[SPEAKER_05]: That are naturally of high yield and
quality and resistance to multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: diseases and insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: From any standard, this is likely the best
approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why genomics can provide a vital
tool, vital solution for the challenges we
[SPEAKER_05]: are facing in fruit and vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two ways genomes can provide
solutions for developing such superior
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first will be using biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So given the controversy of existing
biotechnology, the talent-based
[SPEAKER_05]: biotechnology really holds the promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see a lot along the way we will go
breeding by design.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second would be help of conventional
breeding by marker-assisted breeding or
[SPEAKER_05]: genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we not showing these examples?
[SPEAKER_05]: The first example is improvement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Improvement of black rot resistance in
brassica oneraceae.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black rot is probably the most damaging
disease in crucifix worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the causal agent is bacterium
lassamolus campestris campestris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black rot is especially damaging to
brassica oneraceae vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Such as cabbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the photo on the lower left side shows
the black rot damage to cabbages in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the photo on the lower right side
shows the black rot damage inside a
[SPEAKER_05]: cabbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got this photo from Griff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for his help.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to cabbage, there are several
common vegetables that are also brassica
[SPEAKER_05]: oneraceae, including broccoli and
cauliflower and Brussels sprouts and
[SPEAKER_05]: several others shown here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of these brassica oneraceae
vegetables have problem of black rot
[SPEAKER_05]: disease problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what makes black rot a particular
problem for brassica oneraceae?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are at least three factors that are
contributing to this situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is the source of black rot
resistance in brassica oneraceae is very
[SPEAKER_05]: rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are only about two sessions report
of resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: As shown here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second, the resistance is very,
very specific and risk dependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: The third factor is the resistance can
only be partially bred into new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of these limitations,
breeding for high black rot resistance has
[SPEAKER_05]: met with little success.
[SPEAKER_05]: To help with this long struggle for high
black rot resistance, two talents-based
[SPEAKER_05]: approach are envisioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is to identify the resistance
genes from brassica relatives and then
[SPEAKER_05]: transfer them into brassica oneraceae.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the second is to directly identify and
directly modify the susceptibility genes
[SPEAKER_05]: within brassica oneraceae to convert that
into resistant genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the first approach, we need to know
what the resistance are there in the
[SPEAKER_05]: brassica relatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the resistance in brassica relatives
cannot be bred into brassica oneraceae Now
[SPEAKER_05]: here shows strong resistance in several
brassica species, including brassica rapa,
[SPEAKER_05]: brassica nigra, brassica jonsi,
and brassica carinata.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the resistance in these relatives
cannot be easily bred into brassica
[SPEAKER_05]: oneraceae.
[SPEAKER_05]: To explain that, let's look at the
relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: Between the brassica species, there are
six major brassica species, including
[SPEAKER_05]: three diploid and three tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The three diploid are brassica rapa of A
genome of 10 chromosomes and brassica
[SPEAKER_05]: nigra of B genome of 8 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And brassica oneraceae of C genome of 9
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the three tetraploid species are
thought to be derived from the natural
[SPEAKER_05]: hybridization between the diploid species
followed by chromosome dipheny.
[SPEAKER_05]: The genome of laba cabbage, which we call
brassica, laba has been completely
[SPEAKER_05]: sequenced, and the brassica oneraceae
certainly is the topic of this example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if you make a cross between brassica
oneraceae with any of these species with
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance, the hybrid will be not viable
because the imbalance of chromosome
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this explains why the resistance in
other brassica species cannot be moved
[SPEAKER_05]: into brassica oneraceae by conventional
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, tennis-based biotechnology is
an ideal choice for moving the brassica
[SPEAKER_05]: native resistant gene into brassica
oneraceae.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second approach is more exciting
because we don't need to involve any other
[SPEAKER_05]: brassica species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We simply need to identify the
susceptibility genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This approach has been recently
demonstrated successfully in rice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you in next slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the first row shows a part of a gene
in a rice cultivar that is susceptible to
[SPEAKER_05]: bacterial blight disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is most described to do this in
rice, one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the rest of the rows basically is the
mutations that are induced by talents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those, the dash, stand for the DNA that
were missing, that were deleted by the
[SPEAKER_05]: talents, and the red, the red in the red
are the DNA bases added by the talents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now here's a comparison of the difference
in the niche in length between the
[SPEAKER_05]: non-modified control and the talents
modified rice line.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's clear that the susceptibility gene
has been converted into resistant genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, the talents modified rice line
contains no foreign DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these rice lines are really comparable
with conventionally bred any rice
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with talents-based approach,
high black rod resistance in brassica
[SPEAKER_05]: oneraceae will be available soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is so much for the first example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm going to talk about the second
example, which is the improvement of fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: quality based on the fruit acidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will show you how market assisted
breeding has been done or can be done to
[SPEAKER_05]: improve fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two major reasons to begin with
apple fruit acidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first reason is that fruit acidity
largely determines fruit taste and flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fruit acidity is one of the major
components that affect fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So other component includes crispiness,
firmness, juiciness, size, soluble
[SPEAKER_05]: content, storability, and texture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second reason probably the major
reason, the apple breeder rated fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: acidity the number one priority trait for
breeding and for genetic studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come back to this point, why apple
breeder rated fruit acidity the number one
[SPEAKER_05]: priority trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple varies widely in the fruit acidity
levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on our own measurement, fruit pH
varies from 2.8 to 4.5 and to treatable
[SPEAKER_05]: acidity, the TA varies from 0.07% to
0.87%.
[SPEAKER_05]: The acceptable range for a dessert apple
variety is pH 3.1 to 3.8 or TA 0.3 to 1%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple fruits with fruit acidity level
beyond this range are either too high or
[SPEAKER_05]: too low in acidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: In apple genetics, it's known that acidity
levels is primarily controlled by the gene
[SPEAKER_05]: we call MA, as I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two lils or versions of this
gene, one for high acid, one for low acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The high acid allele is dominant over the
low acid allele.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are three possible genotypes in
apple, homozygous high acid genotype and
[SPEAKER_05]: heterozygous high acid genotype and
homozygous low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because apple received one allele from the
seed parent, another allele from the
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a survey, 79% of the named apple
varieties are heterozygous high acid
[SPEAKER_05]: genotype, and 14% homozygous high acid
genotype, and 7% homozygous low acid
[SPEAKER_05]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these two high acid genotypes are
supposed to produce fruits of high acid,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the low acid genotype produce low acid
fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: When apple has a low acid genotype,
the fruit tastes very flat, no flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in breeding programs, those seasonings
will be useless.
[SPEAKER_05]: No commercial value, need to be thrown
away as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the heterozygous high acid genotype
is dominant in the named apple varieties,
[SPEAKER_05]: so most breeding population is derived
from two genotypes that are both
[SPEAKER_05]: heterozygous high acid, as shown here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the progenies of this kind of crosses
surrogates like one quarter of seasonings
[SPEAKER_05]: of a low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So although the breeder knows that,
growing in this genotype is useless,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's wasting time and money, but they
cannot throw them away with confidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the rate for the seeded number
is one priority trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone can help them doing this one,
that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we wanted to identify the
fruit of seeded gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So through extensive effort, we were able
to reveal the identity of gene MA.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned earlier, the MA gene has
1,707 DNA bases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And encoding a magic acid transport
protein of 568 amino acids.
[SPEAKER_05]: The arrow stands for the reading direction
of the gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: The upper two rows shows the DNA bases and
their corresponding positions with the
[SPEAKER_05]: omission of the majority.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lower two rows shows the corresponding
amino acid residuals and the corresponding
[SPEAKER_05]: position.
[SPEAKER_05]: We find that a single base mutation from
G1455 to A1455 in the gene MA is
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for low acid fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned earlier, the reason is that
the mutation caused a premature stop
[SPEAKER_05]: button in the MA gene, as shown here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the mutation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they cause this stop button here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they cut off the rest of the amino
acids, which is 84 of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So presumably, these cause the MA gene MA
function.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the finding of this gene,
we want to use it in our breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we developed a marker called
CAHPS1455 to specifically target in the
[SPEAKER_05]: mutation site and the location.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this gel shows an example of analysis
of the marker CAHPS1455 in a diverse set
[SPEAKER_05]: of apple varieties and selected
selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of the lanes stand for apple variety
or a selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tall bands stand for high acid allele.
[SPEAKER_05]: The low bands stand for low acid allele.
[SPEAKER_05]: The single tall bands in these lanes are
for homozygous high acid in red.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the single low bands in the lanes
stand for homozygous low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those with two bands stand for
heterozygous high acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those in red and in yellow are expected
to produce fruit of high acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those in white are expected to produce
fruit of low acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the pH data.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those varieties and selections,
this is exactly what we expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, in the three white lanes,
which is a homozygous low acid genotype,
[SPEAKER_05]: the pH measured from 4.3 to 4.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very high pH, just in low acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is indicating that marker
CAHPS1455 is a versatile marker for
[SPEAKER_05]: marker-assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: How to apply this marker in apple
breeding?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first will be marker-assisted
selection of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in collaboration with apple breeder,
Dr. Susan Brown, we tested this marker in
[SPEAKER_05]: one of her large apple breeding
population.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, each lane stands for a seedling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this picture shows part of the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lane with a single band that's
indicated with a red arrow are for
[SPEAKER_05]: homozygous high acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those with two bands indicated with a
yellow arrow are heterozygous high acid
[SPEAKER_05]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those with a single low band are
homozygous low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just based on we have 96 seedlings
shown here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have about 23% of low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very close to 25% as we expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those seedlings seriously can be thrown
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have suggested those, though,
but she hasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the second application is
marker-assisted planning for nucleosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the idea is to maximize the
heterozygous high acid genotype in the
[SPEAKER_05]: progeny, while minimize the portion of low
acid genotype of homozygous low acid
[SPEAKER_05]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the base cross will be made between a
homozygous low acid genotype and a
[SPEAKER_05]: homozygous high acid genotype,
like shown here with dark green,
[SPEAKER_05]: because progeny of these crosses are 100%
heterozygous high acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cross is between two heterozygous
high acid genotype or between a
[SPEAKER_05]: heterozygous high acid genotype with a
homozygous high acid genotype also
[SPEAKER_05]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cross is made between a homozygous
low acid genotype with a heterozygous high
[SPEAKER_05]: acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: That can be done, but half of that,
50% of the seedlings will be segregated
[SPEAKER_05]: for low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So crosses to avoid are those between two
homozygous low acid genotype and two
[SPEAKER_05]: homozygous high acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, in summary, so genome is the total
collection of a DNA, or genes in
[SPEAKER_05]: reproductive cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genomics is a study of the structural
function of the whole genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talents represent one of the major
breakthroughs in genome editing and in
[SPEAKER_05]: precise and clean genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And genomics provides vital solutions for
challenges that cannot be effectively
[SPEAKER_05]: addressed through conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genomics helps increase breeding
efficiency, especially in tree fruits of a
[SPEAKER_05]: long juvenile phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would thank Dr. Susan Brown,
Lenin Chen, and General Father for their
[SPEAKER_05]: help in the Florida City Project.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also would like to thank Debbie and
Laurie for help in my extension program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yangbei is my grad student, and Laura is a
technician in the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to stop here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your attention and ready for
any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very nice question.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a question I ask myself all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I didn't show here.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we try to identify the gene MA,
we genotype many apple seedlings in a
[SPEAKER_05]: population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at their distribution,
clearly there's two peaks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the breaking point around 3.8 in
pH, and the TA is around 0.3.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we put one category as a low
acid, another category with a high acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a continuous variation within each
of the categories.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is the next phase of our
goal, to find out what exactly causing
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the MA gene, the major function of the
MA gene is to make that cut for the high
[SPEAKER_05]: acid group and for the low acid group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, to find toning it, certainly there's
other factors involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the things we are pursuing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very vigorously.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I have that, I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, well, I don't mean to discount the
rules of a coping system and the field
[SPEAKER_05]: management.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is not my point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize these are very important efforts
need to be done, need to be in place to
[SPEAKER_05]: manage the field management.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the point that I try to make is if we
have a resistant variety, that will be
[SPEAKER_05]: really helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly not all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this will be helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what really the process will
be in the regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say that based on the fact,
OK, there's no foreign DNA being used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being involved in those talents,
modified lines, this should not be
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my view.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people certainly can argue the process
that you used is similar to those that we
[SPEAKER_05]: used for conventional biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact is, we don't have anything
left.
[SPEAKER_05]: We must respect the fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should be easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I don't know, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I should say it first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I guess it should be easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then your second question, can you remind
me that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part acceptance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's probably very similar to
the first situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to get the facts out.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really different from the first generation
technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: The technology is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's nothing that really knows
nothing being involved in the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why you want to reject this,
if that's going to be resistant,
[SPEAKER_05]: or it's going to be higher or higher
quality?
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, so we can ever know what the
public really react to that technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, that's something unexpected.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't expect that kind of message will
be conveyed through that slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make a point that it is the
genome that makes who we are, what a
[SPEAKER_05]: gorilla is, why a gorilla is a gorilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see your point.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I will pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to avoid that next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the comment, Gary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a slide prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: For this seminar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll take it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something called central dogma.
[SPEAKER_05]: DNA makes RNA, makes protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, I'd like to take that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I may consider to put it back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the question is this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you start in cross, try to develop
a new upper varieties, you basically don't
[SPEAKER_05]: want those low seasonings in your breeding
population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to get rid of those as early
as possible to save some space in the
[SPEAKER_05]: orchard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So suddenly, they'll be reducing some of
the growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost, hopefully increase the breeding
efficiency because you can plan more
[SPEAKER_05]: useful screening in a limited area with
limited resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not think the 80% upper varieties now
have a high acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are already developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I talk about is for getting the
better varieties sooner and quicker and
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Larry.
[SPEAKER_05]: My experience with moth agunas are very
positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like they are very receptive
to this kind of new information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly, my experience was limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just based on what the feedback that I
got.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the experience with apple industry is
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just tell you one of the
feedback that I get for the two lectures
[SPEAKER_05]: that I give in winter for schools for
apple growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they scored like one is the worst.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four is the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, four is excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two is fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one is poor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the topic itself, I got a score of
2.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about a 400 audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: The feedback is probably more than 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where you know where that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the master gardener thought seemed to
be against the idea of
moth agunas?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not sense that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I gave them a talk,
I didn't say the transgenics will be used
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, we need to go through the
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just tried to explain the fact that new
technology are there since they were
[SPEAKER_05]: getting cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully, it will be more acceptable
to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at their acid, about 3.7,
still within high acid range in pH.
[SPEAKER_05]: The TA is like a four.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's still within the bigger category
of high acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have the genotype data using the
market we developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuji is clearly the heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an apple grower, I think we're living
in one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those thousand pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Golden Delicious,
probably the most popular apple variety in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you look at the pH and TA at the
highest, it's way above the border that I
[SPEAKER_05]: said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the pH is 3.8, and the TA is 3.0,
or 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way above the range.
[SPEAKER_05]: So way into the high acid range.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm talking about high acid is not
really you can even taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a relative term to those double,
basically, homologated law at the
[SPEAKER_05]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
