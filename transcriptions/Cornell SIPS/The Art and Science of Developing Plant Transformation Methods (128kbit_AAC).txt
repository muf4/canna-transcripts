[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lower the lights because
some of the slides, I think, will show it
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Klaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank Klaus for inviting
me to talk with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my very first plant biology
seminar, and I'm happy to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to tell you about some of our
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the title, I include the word art
and science because I found over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: that working in plant tissue culture and
transformation, there's definitely an art
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a field with experience for what
should be done next, and there's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of creativity involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as I think about it,
I think the same is true for other areas
[SPEAKER_00]: of research as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some points that I'm going to
cover during my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some background on tissue
culture and plant transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought giving you some of the basics
would be, you know, really good before I
[SPEAKER_00]: launched into how we develop the methods
and giving you examples of the projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa Earle, as Klaus mentioned,
I did my graduate work in her lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and before her retirement, she taught an
entire class on tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have just a few slides to,
you know, kind of put you on that level so
[SPEAKER_00]: you understand why we do what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use these current projects as
examples of how we develop those methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape is the most recent one in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with Anurag Agrawal at
Cornell on Asclepias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as Klaus mentioned, we're
working with Ceteria viridis, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 photosynthesis grass that we're
developing as a model species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll end by telling you some of
the next steps for those projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I see it, there are four
components to development of these
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the plant tissue culture and plant
regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even before we go into transformation,
we have to have an efficient method for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for potato, we start with plants that
are grown in tissue culture in test tubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is referred to as in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put those stem pieces on a medium
that induces this growth called callus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an unorganized mass of cells,
somewhat analogous to a tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tweak that medium to give the
cells the signal to produce plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little potato plants are then
removed from the callus and transferred to
[SPEAKER_00]: a rooting medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato, we start with cotyledon pieces
from seedlings that are grown in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all examples of plant
regeneration after transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see that not every piece of
plant material is regenerating shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for sataria, we start with callus
that is induced from mature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you about that in
more detail later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we use for the
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that callus is put onto a
regeneration medium to induce these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have a good system worked out for
the plant tissue culture, then we move
[SPEAKER_00]: into the gene transfer methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: A critical part of this and can sometimes
be a stumbling block is in the rooting and
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation to greenhouse conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, of course, work all this out before we
even try gene transfer methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, lots of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to go from start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see when I talk about grape,
we're sometimes working with very small
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material that we have to use a
dissecting scope in order to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start working out a new method,
we'll first go to the literature to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything has been reported for that
particular plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't find anything, then we look to
see what is the most closely related
[SPEAKER_00]: relative, see if there's anything reported
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't find anything, which happens
sometimes, we then go based on experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a lot of trial and error to find
out the best combination to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for plant material, we have a number of
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for monocots, what works best are
immature inflorescences, mature seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and immature embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: For dicots, you can pretty much try any
one of these types of plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: One part where we do spend quite a bit of
time also is working out methods to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that culture medium I showed you in
the slides contains sugar because they
[SPEAKER_00]: need a carbon source since they're growing
in laboratory conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't clean up that material,
the material will be overgrown by bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungi and it will kill the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use bleach, ethanol, sometimes
antifungal, antibacterial compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really a fine line sometimes
between finding the right method that will
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up the contaminants, yet not kill
the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these systems are easier than
others, but for something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the asclepias, we spent a lot of time
trying to find the best method for
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: For culture medium components,
not every medium contains all these
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an example of what you can
include in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major part of the medium is salt
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those salts are like nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, whatever is needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to support plant growth and culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of standard salt
formulations that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: One common one is called Michigan Skoog or
MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are even modified versions of
MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find, you can purchase an MS
medium that doesn't contain any ammonium
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate because some plant species are
sensitive to the ammonium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of parts to those salts
that can also affect the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most critical parts of the
medium are these plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are oxens and cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are an example of some oxens,
and these are some cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're working with these methods,
it's not only the choice of an oxen or
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokinin that can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we'll start out in an oxen,
but then move to a cytokinin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on the plant species
that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a carbohydrate source, sucrose is the
most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do work with some systems where
maltose or glucose works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelling agents, there are different types
of augers and gel and gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's really hard to convince
people that gelling agent can really make
[SPEAKER_00]: a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people think it's just not an
important part of the medium until we give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a protocol and we say you have to use
a gel and gum to start out with,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's emboldened and it's red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll contact me and they'll
say the method's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, all right, let's start
troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I find out that they substituted
a gelling agent that we didn't recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, really, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gelling agent can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also amino acids and vitamins
that are sometimes required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activated charcoal acts like an
antioxidant when some of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material will turn brown when we cut it
and put it in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the activated charcoal helps absorb
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also absorbs inhibitors that might
prevent plant regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked at Geranium when I was at
Sanford's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we would cut the pieces of
Geranium and put them in culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would just turn black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up looking at a number of
different types of antioxidants and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in order to prevent the
phenolics from taking down the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't see this as often now in
recent literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the earlier days, coconut water was
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still purchase coconut water
through some of the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it contains a number of sugars,
growth regulators, amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some undefined components that really
can make a difference in getting plant
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration or not getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in developing a transformation
method, where we spend the majority of our
[SPEAKER_00]: time is in the plant regeneration phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't start plant transformation until
we feel that the regeneration part is very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would recommend is that at
least 30% to 40% of your plant material is
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerating shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because when you do an
agrobacterium infection, not every cell is
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a system that's
regenerating a lot of shoots, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater chance of recovering transformants
in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I would say if you have
something that's less than 30%,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even try it until you get that
percentage up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three different methods that you
can use for transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agrobacterium, biolystics is the gene gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Klaus mentioned, the gene gun was
invented here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what happens is there are
micron-sized particles, gold or tungsten,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coated with DNA and blasted into
the plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a DNA uptake into
protoplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a leaf, you treat it with
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes away the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're left with the protoplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are methods to increase
that DNA uptake into the protoplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our lab, we use agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of our work, we find that it works
perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soil-borne bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30 years ago, a group of scientists
decided that since agrobacterium is
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering plants in nature, it transfers
genes into plant cells to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites that it needs to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they take that bacterium from the soil
and use it in the lab to transfer genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the whole start of plant
biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, the number of reports was
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increased dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different strains that you need
to consider when you're doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to think of it in a
plant-pathogen interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are antibiotics, depending on the
strain that you're using, that eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: will eliminate that bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we don't do that after a
transformation, the agrobacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrows the material and kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also different phases of
growth we need to look at and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we make an overnight culture of
agrobacterium, we'll read the optical
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, it's about a 0.6 to 0.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some species we found,
we have to decrease that by 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using a 0.06 or 0.07 because it's
just very sensitive to the agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can really make or break a plant
transformation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the shuttles that were used in
the agrobacterium to transfer the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the cells, we use electroporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different methods that you can
use to introduce that plasma DNA and that
[SPEAKER_00]: vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find that electroporation works
just fine for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different selectable marker
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go into more detail on
this when I talk about vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are genes that confer resistance
to antibiotic and also herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we include those components,
either an antibiotic or herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: component, into our medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different types and
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to look at timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of parts of this that
you need to look at for your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're working out a new method,
we'll use something called a reporter
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't jump in to just start using our
gene of interest because sometimes genes
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest can have a negative effect on
the regeneration of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start out with these reporter genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one called Gus, which is beta
glucuronidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way this works is that if you have
this in your vector, you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants you recover, you can take
pieces of leaves, put them into an assay
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it turns blue, it's successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it's back to the drawing board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also the green fluorescence
protein, GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing about GFP is as compared to
Gus, when you put your material in Gus,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with GFP, you can actually monitor the
progress of that transformation by using a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to use more GFP
construct vectors in our lab now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other part of the
agrobacterium is the length of time with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're doing a transformation,
say we have those pieces of potato stem
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces, they're just dipped for five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be in the older protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would leave that material in for half
an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that ends up having a negative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stresses the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find that a five-minute dip is
perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes back onto the medium for
two to three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the agrobacterium attaches
to the cells and does the gene transfer at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most often it's in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do all of our co-cultivation in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some reports where they use
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the temperature during that
period is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surprising that around 19 to 22
degrees Celsius works best because,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, it is a soil bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that we've done comparisons of
temperatures and found that that range
[SPEAKER_00]: works the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so for vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some examples of vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the P-Cambi one is a more complicated
diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing the restriction enzymes that
can be used for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a more simplified vector
down here called panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was developed for switchgrass or
panicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're called panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been using these panic vectors
for setaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that on this plasma DNA
there's this segment here that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss a little bit more in the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on that backbone there are also
bacterial-resistant gene for canomycin and
[SPEAKER_00]: also this origin of replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: This origin of replication can also be
very important depending on what plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species you're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that to be true for setaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a closer-up view of a vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here is there is a left
and a right border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the sequence that the
agrobacterium recognizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agrobacterium has endonucleases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the sequences it recognizes
to cut that DNA at those points and
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer it into the plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those vectors also contain promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using these as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of different types of
vectors that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the NOS promoter driving the NPT2
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the NPT2 gene is a selectable marker
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it confers resistance to canomycin,
the antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do our transformation,
we'll put that canomycin into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we do that is, so say we're
doing a tomato transformation and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: cotyledon pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about every cell in that cotyledon
has the potential to go on and to make
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the selectable marker gene,
only the cells that receive that NPT2 gene
[SPEAKER_00]: go on to make plants because we have
canomycin in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't do that, we would have a lot
of plants to screen in order to find those
[SPEAKER_00]: few that are really transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also affect the efficiency of
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do need to include a selectable
marker gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it could be for antibiotic
resistance or herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another promoter that is a common
one called 35S.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put your gene of interest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put Gus there because that's what we
use for developing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then electroporate that into
agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow an overnight culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a transformation experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some tools of the trade for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's overnight cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the electroporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plate it onto the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use toothpicks to transfer those
colonies into the liquid medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a freshly inoculated culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes onto a shaker overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully, you get growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take this solution,
centrifuge it down, we get a pellet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we wash it with a plant tissue culture
medium because the salts that are used for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the bacteria are much too
concentrated and can have a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wash that pellet with a plant-based
culture medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we'll work out the rooting
and acclimation to the greenhouse even
[SPEAKER_00]: before we do transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly don't want to be working out
this out with our precious transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always prefer that we get the rooting
in culture before we transfer it to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sometimes need to use a lower salt
formulation, oxen, something like tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to use any oxen in the
rooting medium because it roots readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there are some systems where we
use activated charcoal because if we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see rooting, there might be an inhibitor
there that's causing it to not root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll use activated charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the acclimation to the greenhouse,
there are a number of factors to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil type, lighting, different plant
species that we work with, we have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that these are some satyria
plants that are covered with water
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that they're covered is
that when we take plants out of culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're in test tubes or they're
in magenta boxes, which are a culture
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like 100% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cuticle isn't well-developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomates are wide open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we transfer those to soil and we
don't cover them, they'll wilt and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had been using plastic bags in the
beginning, but then someone had the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, people in the lab are
drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having bottled water and Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, let's try those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cut the bottoms off the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cover the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few days, we'll simply remove the
cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a few days more,
we'll take off the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wash those bottles and reuse
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much better than plastic bags
because it was difficult to reuse the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to cut holes in the bags to
gradually acclimate them and then discard
[SPEAKER_00]: those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a good supply of bottles in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a listing of the plants that we
have worked with and those that are
[SPEAKER_00]: current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those listed in the black text are those
which are current projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those in red text are ones that we're
doing transformation as a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my group, I have support from BTI
for two and a half people to do
[SPEAKER_00]: transformations as a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way this works is if someone is
interested, say, in tomato, like Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of work for Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give us the construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do the transformations into
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll give them the plants back
for their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fee recovery system because we
have to repay that loan back to BTI for
[SPEAKER_00]: the money that they give us to support
this service component.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other projects in the lab are
funded through different funding agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these in blue text are ones that we
have worked on in the past, but they're no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer active projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought you might be wondering how
long does the whole process take from when
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the infection until I can get plants
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do our transformations as a
service, people are really anxious to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do our best to be able to give them
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they want to know how long it
takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the time, say, for tomato that we
do an infection of the cotyledon pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes about six weeks to go from the
infection phase to having these little
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots regenerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we transfer those shoots to a rooting
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in fruit,
it takes about a total time of five to six
[SPEAKER_00]: months to recover red ripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in just looking at
the plants for disease or insect
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, obviously it's a much shorter
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For potato, it's roughly the same time
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: This month difference here is because some
potatoes take longer in the greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we start with infecting plant
potato stem pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in about eight weeks,
we have these little potato plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can cut and root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll put them into the
greenhouse and produce tubers in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you're just interested in
the plants, it's a much shorter time
[SPEAKER_00]: frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it for your instruction on plant
tissue culture and transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to jump into the three
projects to use those as an example of how
[SPEAKER_00]: we develop those methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, grape is one of the
most recent projects that we have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to work on grapes since we
started the transformation service,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially knowing that grape is such an
important crop in New York State and that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's work going on in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought we could really help those
projects along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this started as a collaboration with
Gan Juan in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he suggested that we work with two
model grape plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is called Pixie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dwarf vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were developed to help
accelerate the grape breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having to go out to the field
and working with vines in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: these lines can be grown in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pixie stays small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sport of Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it's short, it's because
it's a mutant, GAI mutant, and it affects
[SPEAKER_00]: the gibberellum pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants stay small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internodes are very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really dark green leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout is an experimental line that was
released by the USDA and ARS in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flowers continuously in the field and
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how this would be an
advantage for research programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a continuous supply of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was developed by a cross between ruby
red and an Asian species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the makeup here of the scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gan Juan also recommended that we
start working with Concord because,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, it's an important one in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often used to make jellies and
jams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in reading more
about Pixie and Scout, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: publication that was put out by Cornell
that describes the background on that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for grape, there are two possible
sources, based in the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: for starting plant cell cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one is immature inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what works best for wine
grapes and some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method for the leaves from plants in
vitro does not work for the grapes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are used for winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mostly seedless grape types that
work through this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you why they're advantages
to using the leaf system as compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the immature inflorescence system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing our work based on
reports by Gray and Deckney.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start by inducing callus on the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look for something called
somatic embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two ways where plant
regeneration can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a somatic embryogenesis and an
organogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you examples of organogenesis
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for grape, it's through the somatic
embryogenesis mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started this, we ended up
testing 14 different media formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what we found in the literature
to find something to work for scout and
[SPEAKER_00]: concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing pixie yet, but for scout
and concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to look at different salts,
different growth regulators, and other
[SPEAKER_00]: media components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have that callus and we have the
somatic embryos, the somatic embryos,
[SPEAKER_00]: or SE, are transferred to a maintenance
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this maintenance medium contains a
high level of sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucrose generally is around 20 to 30 grams
per liter in a culture medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this medium, we needed a higher
level at 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no growth regulators in the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, your gelling
agent can make or break a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In talking with Dennis Gray, he said it's
very important to use this agar called TC
[SPEAKER_00]: agar throughout the whole system to get a
good response for grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an immature inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an inflorescence from scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a dime who uses a size
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine with that immature
inflorescence the size of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we end up doing with these is we
treat the inflorescence with a bleach
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of dissecting scope work
that has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we need to do is take a bud
from this inflorescence, cut it open,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take out the inside flower parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is most important in this system
is that the filaments stay attached to the
[SPEAKER_00]: anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is where you get the right
type of callus, the callus that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you that embryogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to keep the filament with
the anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is by taking out the
entire part here and putting that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, we were much more successful at
keeping the anther with that filament.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it on a callus induction medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The callus forms at the connective tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that callus, again, we're using a
dissecting scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for these tiny little
white embryos that pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tiny embryos are then moved to that
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually a proliferation medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see all these little embryos,
these somatic embryos that have come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in here, these little ones,
are what we called a pre-embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the somatic embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's these somatic embryos that are
used for the transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really fascinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In kind of a nerdy way by embryos,
by somatic embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're really cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun to work with the systems
where we're getting somatic embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, there's a lot of work
at the scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Kate Pidgeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kate spends a lot of her time taking out
the flower parts, looking for the somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked her to look at the camera to
show that she can still be smiling after
[SPEAKER_00]: all this scope work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in talking with Dennis Gray,
he said that when he gives his protocol to
[SPEAKER_00]: people, and they then say we're having
problems, he finds out that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: using a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to do it without using
a dissecting scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an important part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a close-up of some of the
somatic embryos that are on that
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferation maintenance medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these are more,
I guess you'd lose the term, mature
[SPEAKER_00]: embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down here, and this is a close-up,
these are some of the pre-embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do to keep the embryogenic
system going is, again, we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll select out these tiny little
embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them back onto the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in a black background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the charcoal in the
medium, the activated charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll take these embryos for
transformation and then leave these as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the source for getting more
embryos for our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't done a transformation yet,
but we will be doing one in about three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to be able to bulk up those
somatic embryos until we had enough to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to people I've talked with
and through the literature, what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do is we're going to take one
gram of the scout embryos, the somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: embryos, the more well-developed ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take one gram of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into a liquid medium for two weeks
on a shaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that solution is poured through a
sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller embryos will go back into a
liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll pick off those larger
embryos and use those for transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use an agrobacterium strain
called AGL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: AGL1 is what's called a hypervirulent
agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other virulent agrobacterium out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really difficult to eliminate from
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find that with AGL1, we get a good
transformation efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a problem with eliminating
the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also results in a lot of plants
that are single copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to not have multiple
copies in your transgenic lines of your
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In AGL1, we find that we get a really high
number of single copies, sometimes two
[SPEAKER_00]: copies of the introduced genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the vector, we're going to use the
NPT2 selectable marker gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use GFP because we really want to
monitor the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dennis Gray told me that within a
week, if it worked, we should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the green fluorescence protein
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to hope for the best
and see what happens before we can move
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that another method is for
doing in vitro leaves from in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to use this for Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we decided to use that for
Concord is because getting a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: immature inflorescence was difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only at the right stage one time
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone in Ganwan's group would go out
to the field to get those inflorescences
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganwan lives in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would drive to Ithaca at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would meet him out front at BTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would hand off a box of inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had that one shot at trying all
this different media to get it to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking in the literature to
see what else can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that leaves can possibly use,
as I mentioned before, it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: successful for seedless grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to try it for Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way this works is we take a young
shoot from Concord plants, which actually
[SPEAKER_00]: we have now growing in the greenhouse,
and then more dissecting work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go in here and take out the small
apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That apical meristem goes onto a medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this plant is bigger,
we'll go ahead and we'll take those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them on a callus induction medium
and see if we can get embryos that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, we can have more of a supply of
material to bulk up the somatic embryos
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need for our transformations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you some of the next steps
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on Asclepias with Honorog at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose is developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honorog is interested, and he thinks that
the community would be interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: having milkweed as a model system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transformation is an important part of
that, being a model system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He identified seven different species
based on their chemical composition and
[SPEAKER_00]: their insect interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with these seven different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to be able to use in
vitro grown plants so they would be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have to worry about cleaning
up leaf or stem material every time we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do a transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we couldn't get them to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: The milkweed just would not root in
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it used to kill me when I'd be on a
walk and I'd see a milkweed growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: space between the sidewalk and a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going perfectly fine there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get you to root in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could give a whole seminar on what we
tried for rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just gave up and we said,
all right, we're going to have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material grown in a growth chamber
or a greenhouse for our starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning it up was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a challenge finding that kind of
sweet spot where it cleans up the
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination but yet doesn't kill the
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing more disconcerting as
coming in and seeing a fungus growing all
[SPEAKER_00]: over your plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some images of the species
that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the common one that you might be
familiar with, that the monarch butterfly
[SPEAKER_00]: goes through its life cycle on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is atuberosa or butterflyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some other images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually started a milkweed garden at
home because they're really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the kurosavaka.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how we get to see them on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the stem pieces that are
making callus on this callus induction
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the scopes to scan that callus to
look for the starts of plant regeneration
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure we're on the right track with
everything that we're trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we see something like this,
we get really excited because this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the production of shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unlike grape, which is somatic
embryogenesis, this is organogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we see this, we know that we're
getting to that point where we could
[SPEAKER_00]: recover plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're full and they're
actually roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was pretty exciting after trying
all sorts of different methods that we
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with these little shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because working with seven different
species was difficult in plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and regeneration, there's a
definite genetic component to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species, even closely related species,
they require different conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to just focus on the three
now that gave us the plant regeneration
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: A key part of the medium, we're using an
antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use DTT.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used an agrobacterium strain,
LVA 4404.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing some gust response in the
cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done some recent real gene
transformations where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking down Koi 1 expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Koi 1 is involved in defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, Amy, who works on the
project, is doing characterization to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how far down that Koi 1 is knocked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll continue doing
transformations with the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last project I'm going to talk about
is the Ceteria viridis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This started out as a collaboration with
Tom Brutnell when he was at BTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, the interest is
because it's a model species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a small stature compared to
something like maize, sorghum,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a C4 photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a phylogeny of the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceteria viridis is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wild relative of the cultivated
foxtail millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a close relative of switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of attributes that make it
attractive for a model species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small stature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow a lot of plants, kind of like
the Arabidopsis or the dicot world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow a lot of plants in a small
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really we needed at this point
was to have a transformation method worked
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tom asked me if I was interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take on that challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I went to the literature
first to see if there was anything
[SPEAKER_00]: reported for viridis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were reports for its cultivated
relative, italica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started with mature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with viridis is there's a
dormancy issue if the seeds are younger
[SPEAKER_00]: than three months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that we had to break the
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried all sorts of methods to break the
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what worked out the best was removing
the seed coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you in the next couple of
slides how we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are then cultured on a callus
induction medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then clean up the coleoptiles and the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we transfer that to fresh medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, the importance
of gelling agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started out, in the italica
reports, they used agar in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were getting with viridis was
this really sticky, gelatinous,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-regenerable callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really wanted was this more
defined callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew from my prior experience with
monocots that sometimes a gel and gum,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case phytogel, actually works
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we switched to that phytogel,
we recovered more of this more
[SPEAKER_00]: well-defined, regenerable callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't ask for anything better for
plant regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about every piece of callus
regenerates multiple shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took one shoot and put it on rooting
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rooted well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tillered a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that we were now ready to do
plant transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, to remove the seed
coats, we came up with this really simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a rubber stopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some ridged plastic material out of
my kitchen drawers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take the seeds and we rub that
rubber stopper over the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were concerned that maybe it would
break a lot of the seeds and wouldn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: good germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got close to 100% germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is where more patience comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are selected away from those
that have the seed coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we use for the callus
induction medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the transformation, we started with
this vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This vector has a gene for hygromycin
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: NPT2 and cannomycin don't work that well
for monocots as compared to dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We infect the callus with the
agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then go to a selective regeneration
medium that has hygromycin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very happy day in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our non-transformed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it in gusts, no blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we put one of the putative
transformers into gust solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: it turned blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing some leaf material
from a control did not turn blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some leaves from some older
transgenic lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, we used that
selectable marker gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we didn't, this is what we
would end up with after we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would have to analyze a lot of
plants in order to find these precious
[SPEAKER_00]: few.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are really transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see if we could get this to
persist into the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let some of those transgenic lines
go on to make seed, threw them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, harvested that next
generation, which is called the T1,
[SPEAKER_00]: assayed them for gusts using the assay
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, again, non-transformed
control and gusts expression in those
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a timeline for how long the
whole process takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From culturing the seed on callus medium
to having seeds harvested from your
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic lines takes about 21 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we had that callus already,
we could cut off six weeks off that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with monocots, it's really difficult
to maintain callus long term and still
[SPEAKER_00]: have it maintain that high regenerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do get regenerants,
you sometimes see a large percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: albinos because the transposons are
activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided to try it with sataria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, what we've seen is we're just
testing taking callus, keeping it long
[SPEAKER_00]: term, and putting it on regeneration
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be acting differently than
maize or rice callus in that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that hit on plant regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to try some of that
longer term callus for transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have time to talk about our CRISPR work
in sataria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have tried genome editing by
targeting this flowering time gene called
[SPEAKER_00]: indeterminate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is that these
are the controls, empty vector,
[SPEAKER_00]: no target in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two lines that were
recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a definite difference
in the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really good indication
phenotypically that we hit the right gene
[SPEAKER_00]: and that it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the lines now, both the primary
ones and progeny, are being analyzed to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what time types of mutations we had
and the frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a lot of fun working with the
CRISPR-Cas9 systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, I hope I've impressed upon
you all the work that it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people don't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a transformation service,
and they're like, what's taking so long?
[SPEAKER_00]: How come we don't have our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there really is a lot of work that
goes into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a great group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we are successful in what
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next steps for grape,
we are going to do what I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: the transformation with GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we have enough embryos from
Concord, we're going to try transformation
[SPEAKER_00]: of Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Asclepias, we'll characterize
those COI-1 knockdown lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to recover more of those
so we can have different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: expression and different transgenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improve the rooting in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given up on in vitro rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at rooting in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's better than what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also starting to work on the
other species of the seven species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Ceterioviridis, we're actually looking
at other accessions besides the A10.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mentioned that there's a genetic
component to plant regeneration and also
[SPEAKER_00]: for transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we feel that if we can find
another accession where we can get higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than 5% to 20% transformation efficiency,
that would make it more high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the long-term callus
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can cut off about six weeks off
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to expand our genome
editing efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, we're just using it for a
mutagenesis to knock out genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at some of the new
CRISPR technologies that have come along
[SPEAKER_00]: to activate endogenous genes and do some
gene replacement in those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing that both in Ceteria and
in tomato as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I have acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my group who make it all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm patient and just put up with some of
my crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, Amy is working with an Honorogs
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works with us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very talented.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gan Wong's group who have been
helping us with the grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group at Danforth Center and in
Minnesota have been involved in the CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: work with Ceteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a collaboration with the group
at the John Innes Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that funding has helped
support our improvement of Ceteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're using Ceteria as a model
for that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the sources of funding for
our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicago takes a long time to go from
start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most difficult parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one genotype that works best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the beginning, we had some problems
because they were recommending,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the groups was recommending using
this EHA 105, super virulent
[SPEAKER_00]: agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we lost a lot of material from
overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we switched to AGL1, we were able
to eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you're working with that one
particular genotype and you're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for quite a while, it's workable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as easy as tomato, but doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what I've seen in the reports,
it's a chemical composition, but also a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical composition to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds the divalic cations, magnesium
and calcium, in order to gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned this the hard way when I was
a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying some experiments with a
gelling agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, why should I make up a whole
batch of salt, medium with salts in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just use water in the gelling agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't get it to gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, why isn't it gelling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Agrogel's in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I did some more searching,
I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out that you do need some of the
salts in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something like tomato does not do well
on the gelling gums because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have those calcium and magnesium ions
available to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we end up having to use an agrobase for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's a chemical and a physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it has to do with concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at that also, not just the type.
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to your charcoal, I can see
why you put that in to pull out some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the phenolics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But doesn't it also bind some of the
hormone material?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're working with a medium and we
see that IAA works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Peter was wondering, you asked about
the activated charcoal, that it can also
[SPEAKER_00]: bind some of the hormones in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find that it will work out a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find out that something like IAA at
a certain concentration works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we then decide, oh, there's some
browning, or we want rooting, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to using activated charcoal,
we don't see the same response as we did
[SPEAKER_00]: with the original concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have to bump that up and look
at other concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it can have an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the monarch butterfly feed on any of
the species of milkweed that you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ask because they say monarch
butterflies are declining because people
[SPEAKER_02]: are destroying milkweed in their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know if it does on other
milkweeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it uses that one primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know about the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm planting it in my garden now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people think it can be a weed in
some gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy across the street has wild
milkweed, and it's just spewing this white
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be pretty messy, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind anything for the monarch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jin is asking about ploidy level in the
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we go through that callus and
regeneration, can that have an effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plant species are more prone to
it than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see, I think, something like
pineapple, where you'll see more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: ploidy problem in regeneration and
transformation than some other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what some people are doing is doing
chromosome counts or doing some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis to see what the ploidy level is
in the resulting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be aware of that for some
plant species, because it can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a follow-up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever use pollen to get a half-ploid
count?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have done cultures to be able to
get half-ploid material and using pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: or culturing anthers at a certain stage
with the pollen development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a project with Rice where we
were developing half-ploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I was talking with a grape
breeder just yesterday who asked me if we
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider doing that with grape,
is looking at half-ploids for grape and
[SPEAKER_00]: using a pollen system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because grape is such a heterozygous
material, it makes it difficult for both
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing and for doing their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they had a half-ploid-type grape,
that it would really help advance their
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take some work to try to get
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do any maize or rice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did maize as an undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was enough of an exposure to
maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, I kind of enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at certain times of the year,
they would pull everybody into a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an undergraduate work-study student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for maize, the starting material are
immature embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have the plants at a
certain stage to have these immature ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you do is you cut the
kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scoop out the little immature embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on how it's oriented that
you'll get the right type of callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started our transformation
service, someone, David Stern,
[SPEAKER_00]: said, well, what about doing maize?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, that's really tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you basically have to dedicate
greenhouse space to have the plants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get your ears, to get your
immature embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of becomes financially
difficult, space difficult, to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you grow those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have any requests for doing
the transformations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to have that constant supply
of ears.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the difference between maize and
cetaria, then, if you can use cetaria with
[SPEAKER_04]: the seed, but not from any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's something genetic and
physiological about maize versus cetaria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And rice?
[SPEAKER_00]: And rice, you can start with mature seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mature seed, you culture it like
cetaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get that embryogenic callus from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone asked me, have you considered
doing immature embryos from cetaria?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw how small those seeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I think I'd have a mutiny on
my hands in the lab if I asked people to
[SPEAKER_00]: take immature embryos out of those small
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, like rice, the mature
seeds for cetaria work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did rice as part of an NSF project
a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't been asked otherwise here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so nobody has asked us to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did when David asked me to
start up the transformation service as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my research program, I talked to
the project leaders at BTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what are you interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of crops would be important for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we based it on their interest first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that time, we've done work for
people at Cornell and also outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rice hasn't been one of those that
we've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember which species of what.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used the filaments.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any particular cell that's giving
rise?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know if anyone has looked at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like in rice, they've shown,
and in maize as well, is the scutellum,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the callus originates from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure there's got to be a particular
cell type in that connective tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I ask, too, is because when I
want a cell, but we fail because we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have the right stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we can always look at are the shape
of the nuclei in the film.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such a variety of shapes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there must be something to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In March, it was announced that all
cultivated sweet potatoes have the genes
[SPEAKER_01]: for agrobacterium in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thrilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: What possible advantage could
agrobacterium have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wondered the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it through?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not a wild species, but the more
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a recent paper that showed
actually some of the International Potato
[SPEAKER_00]: Center, where they were looking at sweet
potato and doing transcription profiling
[SPEAKER_00]: to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found sequences from
agrobacterium in some of the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they tested like 300 different
types of sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 291.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was every variety that they
tested that was a cultivating variety,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not the wild ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must have been some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the cultivated ones or the
wild ones had some sort of resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: the infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivated ones, that resistance broke
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's an evolutionary
benefit for the agrobacterium and the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet potato cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was happy because I thought,
OK, what are they going to do about GMOs
[SPEAKER_00]: now with sweet potatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have these components.
[SPEAKER_00]: With agrobacterium, how are they going to
classify that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's incorporated into the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true for mistletoes and oaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's at least five different segments
of the oak host that's now integrated into
[SPEAKER_04]: the mistletoe genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might be this kind of notion of
recognizing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How easy are sweet potatoes to transform?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the tuber and mix it with agro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've got to get plants back from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't worked with sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think certain species are easier
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might be more amenable to it.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
