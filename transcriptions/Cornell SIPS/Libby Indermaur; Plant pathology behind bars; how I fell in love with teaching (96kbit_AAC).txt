[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bill, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that I would start with an
introduction of the program that made the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that I'll be telling you about
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this previous spring, I was a teaching
assistant with the Cornell Prison
[SPEAKER_00]: Education Program, or CPEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'll refer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a program that was founded at the
university in 2013, and really motivated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the same founding principle of the
university, that I would found an
[SPEAKER_00]: institution where any person can find
instruction in any study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that end, they are dedicated to
supporting incarcerated persons' academic
[SPEAKER_00]: ambitions and their preparation for
successful reentry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CPEP operates in facilities that are
managed by the Department of Corrections
[SPEAKER_00]: and Community Supervision, or DOCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'll be referring to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, they offer associates of arts
degrees to men who are incarcerated at
[SPEAKER_00]: four correctional facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're shown here in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: All are within an hour's drive of main
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to emphasize just how
humanity's dominant the program is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a given student's program, there might
be five STEM classes that they could take
[SPEAKER_00]: to get their associates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unsurprisingly, plant pathology is not
a staple course in their curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of depends on the bill's schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a medium security state prison for
men capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has just over 1,000 incarcerated
individuals, or IIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the DOCS terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a given semester, there could be
between 30 and 40 IIs who have applied for
[SPEAKER_00]: and are accepted and enrolled in CPEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also unsurprisingly, there aren't a
lot of publicly available pictures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a Google Earth image that I put
here to try to illustrate what it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: like to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the wall around the grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the parking lot where if you were
a volunteer or a staff member,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd enter through this
administrative building, go through a
[SPEAKER_00]: thorough security screening process,
metal detector, get your prison ID,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then be escorted through a series of
gates onto the grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a volunteer, you are
immediately escorted directly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: school building here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the only building you
would see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting as a teaching assistant,
there were two trainings that I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through DOCS and one through CPEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really designed to set the
tone really to scare you, one maybe more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the other, I think as you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to share the most impactful
lessons from the training before I get
[SPEAKER_00]: started with the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the DOCS training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon entering the facility, you will be
directed to pass through a metal detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be hand stamped, and you may be
subjected to additional search procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: All items will be inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matters of discipline are the
responsibility of the security staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under no circumstances should you
interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not bring into the facility any items
that might be defined as contraband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Promoting prison contraband is a felony
offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes anything that is introduced
with the intent to transfer to an II
[SPEAKER_00]: without the permission of the
superintendent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I later learned that it's not always a
felony offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at least a misdemeanor if you bring
in prison contraband.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be a felony offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will not be working with students.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be working with IIs who are
taking the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the CPEP training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prison is to outsiders a foreign country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is wise to be quiet, observe,
listen, learn the language, and identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the values of the prison culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to define yourself
clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not required to conform to any
stereotype IIs may have about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after you have clearly defined
yourself, expect to be tested again and
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect to meet many tremendous and
valuable people in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect also to meet some champion
manipulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not be surprised if these sometimes
turn out to be one in the same person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prisons have proven that people do not
learn very much from punishment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more from example.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do in prison is more important
than what you say there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A broken promise to an incarcerated person
is even more painful than a normal life,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is an act of cruelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if after an initial exposure,
you find yourself fearful of the prison
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you should not continue to go
into prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pretty apprehensive after the
trainings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had already signed up to work with
Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had talked about the plans for the
semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really reassured by the fact
that Bill was a seasoned CPEP volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the class that I was a teaching
assistant for was PLSCI 2225, Healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, Healthy Planet, Healthy People.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top I, our very own Bill Fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were three major learning
outcomes for the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, that students would acquire a broad
understanding of plant diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: their pathogens, and how to manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To explain plant disease dynamics at the
cellular, organismal, and population
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, to illustrate their
understanding and their knowledge in a
[SPEAKER_00]: term paper, describing five important and
diverse diseases on a crop of their
[SPEAKER_00]: choice, and how to manage them in an
integrated way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also had a personal goal for this
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was to determine what role I want
teaching to play in my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the last year of my graduate
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had some teaching experiences
before at NC State and here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But comparably, in ideal environments with
inexhaustible resources and not really,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sort of, and professional students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted a different representation
of what teaching could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we met once a week on Tuesday mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long and engaging three hour period
from 750 to 1050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days we could go in like on Mondays,
depending on cancellations or if we were
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do a study hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually it was just once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to hold attention for three
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily a class that I would be
excited to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to emphasize how limited of a
classroom it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had no PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no screens or computers or phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And absolutely no samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no microscopes, no slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't bring in plant samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't even bring in rotten produce
from the mess hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing to point to other than
our chalkboard and phase four resources
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could bring in these printouts of
PDFs, conversions of PowerPoints as the
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had these spiral bound readers as
companions to the lecture material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were filled with articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each student had a disease compendium or
the crop on which they were writing their
[SPEAKER_00]: term papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every student had a copy of the
agrios text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was our classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me on first glance, it doesn't really
look too different from your regular sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of underfunded public school classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like where I went to high
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are bars on the windows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can't see here is a wall of
windows for observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the chalkboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the total lack of modern
resources in a classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had five students in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one dropped out about halfway through
the semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the three students who were
comfortable with their photos being taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had their permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were around between 30 to 60 years
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outside of CPEP they had no
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: With college level education or
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that what they did have ample
experience with was how frightening the
[SPEAKER_00]: prison environment can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to what it was like outside
of the school building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found even in the school building it
to be a very intimidating place to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for a young woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correctional officers have every power to
question your motivations for
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And demand a response to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To deny you entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to interrupt class with a canine unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pull the students out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frisk them along the wall of windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standing there watching you from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that all of that was going to
happen to them in the school building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still registered for a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let alone a plant pathology class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the students said that they
registered because they needed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they heard that it was challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was one student.
[SPEAKER_00]: This student who said that he registered
for the class because his mom is a master
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to spend more time on his
weekly phone calls with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about what she was interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought that our class could help
him do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing all of this Bill and I took an
intentional approach to the semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did first and very often was
empathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We emphasized that everything that they
will be learning is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the ridiculous scientific names
that we were asking them to memorize and
[SPEAKER_00]: spell correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diseases that are caused by those
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The economic losses that result from those
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all of that is very, very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't show them that we're asking
them to trust us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used phytophthora infestans as a
teaching model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was in large part because of
Bill's career-long expertise with the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a lot of material to pull from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also thought that if we stayed
within one system to teach major concepts
[SPEAKER_00]: like Koch's postulates and life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidemiology, post-resistance and
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That for people who were hearing it for
the very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that might make more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially then when we transitioned to
talk about other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had them read the first two
chapters of The Advance of the Fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: before we even met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which they all read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're familiar with the text,
it really sets the tone for phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: infestans as a devastating pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think helped sort of establish where
we would be for the semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed a sort of standard layout for
each class over the course of the
[SPEAKER_00]: semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always began by answering what
questions they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally about the lecture material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we would review a list of important
terms and summary notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bill and I would compile the terms
from the previous week and hand them out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the students the following week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make sure to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the information that we want you
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make sure everyone had access to
the same information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some examples of the
summary notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we spent the rest of the time
discussing lecture material and reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always ended with a debriefing
session with Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two sort of strategies that
we utilized a lot in the semester that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to share with you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was that we sat in as much of a
circle as we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classroom was small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't quite arrange our desks and
chairs that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did it as best as we could as this
picture shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would take turns going to the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in many cases, no one was standing
up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all in a circle sort of
equally participating in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion we were having.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Bill went to the board,
then I was asking questions of him as a
[SPEAKER_00]: student trying to model for the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the kinds of interactions that
we are hoping that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the kinds of questions we hope
you're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, I thought we were
successful in getting a dynamic classroom
[SPEAKER_00]: where students appeared to feel very free
to share when they were frustrated and
[SPEAKER_00]: confused and excited to help each other,
to challenge each other, and to challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the end, really,
as I was hoping that this picture would
[SPEAKER_00]: show for you all that we had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that felt like one of the most
important things that we could be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other strategy that we used,
well, I guess problem we were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: address was how to give the students
hands-on learning experiences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: absence of a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we ended up relying on was
getting students to come to the chalkboard
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as possible to diagram a life
cycle, which is the case here,
[SPEAKER_00]: or to draw a disease progress curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was that if a student were at
the board, they were not solely
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for diagraming whatever they
were diagraming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were relying on the people in the
classroom to guide them through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a low stakes environment for the
person at the board and a mentoring
[SPEAKER_00]: learning opportunity for people in the
classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came about this not because we
thought of it on our own, but because in
[SPEAKER_00]: the second week of class, we had sort of
fallen told a student to go to the board
[SPEAKER_00]: to diagram the P. Infestans life cycle,
which he did fairly begrudgingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with some amount of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when he was on his way back to
his seat, he stopped and turned to us and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, that was the most I've learned in
this class so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could come up with all of these,
what we thought were innovative and
[SPEAKER_00]: creative ways to teach the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least for that student,
what mattered was going to the board and
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to illustrate understanding,
but to cement understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had mentioned that after the course,
Bill and I would have our debriefing
[SPEAKER_00]: session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't an office for us in the
prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were escorted out at the end of class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went to our next best option,
which was a Speedway gas station a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of miles down the road, because it had
this mini Dunkin Donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had literally just two tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every Tuesday, late morning,
this is where we would be debriefing about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we had experienced, mostly because it
was jarring, but meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also where we would grade quizzes
and come up with the summary term list for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an unlikely place for me to realize
the sort of mentor that Bill is and to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a relationship with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that was happening over the
course of the semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the very end, we had the term
papers due.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked the students to give
presentations on the term papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we told them that we wanted lightning
talks, five to 10 minutes, no more than 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be sufficient for them to
introduce a pathogen of five pathogens on
[SPEAKER_00]: their crop and how to manage them in an
integrated way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, each student took about 45
minutes to give their presentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we did not expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took two classes to actually go
through the four presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that this was probably for
many of the students the first time that
[SPEAKER_00]: they gave a presentation to a respectful
and attentive audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the student whose mother is a master
gardener in Oklahoma wrote his term paper
[SPEAKER_00]: on the biology and management of peach
tree diseases, because that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important crop to his mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to connect with her
throughout the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really touched by her
involvement in his success in the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had her mail him these printed color
photos of symptoms of the diseases that he
[SPEAKER_00]: was studying in his paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only was the student really
invested in his success, but also his
[SPEAKER_00]: family in contributing something as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to spend the rest of the time
talking about some lessons that I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: from the experience and then close with
some reflections from the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to say first that this was
the single most impactful experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had all in grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would encourage really anyone at
Cornell because of CPAP here, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: especially graduate students to say yes to
an unlikely teaching opportunity like this
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the importance of trying to be
precise and concise and to seek narrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, and unambiguous words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this was especially important
when the students you're teaching are
[SPEAKER_00]: learning it for the very first time and
have little to no ability to check you on
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also learned that I should admit often
what I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I knew things that I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ego got in the way very quickly in the
classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, I was very concerned
with seeming like I was a good resource to
[SPEAKER_00]: the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I knew all the information really,
really well and found that I could be far
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective as an instructor to them if
I were more honest than I was insecure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in light of that, I have a
vulnerable anecdote about thinking that I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew things that I didn't that I wanted to
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a third of the way through the
semester, Bill asked me if I would teach
[SPEAKER_00]: the students mitosis and meiosis,
give a lecture on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've studied subjects for years now that
deal with some element of mitosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel comfortable giving a meaningful
lecture to the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was spending the couple of weeks
preparing for the lecture, I was thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about what I would say are the core
concepts of cell division that come to
[SPEAKER_00]: mind very quickly for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's how I'll inform the
lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'll share with the
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those concepts was this notion
I had that meiosis results in the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that that would be a core
concept I would teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we had used P. infestans as a
model up to this point, I thought I would
[SPEAKER_00]: teach the subjects through the P.
infestans life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got up to the board and I drew the
scaffolding of this table comparing and
[SPEAKER_00]: contrasting mitosis and meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told the students I'm going to walk
through the life cycle and at each stage
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about how mitosis or meiosis plays a
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I distinguished the two here
saying that in this system, meiosis
[SPEAKER_00]: results in the production of gametes and
mitosis does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was concise and
precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the students also thought
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was where we left it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bill didn't say anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of weeks later,
Bill was introducing Ascomycete fungi to
[SPEAKER_00]: the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was walking through the generalized
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got to sexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said something like, you have
compatible hyphae that undergo plasmodomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with multiple haploid
nuclei in a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those multiple haploid nuclei undergo
rounds of mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, two haploid nuclei
fuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very briefly, you have a diploid
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that nucleus undergoes meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, there's another round
of mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get four sets of twins,
your classic haploid eight askospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the life cycle continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was nodding along and drafting my
summary notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yes, of course, this is what I've
always learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was thinking about what I had
been telling the students previously about
[SPEAKER_00]: mitosis and meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at this in my notes and
looking at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Ascomycetes, meiosis does not result in
the production of gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in the zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because meiosis happens in the zygote,
the dominant nuclear state for the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the life cycle is haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how fundamentally different that is
from all organisms where meiosis occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: before parental nuclei are donated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, surely I knew this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I get to this point in graduate
school?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just now making sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now feeling very important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't people talk about this all the
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a level of difference that I
didn't appreciate between organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the students had created this
environment where it was not shameful to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit having not appreciated something and
now appreciating something, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: help but do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope I'm illustrating to you the
dynamic in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels very vulnerable to admit this to
a room of very real subject matter
[SPEAKER_00]: experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that was an experience I had
where I admitted what I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also learned that teaching added
dimension to my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it hindered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it only enhanced the
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another little anecdote I
wanted to share related to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill had mentioned that for my
research, part of what I do is I am
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizing diseases of rhubarb,
primarily those that we think are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really that has led me to characterize
a single fungal pathogen that causes leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: spots that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is going on before I'm a TA
and while I'm a TA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe two thirds through the semester,
Bill asked me if I would teach the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematology lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agreed with some hesitation because
I thought I should admit that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know anything of the subject to
give a meaningful lecture to these
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a couple of weeks preparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while doing so and then while giving
the lecture, I realized that I found
[SPEAKER_00]: dagger nematodes and their ability to
transmit nepoviruses to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somehow I had ignored this in
previous plant pathology classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I not know that this was very
cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cool to me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, our lab started
growing out a number of rhubarb accessions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greenhouse that were previously in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had sort of closer eyes on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they were growing out,
I realized that in a single accession in
[SPEAKER_00]: our collection, there were these curious
symptoms that initially resembled the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: spot symptoms that I had seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are clones of each other,
these two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried to isolate from these leaf
spots the same pathogen that I know causes
[SPEAKER_00]: these leaf spots unsuccessfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I approached Mark Fuchs and asked him
if he thought that any of these were worth
[SPEAKER_00]: screening for a number of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, I have gone to Mark
Fuchs many, many times with what I think
[SPEAKER_00]: are really cool symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping that it's caused by some virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always says, no, it's not worth
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was very exciting for me when he
said, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's screen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found has resulted in a new
project and a collaboration that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have never thought that I would have as a
graduate student studying fungal pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found tomato ring spot virus,
which is a nepovirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this accession causing or showing at
least these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that motivated a further collaboration
with members of Mark's lab and a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborator at an institution that I
didn't think that I would be collaborating
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: High throughput sequencing of RNA project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some interesting results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next step is validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm not trying to say that
it's because I was realizing that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in nepoviruses as a TA that I
happened to find a nepovirus in rhubarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was that I had learned enough to be
interested in the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it made something like this seem
worthwhile last minute as an unplanned
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also learned that any expectation I have
of the students, I'll have of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want the students, if I expect
them to be interested in something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to demonstrate that I am interested
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want them to spend time on something,
I should demonstrate that I have spent
[SPEAKER_00]: time on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also learned that I should expect an
experience to be interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I may be better prepared to
appreciate it when it likely will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned that I should be affected by
the people I teach and to let them know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm affected by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a written reflection at the end of the
semester, one student said, I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get out and bump into two people
more in my life so I can shake their
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only for what they did for me
academically, but for treating me like a
[SPEAKER_00]: human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it mattered what we were teaching them
and how we were teaching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think that we could have been
teaching them anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that we cared about them that
mattered the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some students comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started this class by telling us that
everything we'd learned is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potato, spindle, tuber, viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing that I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have never thought I'd say that
before taking this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one student in talking about preparing
for an exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that I can walk the yard with
murderers and thieves and have less
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety than I do in this class?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not what we meant to have
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the disease triangle to explain
recidivism with my reentry program
[SPEAKER_00]: mentees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came here because of some interaction
between their behavior, their needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and their support system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to change least one to keep from
coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never look at a piece of fruit,
vegetable, or food the same way again,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that a grower's many efforts
somewhere along the line have made that
[SPEAKER_00]: resource available to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to show my family this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to report that a number of the
students in our class graduated this
[SPEAKER_00]: semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those who are still incarcerated will
continue taking classes through CPEP as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as they're offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care a lot about this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, really appreciate the people
in this picture with me, especially Bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: for making this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's some questions for Libby.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get us started, I have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you compare your Cornell
undergrads with CCF?
[SPEAKER_03]: Undergrads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would I compare the students in the
CPEP program with students I've taught at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a major, major difference in the
background education with the students at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell versus students at CPEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The understanding of plant science of DNA,
of biology broadly, that was a surprise
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The students at CPEP did not have a strong
understanding, but they had almost no
[SPEAKER_00]: desire, I think, to prove themselves to
each other, perhaps in the way that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: observed with undergrads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I had found really meaningful about
the experience is something I had talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about was that the environment in the
classroom, it was very free and willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit when you didn't understand
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as a TA in Cornell classes,
I would have been very scared to say to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone that I had just appreciated that
meiosis occurs in the zygote, in
[SPEAKER_00]: escomycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was totally welcome in a CPEP
classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a prison program for women?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a prison program for women.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that CPEP currently
does not operate in women's prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if there is a reason for
that in addition to maybe they are too far
[SPEAKER_00]: away for people to volunteer at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know where the nearest
women's prison is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other universities have prison education
programs at women's prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, Brown operates in some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia has a program, but not Cornell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect for a talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to follow up on Bill's
question, actually, comparing the
[SPEAKER_01]: students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I understand correctly, these
students in the prison are not really
[SPEAKER_01]: having the type of background that's
really needed to go into advanced topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're actually teaching them pretty
specific terms and technologies and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do your observations do these students
react to the frustration compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: other, like Brown or grad school have more
background?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Igor, your question was about comparing
perhaps how students react in CPEP versus
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell to not understanding a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if their frustration ever elevated a
situation to a point of concern,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that there were many times
where students were frustrated by not
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding a subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would just slow the class down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with five students, and eventually
then four, it was very easy to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone was on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often turned to each other for
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would tutor each other outside of
the class if they had recognized that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone wasn't understanding something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never any concern that I had
about safety in the classroom once I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable, not at first, but eventually
after I learned the students and knew who
[SPEAKER_00]: they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they handled frustration with a
subject, I think, similar to how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have expected Cornell students to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that some of your early summary
notes had graphs in them, like area under
[SPEAKER_02]: the disease progress curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking of my magical mushroom
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I put up a graph, I have to be
like, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you explain the area under the
disease progress curve?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we explain the charts and figures?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of repetition at the
chalkboard and getting the students to
[SPEAKER_00]: draw it out themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, some.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were examples where we spent maybe
two weeks on disease progress curves and
[SPEAKER_00]: exponential growth and trying to compare
exponential growth to maybe how they might
[SPEAKER_00]: have thought about their finances before
and what happens in a savings account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that maybe wasn't as helpful as I
thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But walking them through individual
calculations, getting them to debate each
[SPEAKER_00]: other on what they thought the outcome
would be and then argue their case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say one more thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked your reflection on
intellectual humility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to say that into the mic for
the Zoom folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you come before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one is on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not giving this seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to say, this is Kathy Hodge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say that I really liked your
reflection on intellectual humility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a really good attribute
to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you think about it, we're all
just learning all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were curious about the things we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think when students first graduate
often with a PhD, I think you feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: you should be an expert on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still feel like I'm supposed to be
an expert on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, I got here for the very
opposite reason, that I didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to learn more and more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that intellectual
humility, like you've shown, is just a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful way to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let people in and just recruit them to the
process of science.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if somebody asks you a question
that you don't know the answer to,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, that's a beautiful moment if
you can say, that's a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to say anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was, I think, very much the
dynamic that I experienced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to say one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Libby first started, I really did not
know that you were apprehensive about
[SPEAKER_04]: going into the prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm not very observant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you compare your, just describe your
experience early on with that later on?
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we could stop with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in the first month or so of the
semester, I tried really hard to hide this
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't really sleep the nights
before going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very afraid of what version of a
correctional officer I was going to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: at the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had heard sort of horror stories about
previous volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This didn't happen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your shirt was too tight, so you can't
come in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're wearing a white shirt,
and it's going to rain, so you can't come
[SPEAKER_00]: in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you sure you're a volunteer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have your name on the
list, even though you've been there for
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to have someone come over
and look at your identifying information
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you can go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was really scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply to enter the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time that you took a
bathroom break in lecture, and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting alone with the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was our first class, and I didn't
know anything about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't know anything about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so afraid that all they could
see was that I was young and a woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very wrong about that in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end, I think somehow we achieved
another sort of classroom dimension that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't exist in the prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd walk through the prison,
but get to class, and it was a classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could have been anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it very much changed by the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Libby, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
