[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be giving a seminar in this
friendly environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a photograph showing
Pseudomonas syringae on the surface of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the photograph comes from Sheng Yang
He's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I particularly like this photograph
because it shows or implies this action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Pseudomonas syringae is sort of
homing in on this open stomata where it
[SPEAKER_00]: will gain access to the interior of the
leaf and where it performs best in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we study it mostly in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, Pseudomonas syringae is
adapted to live all over the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically found on every terrestrial
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on plants, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's found in clear spring mountain
streams high above any human habitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it's also in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pseudomonas syringae can rain back down
to earth in rain or in snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all of these environments,
it takes special adaptations to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In syringae, each one of these cells
encodes all of the capabilities needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive in all of those environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the disease cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cycle begins by the bacteria making
contact with the surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, it tends to collect in parts of
the leaf where it has access to the most
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of nutrients, like around the base
of glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has systems to allow it to move and
home in on stomata and enter into the
[SPEAKER_00]: interior of the plant leaf where it can
grow to high density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this process, the entry and moving
into the pathogenic growth that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to describe a particular system
that allows the bacteria to sense that it
[SPEAKER_00]: enters into the plant and move into a
stealth mode of growth so that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: escape detection by the plant immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that I'm going to describe was
done by many, many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, I want to mention Eric
Markle today because, as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he passed away February 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photograph of Eric working at
the Freeville farm where we're collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: plant epiphytes to see how they interact
with syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric was a really great guy and a great
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to say that we met with Eric's
family a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his family was very appreciative of
the support that they got from the people
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do bacteria sense their
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: They use these signal transduction
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their simplest form, they have at
least two proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a membrane-bound protein that spans
the cytoplasmic membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's able to sense changes in the
periplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes there are systems that allow
external conditions to be transduced into
[SPEAKER_00]: the periplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this membrane protein interacts
with a cytoplasmic protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can activate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes on to activate gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two classes of signal
transduction systems in bacteria that fall
[SPEAKER_00]: into this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the two component regulators and
the ECF sigma factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on the sigma factors
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sigma factors are a component of RNA
polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the part of RNA polymerase that
gives it the DNA binding specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what helps RNA polymerase begin
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do so by recognizing sequences in
the DNA upstream of the location where
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, sigma factors are
exchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any individual bacterium will encode
many sigma factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by exchanging the sigma factor,
it changes the DNA recognition specificity
[SPEAKER_00]: and so changes the groups of genes that
are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: DC3000 encodes 15 sigma factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are involved with sensing
external conditions are these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: colored ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may recognize HARP-L.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HARP-L is an ECF sigma factor that's
responsible for the expression of the type
[SPEAKER_00]: III secretion system and all of the type
III dependent effectors that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today we're going to focus in on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Algeo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ortholog of RPOE in the enterics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algeo was discovered in the Pseudomonas
because of its role in regulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of alginate, which is an
exopolysaccharide that's secreted outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bacteria and forms part of the
extracellular matrix surrounding the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and provides some resistance to
stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what alginate looks like when
it's expressed in Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're driving overexpression of Algeo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's causing the bacteria to be
hyper-alginate producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they have this very
slimy appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because alginate is very
hydrophilic or hydroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to hold a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alginate also has many uses commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in food products like this ice
cream and salad dressing or in medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: like the antacid or these special bandages
that are coated with alginate to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: them from sticking to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that the alginate that's used
in these applications isn't isolated from
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, but it comes from algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's chemically the same thing that
bacteria produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little video I want to show here
about a use for alginate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's making watermelon juice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important that he's using calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that property of alginate to bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get this thing moving
forward again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That property of alginate to bind calcium
is important in plant interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a bacterium enters into the
apoplastic space, if it's a non-adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen or just some sort of
environmental bacteria that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to suppress the plant immune
response, the plant cell can recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: epitopes in the flagella and stimulate a
signal transduction pathway that activates
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression, leading to the production
of the immune response, the PTI,
[SPEAKER_00]: or pattern-triggered immunity,
generating ROS, the reactive oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: species, antimicrobials, nutrient
limitation, or in formation of callos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the production of alginate binds
calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, I missed a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, part of the process is the influx
of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps potentiate the immune
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turns out, alginate is also other
exopolysaccharides produced by other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, like xanthan gum and amylovin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bind up to calcium, and they prevent it
from being able to pour into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps to dampen the immune
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, there's been many different
approaches looking at whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: alginate was important in plant disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out it's sort of variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, yes, alginate is important,
and sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just depends on the path of VAR
producing alginate in the host plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: it interacts with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make things more confusing,
sometimes it's not clear whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the production of alginate that's
important, or if it's the regulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: algae, that's having the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set out to test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this experiment, we inoculated tomatoes
with a list of tomato leaves with either
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type Pseudomonas syringae pathovar
tomato DC 3000, or mutants of it that are
[SPEAKER_00]: unable to produce alginate or have the
algae sigma factor deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, it's a little difficult
to see here, but there's no difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between wild-type and the alginate minus
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this indicates that for DC 3000 tomato
interactions, alginate is not important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but algae production is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regulatory effects of algae are
important for the formation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a corresponding decrease in
the growth of the bacteria while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that algae is important
for regulating genes that are important
[SPEAKER_00]: for virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's true, then one prediction is
that if we overexpress algae, that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should see an increase in virulent
symptoms, even in strains that are unable
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce alginate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we've infected with a DC 3000
mutant that does not produce alginate,
[SPEAKER_00]: has algae deleted, and then we've provided
algae in trans from an overexpression
[SPEAKER_00]: vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that there's a dramatic
increase in symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fully complements the growth of the
bacteria in a plant, but the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't exceed that of the wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's interesting because it
shows us that the virulence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria has increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability of each cell to damage the
plant tissue is increased by the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of, by algae's function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that algae is controlling
sets of genes that are important for
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set up an experiment to figure out
what those genes might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used RNAseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RNAseq is a method that allows you to
survey the transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use this to evaluate the
transcriptome in bacteria growing under
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions or different mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our case, we compared the
transcriptome in bacteria that are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing algae to cells that were
deficient in algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We determined the entire transcriptome by
comparing by Illumina sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we compared the amounts of each
transcript for every gene under these two
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the data looks like
mapped out onto the DC 3000 genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the part of the genome
that encodes the alginate biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that when algae was
expressed, you see high-level expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of this operon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is little or no expression
in the empty vector control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that in total, 965 genes were
regulated by this sigma factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority were upregulated,
which you would expect for a sigma factor
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are transcription activators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were also some downregulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are most likely indirectly
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to look at some of the
functions of these 965 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through each one,
but I'll try to summarize the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: themes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we did was compare the
algae-regulated genes in this bacterium to
[SPEAKER_00]: others, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another path of R where the
algae regulon has been determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by comparing, we could see what was in
common in these strains, identify the core
[SPEAKER_00]: regulon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were genes that were involved with
stress responses, osmotic stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive oxygen stress, and also alginate
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consider these to be the core
functions of algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at the downregulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to our surprise, we found that there
was a large amount of chemotaxis and
[SPEAKER_00]: motility genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, one of the most strongly
downregulated genes was this gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly C is the gene that encodes flagellin,
which is the main structural component of
[SPEAKER_00]: flagella, and also contains important
activators or epitopes for PTI
[SPEAKER_00]: elicitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, in the regulon, there were 115
different functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We analyzed to see if any of the
functional groups were enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, one was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was genes for pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked more closely at this,
compared the algae, the genes in the algae
[SPEAKER_00]: regulon, to that of the harp L regulon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said earlier, harp L is the sigma
factor for regulation of the type III
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion system in the secreted
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And algae regulates about 30% of the harp
L genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These include regulators like harp L,
harp V, sig X, also elements of the type
[SPEAKER_00]: III secretion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like harp C and harp Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also important effectors,
AVR-PTOB and AVR-PTO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together, these data suggest that algae
is an important regulator for coordinating
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression of multiple systems that
are important for virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alginate production, resistance to
oxidative and osmotic stress, the type III
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion system, and then downregulation
of flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at how algae was doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to understand the mechanistic
basis of algae's interaction with the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: that it regulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because it will allow us
to make predictions about genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by algae and other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will also give us a basis for
assigning genes as being directly
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sigma factors like algae make protein
DNA contacts in the promoters,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are upstream of the genes that they
regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do so by making contact with
these conserved boxes or motifs located at
[SPEAKER_00]: these distances upstream of the
transcription start site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each promoter that a particular sigma
factor regulates will have conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences in these locations because the
protein is basically binding the same
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides in each instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use that idea to figure out what
the important nucleotides are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we do that is by identifying
many examples of promoters regulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the sigma factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we align them using computational
methods to produce a motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can test the motif and then
use the motif for predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we do this is using the
technique of ChIP-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: ChIP-seq is a high throughput way of
mapping the location of DNA binding
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins on the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for algae, we would express algae in
the bacteria, fragment the DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: or cross-link the protein DNA complexes,
fragment the DNA, purify the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this by a flag tag that we clone
into the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we degrade the protein and sequence
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the sequence DNA is mapped onto the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that in locations where
the protein was bound, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment for sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what actual data looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a ChIP-seq peak in the algae flag
IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the no flag tag, negative control,
there's no enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can layer this onto transcriptional
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see at the location where there
is a highly expressed algae-dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, there's algae binding directly
upstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, we found 204 ChIP-seq peaks
across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: 97 were associated with algae-dependent
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then identified this motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alignment of the 204 sites allowed us
to produce this motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hypothesis is that the height of
the letter corresponds to its role and
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested that by scanning through and
making mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we see, that basically the
higher the letter, the greater the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleotide has on expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we knew something about what algae
was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what we want to know is what is
the relevance of this sigma factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the sigma factor doing to promote
the bacterial, the ability of the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin, we focused on flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flagella, if you can see this,
are these long tail-like structures that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming from one pole of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're attached at one of the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their function is in bacterial
motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rotate and it can propel the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because it allows the
bacteria to move towards things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: good for growth, like nutrients,
in a way from stressors that will
[SPEAKER_00]: interfere with growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're important for the bacteria
being able to colonize plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria that are non-modal are less
able to colonize plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, they're also a
liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after the bacteria enters into the
plant, then they can be detected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant surveillance systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is how does algae down-regulate?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question because algae is a
transcription activator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to sort out how it's doing its
job in down-regulating flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is, does algae-dependent
down-regulation of flagella influence the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant association?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this sigma factor important for helping
the bacteria avoid stimulating PTI?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from our RNA-seq experiments,
we knew that algae down-regulates the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the fly C gene and other
flagellar genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing for us to do is to test
whether or not this down-regulation in
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression corresponded to a change
in the bacteria's behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overexpression of algae drastically
reduces the bacterial motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look in the literature,
you'll see models of algae-dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulation of flagella going through
a protein encoded by this AMRZ gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: AMRZ is the alginate and motility
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algae up-regulates this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its product down-regulates flea Q,
which is the master regulator of flagellar
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we tested that in syringae by
overexpressing AMRZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we see the opposite result,
that overexpression of AMRZ makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria more motile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model is unlikely to apply in
syringae and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this result confirms a study
that's already been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an unpublished preprint that's
available on the internet that shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: this also happens in Pseudomonas satseri.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We began by looking at the genes that
algae regulated, trying to find anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be involved with the regulation
of flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't get very far, because
immediately we found flea Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flea Q is not itself regulated by algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found was this interesting
antisense expression within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be an algae-dependent
transcript expressed opposite to the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of the flea Q gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the location of algae
binding in the ChIP-seq, there's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: respectable algae ChIP-seq peak right
upstream of this transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you may know, there's an emerging
field that shows that antisense
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts are important gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can do so in a number of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can control the rate of
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can affect the stability of RNA
transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can control the rate of
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can either increase or decrease
whether or not a transcript is translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to examine the function of
this antisense RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we demonstrated that it is
expressed, and it's algae-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using another method, we also mapped the
location of the transcription start site
[SPEAKER_00]: and figured out how long these transcripts
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, is this transcript
functional or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tricky question, because
generally what we do in molecular genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: is just delete the gene, show that we have
a phenotype, and then restore it,
[SPEAKER_00]: complement it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we couldn't do that in this case,
because eliminating this gene would also
[SPEAKER_00]: delete parts of the gene that were
transcribed on the other strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to deal with that, we used our
knowledge of the algae-regulated promoters
[SPEAKER_00]: to make mutations that eliminated
expression of the antisense, but
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained the reading frame and the
coding sequence on the opposite strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to do was to locate the
five prime end of the antisense transcript
[SPEAKER_00]: and then look upstream to see if there was
a match to the promoter, and indeed there
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we identified mutations that
disrupted the function, but maintained the
[SPEAKER_00]: coding sequence of the FLEQ gene,
and we demonstrated that by these
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations we can eliminate the expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We installed a mutation into the genome
and showed that it eliminated expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to test the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have strains that have the wild-type
promoter, where the FLEQ antisensory
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript should be expressed in
algae-minus cells, algae-plus cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the mutant algae-minus and plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's algae-dependent,
so there's no effect when the algae is not
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was that when the
transcript is present, it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonized or worked in opposition to
FLEQ, or algae's role in down-regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when cells have the antisense
transcript, they're more modal than they
[SPEAKER_00]: would be when they don't have the
transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at whether or not the transcript
was changing the expression of genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: either in the algae regulon or part of the
flagellar biosynthesis pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't change algae expression or
expression of the alginate biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it doesn't change the FLEQ transcript
expression or stability, and presumably it
[SPEAKER_00]: does not affect the rate of translation
because genes that are dependent on FLEQ
[SPEAKER_00]: are unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know exactly what it's doing
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked at its conservation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we knew exactly where its
promoter was, we were able to look in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes of all sequence pseudomonads,
and what we see is that it's very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in about half of the pseudomonads,
you can see that this yellow, red,
[SPEAKER_00]: and green these green bars match to the
negative 35 region, and the blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow, and basically it's these down have
it, and the ones on the top do not have
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us that this sequence is
under selection, and it's important for
[SPEAKER_00]: these bacteria to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't exactly know how it's
functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we didn't find out what we
were looking for, which is how does algae
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulate flagellar expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking a number of other
approaches, including a mutant hunt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also looking at regulation by algae of
elements of the flagellar biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic gene network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so far I've told you that algae
down-regulates motility genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can affect the behavior by making the
bacteria less modal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work from other labs, there's good
evidence that shows that algae is active
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants and that alginate is produced in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests the hypothesis that algae
has a role in down-regulating flagella
[SPEAKER_00]: while the bacteria are in the plants,
and we wanted to test that and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: whether, detect whether or not this can
help the bacteria avoid stimulating PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took advantage of a couple of
aspects of the PTI to test this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when bacteria infiltrate the epiplast,
epitopes in the flagella are detected,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can stimulate PTI generating ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at ROS response, and we also
looked at another aspect of PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant tissues that have been
pre-stimulated for PTI are resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: type 3 secretion from a secondary
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So type 3 secretion is blocked after the
plant cells have been stimulated for PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you how we use that to probe
whether or not algae was regulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulation of PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, you can inject bacteria
into plant leaves, and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of different types of responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the hypersensitive response,
and this is due to the secretion of
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors that are recognized by receptors
in the plant cell that trigger this
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed cell death, giving you this
macroscopic tissue collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you can easily
visualize very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand is PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stimulating PTI generates these
biochemical responses, but it's not easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to visualize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't see any obvious change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we take advantage of this ability
of PTI-stimulated cells to block the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion from a secondary infection,
then we can see whether or not the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cells have been stimulated for PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we inject one bacteria that
we're testing to tell whether or not it
[SPEAKER_00]: has flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has flagella, then it will stimulate
PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will prevent type 3 secretion from
the secondary infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see protection in this overlapping
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bacteria that you are testing do
not encode flagella, then the tissue will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be protected, and you see the
instigation of the HR in that zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use this to tell whether or not
DC3000 or mutants that don't have algae
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to change the presentation of
flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, wild type is a mutant that
doesn't produce any type 3 secreted
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed to use this mutant because
we wanted the natural function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors is to suppress PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to reveal the PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your initial infection is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we infiltrate with an avirulent
syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces an HR response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the overlapping zone, you see
partial protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissue is partially protected by the
initial infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we delete algae, it's fully protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows you that there is strong
expression of the flagella in the absence
[SPEAKER_00]: of algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's flagella because if we
delete fly C, then the protection is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can complement this with algae
expression in trans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect of the PTI response that
we surveyed was the ROS response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd expect that if the ROS response
is dependent on the presentation of
[SPEAKER_00]: flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more flagella, the greater the ROS
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the wild type level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you eliminate fly C, it drops it down
to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You eliminate algae, ROS level goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You eliminate fly C, it eliminates the
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's complemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is consistent with a role for
algae in down regulating flagella and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping the bacteria avoid activating the
PTI response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this acts kind of redundantly with the
type 3 secretion effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine that this might be
important in a situation where the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are entering into a plant,
where the plant is partially resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the beginning of a pathogen just
beginning its association with a new host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, I told you that algae
controls many genetic systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: including flagella expression and
motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algae-dependent down regulation of
flagella is complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we haven't figured it out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So algae-dependent down regulation of
flagella also contributes to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions by helping the bacteria avoid
stimulating plant immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to everybody that's helped with
this work, everybody's contributions are
[SPEAKER_00]: essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of it could have been done
without everybody's help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a dynamic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are times where the bacteria need
flagella to move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once the bacteria has entered
into the aquaplast, now flagella are a
[SPEAKER_00]: liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what they want to do, it's optimal
if the bacteria can reduce the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that the way that they do it
is by activating algae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brian, in this situation, I can see why
shedding flagella is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be selective pressure to have
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of plants that don't
detect flagella.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of type 3 effectors that
kind of intercept that recognition effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you see the kind of grand
selection forces that are maintaining this
[SPEAKER_02]: environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this system, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not in all systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Brian, do you have any insight on how
some of the mechanisms you've been looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true that flagellar expression is
beneficial to epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps them get to locations on the
plant leaf where they can get nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe avoid radiation, get to cooler parts
of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not sure that anybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can look at B728A for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other pathovars that are better
epiphytes than the one we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at those organisms and see
whether or not there's differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: their strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true with regard to algae's
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plant, that it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are situations where having
alginate production helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.
[SPEAKER_04]: In what part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much we don't know about how
transcription works at the genome level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's infinitely complex, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all types of, every variation of
regulation you can imagine exists out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine that this one anti-sense that
we looked at is probably one of many that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all working to finally tune the system
so that they perform exactly how it
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Epidermal cells, no.
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to do with whether or not they have
the receptors on the surface of the cell.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
