[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Michael, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for coming to the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to introduce a little bit
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Southern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here Portugal, France.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are working here in La Rioja
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the smallest region in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are only 320,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the grape and wine industry in Spain
is economically very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 60,000 hectares of vineyards,
which is about 150,000 acres, which
[SPEAKER_00]: represents the 6% of the grape area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Spain, we have over 1 million
hectares of vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in La Rioja, we produce the 40%
of the quality wines of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Institute of Grapevine and Wine
Sciences is in the middle of these
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixed institute formed by three
institutions, the government of La Rioja,
[SPEAKER_00]: the University of La Rioja, and the
Spanish National Research Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 90 hectares for experimental
and institutional purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 80 researchers in the
institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can accommodate up to 300
researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking for students,
postdocs, and researchers for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: sabbaticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the institute opened in May 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the scientific building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also a nice conference room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an underground winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see the winery, a new winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't sell wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make wine for social events,
meetings, institutional events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also an experimental winery where
we make micro-vanification, greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and laboratories with nice view of a lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the research areas, we have two
departments, the Department of Beauty
[SPEAKER_00]: Culture and Department of Phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my research group is called
Interactions of Grapevine with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like Department of Crop
Protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to apply integrated
management strategies against pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases of grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, grapevine-drank diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, we work also on powdery mildew
and Eotetranicus carpinii in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two objectives are more for
extension rather than research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grapevine-drank diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the worldwide annual financial cost of
the replacement of death plants due to
[SPEAKER_00]: GTDs, grapevine-drank diseases,
is estimated to be over $1,500 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by just taking into account 1% of death
of death plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a look at Europe,
in Europe, in Spain, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have from 3% to 20% of unproductive
vineyards, 12% in France, 5% in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3% to 30% in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this phenomenon is widespread in many
countries in the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have data from California here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the economic impact accounts for 14% of
the gross producer value, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated to be more or less a net loss of
more than $200 million per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes evident that fungal-drank
diseases are among the most destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases of grapevine in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In France, so the director of the French
Vine Institute considered this phenomenon
[SPEAKER_00]: a national crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are responsible for 12% of the
French vineyards area being
[SPEAKER_00]: non-productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this represents nearly 250,000 acres of
vineyards given an estimated loss of 1
[SPEAKER_00]: billion euro, which is a high amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the prestigious English newspaper,
Financial Times, this journalist wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: this article in 2013 after her trip to
France.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grapevine declined, and she
highlighted the rise in the incidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: vine food diseases in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she put this funny photo of a plant in
the hospital with a doctor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis not very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are fungal-drank diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are caused by fungal pathogens
that produce a slow or rapid decline of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vines as a result of vascular
colonization and canker formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have a look at the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see these nice reports from French and
Italian researchers back to the early 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: century with some photos, some symptoms,
vascular streaking, foliar symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: white rot, I mean fungal-drank pathogens
more than 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why this increase in the incidence of this
pathosystem now over the last 25 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emergence of grapevine-drank
diseases is considered to be caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: several factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one can be the changes in
cultural practices and vineyard management
[SPEAKER_00]: for increasing grape yield, I mean the
intensification of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one, the reduced phyto-sanitary
quality of grapevine propagation material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, during the 90s, there was a high
demand of propagation material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also there was a lack of supply of
first quality planting material by
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, by nursery, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some nurseries sold second and third
quality planting material, infected
[SPEAKER_00]: planting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third reason, reductions in the
availability of efficient fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the sodium arsenide,
which was prohibited in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fungicide was very effective,
not only to eliminate pathogenic strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also all the microflora in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it produced cancer, so it was banned
from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, less protection of
pruning boots due to the increasing cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will talk later about the pruning
boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this created a new scenario,
a new complex situation So since then,
[SPEAKER_00]: many publications all around the world
about grapevine-drank diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening in the world of
grapevine-drank diseases, the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal tract pathogens in grapevine
nurseries, even some people comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevine-drank diseases with the
phylloxera of the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of the need for a closer
coordination between scientists was
[SPEAKER_00]: conceived, and the International Council
of Grapevine-Drank Diseases was realized
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, researchers from all over
the world meet to exchange information
[SPEAKER_00]: about different topics related to GTDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in Europe, we have the cost action,
sustainable control of grapevine-drank
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are about 18 countries, and we work in
different working packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exchange information about pathogen
characterization, epidemiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial ecology, host pathogen
interactions, and disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm talking all the time in plural,
grapevine-drank diseases, how many
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases we have on grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can distinguish diseases in young
vines, less than seven, eight years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: or mature vines, more than seven,
eight years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in young vines, we have Blackfoot
disease, Petri disease, and Botryferia
[SPEAKER_00]: adiabac, which also affects mature vines,
along with ESCA and Utipa adiabac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for you, in this state,
you have also Fomopsis adiabac that is
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by different species within the
genus Diaporte.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about each of the
diseases and a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidemiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Blackfoot and Petri diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the field symptoms are frequently
indistinguishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here a long list of
different kinds of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants don't grow well after
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the stunted growth, retarded
sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we see these leaf necrosis
wilting diabac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these symptoms are more severe each
year, especially under stress conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: overcropping, drought, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi responsible of Blackfoot disease
usually affect the base of the rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that are not familiar with
grapevine, this is the rootstock,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here the graft union and the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here a list of symptoms,
reduction of root biomass, root hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: irregular root distribution, and sometimes
these J rooting rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: J rooting rootstocks affected by Blackfoot
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the epidemiology, these are soil
borer pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce chlamydospores for them,
allow them to survive for long periods of
[SPEAKER_00]: time in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They infect the plant through the roots,
but they can also infect the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: material during the propagation process in
grapevine nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding Petri disease, this fungi
associated with this disease colonize the
[SPEAKER_00]: silent vessels, producing this brown to
black base color streaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see these black spots, sometimes
like rings surrounding the pith,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the result of pylosis,
gums, and phenolic compounds produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the host in response to fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the epidemiology, they can also
live in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the disease cycle, they can
spend part of the disease cycle in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can penetrate through the plant,
in the plant through the pruning wounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can also infect planting
material, as in the case of Blackfoot
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next disease is Botrypheria diabac.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungi responsible of this disease
affect spores, cordons, and trunks,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the death of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see in these photos these
symptoms, so a lack of spring growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: one or more spore positions, and the
normal healthy one, healthy growth in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the former name of this disease was
Black Death Arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cross sections, we see these cankers,
perennial weight cankers, and the death of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vine part occurs when the remaining
tissue is killed by the growth of this
[SPEAKER_00]: canker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to epidemiology, these
pathogens mainly infect the plant through
[SPEAKER_00]: the pruning wounds, but they can also
infect planting material in nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the diagram, in mature
vines, I already talked about Botrypheria
[SPEAKER_00]: diabac.
[SPEAKER_00]: ESCA disease, and you type a diabac,
ESCA disease is the most famous disease in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mild form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see symptoms in berries, also foliar
symptoms, the berries dry up, or rot
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvesting, and in symptoms,
the typical tiger stripe pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as Gravine Leaf Stripe Disease
Syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this discoloration surrounded
by this red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are red cultivars and white
cultivars, the same symptoms, but the red
[SPEAKER_00]: color is absent in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these symptoms are very discontinuous,
I mean, very erratic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get symptoms one year, but the
plant can recover easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: From these symptoms, but we have also the
acute form, the apoplexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like an overall death appearance
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears quickly and dramatically,
especially during spring and summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant needs water, the vascular
system is blocked, and the plant gets
[SPEAKER_00]: collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sample of the apoplexy, apoplectic form
of ESCA disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in internal boot symptoms, we can see
these black spots, similar to those seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in petri disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boot gets this pink-red color,
and the older boot is more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: the attack of basidomyces, so
lignin-degrading pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here some internal boot
symptoms of basidomyces, this spongy boot,
[SPEAKER_00]: soft boot, white rot, typical of lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: lignin-degraded pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a look at the disease cycle of
phyacrimonium minimum, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most common causal agents of petri disease
and the ESCA, if we have infected boot,
[SPEAKER_00]: from this infected boot, this pathogen can
produce overwearing structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: peritifia, sexual structures, or asexual
structures, connected force with conidia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pores, both ascospores or conidia,
are spread by arthropods, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind, or pruning shears, bringing water
and wind, the most common ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pathogens infect the pruning wounds,
colonize the silent vessels, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: boot is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition, this inoculum can be
incorporated into the soil by infected
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inoculum in the soil can eventually
colonize roots or the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rootstock, colonize the silent vessels,
and then we have the boot infected again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this occurs in young plants,
it's petri disease, and this occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: mature plants, it's called ESCA disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a relationship, a link,
in between both diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last disease, eutypadiabac,
we can see symptoms in shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, stunted growth, chlorotic leaves,
sometimes cooked with necrotic margins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and internal boot symptoms are the same,
are very similar to those observed in
[SPEAKER_00]: botrysphorediabac.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cankers, perennial cankers or
wage-shaped cankers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impossible to distinguish among
both diseases just looking at internal
[SPEAKER_00]: boot symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the epidemiology, these
pathogens can infect the plant through the
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, we have pathogens that
infect the plant through the pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: wounds, other soilbore pathogens or
pathogens that can expand part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease cycle in soil and can infect the
plant through the rootstock, the crown of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rootstock or the roots, and other
pathogens such as phyracademonium species
[SPEAKER_00]: or pheomonia laclamidospora that can
infect the planting material during the
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation process in nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So complex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here an example of a plant
affected by GTDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cut this plant, we see some
different symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We isolate phyracademonium minimum from
black spots from Etypodia mediterranea
[SPEAKER_00]: abasidio maizit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causing white rot and diplodia seriata
associated with this sectorial necrosis
[SPEAKER_00]: like cankers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no relationship between
external symptoms and associated pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: and simultaneous infections by different
pathogens from different diseases are very
[SPEAKER_00]: common in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the situation we had in Spain in
1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two diseases and three pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have five diseases and more than 50
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is thought that there are more than
130 fungal species associated with GTDs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highlighted in red, the most common,
but they are not the most pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in B.
[SPEAKER_00]: diaba group, the species of neophysicocum
genus are much more aggressive than,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, diplodia seriata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pathogenic status of most of these
species has not been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably more than 50% or 70% of the
pathogens have been demonstrated to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important data is that we are able
to isolate these pathogens from
[SPEAKER_00]: asymptomatic planting materials,
so plants with no symptoms of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the propagation process of grafted
plants, which is similar in all parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cuttings, rootstock, and scion
cuttings are collected from mother fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are introduced in a nursery
preparation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several steps, hydration,
cold storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rootstock and the scion is grafted in
these omega grafting machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then grafted plants are put in these
rooms, special rooms with high temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity, to form the chaos and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these grafted plants are placed in
fields for five to six months until they
[SPEAKER_00]: are uprooted, pruned, distributed,
and sold to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they can be put in pots and
distributed the same season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during this propagation process,
there are many opportunities for fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nursery grower make a lot of cuts and
wounds that are susceptible for fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this experiment, we took samples from
mother plants, rootstock mother plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rooted vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the classical isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a culture medium, then we took water
from hydration tanks, washings from
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors, and omega grafting machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also took peat during the causing
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these HLAs were analyzed by microscopy,
molecular biology, and also the liquids,
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR, and filtering and culturing in a
semi-selective culture medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results we obtained is that all the
stages of the propagation process are
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially inoculant sources for these
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got pathogens in all the stages of the
propagation process, mainly from Petri and
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackfoot diseases, and Boitreferiodeabac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we control, apply management
strategies against these diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, it's very important to establish
new, healthy plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a method, the hot water
treatment, which is very effective against
[SPEAKER_00]: many diseases and pests, such as
nematodes, millibugs, and even the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial cellulophus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We show that many stages of the
propagation process can be infected by
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we recommend the general standards of
nursery hygiene, so cleaning of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipments, nursery spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recommend an integrated management
program, including as many strategies as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk in this presentation
about hot water treatment, the current
[SPEAKER_00]: situation of chemical control,
disease resistance, and biological
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hot water treatment is a simple
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this experiment, I'm going to talk a
little bit about the results of this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the planting material first is hydrated
in these water tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we treat the plants, different
treatments, temperatures, and time
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put these plants in a cool
down tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use this planting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This planting material was planted in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the growing season,
we collected the planting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured the shoot weight and also the
sprouting, just to check for the viability
[SPEAKER_00]: of this planting material after hot water
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results, I'm going to show only the
results of the sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have many graphs and data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, there were no significant
differences among treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at 54 degrees, a high temperature,
we see some detrimental effect of hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water treatment with respect to the
control and the other treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second experiment, we inoculate
directly, so conidia, into the silent
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels using this vacuum pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conidia of two pathogens, pheomonella
clamidospora and phagremonium minimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: two of the most common petri-disease
pathogens in grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these inoculated cuttings were
treated with hot water treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted these cuttings inoculated
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the growing season,
we collect again these cuttings just to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if the pathogens survived or not the
hot water treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that for pheomonella
clamidospora, there was a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the recovery of the pathogen
from 51 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of phagremonium,
the treatment worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some colonies at 51 or 54 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion, hot water treatment is
an effective method, can reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly the infection of
transdisease pathogens without causing
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental effects of grapevine planting
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fixed 53 degrees for 30 minutes as
an effective method to control these
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nurseries now have a method to use
as a protocol to disinfect planting
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't they use hot water treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years ago, we did a European
nursery survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sent a questionnaire to more than
600 nurseries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 130 positive replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked a question, why don't you use
hot water treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they questioned the reliability and
efficacy of these treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that it's an effective
treatment for eliminating GTDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not really true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logistics involved in these treatments
are too difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a grower needs for example,
one million plants from one day to another
[SPEAKER_00]: day is impossible to treat this amount of
plants in this water tank just in 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought that there is a lack of
studies in commercial batches about this
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many studies on grapevine and
other booty crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the chemical control,
the situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Europe, in Spain, we demonstrated
that carbon design was effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Petri disease just incorporated
into hydration tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some colleagues in Portugal
demonstrated that these active ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: were effective against Blackfoot disease
and Botifaria diavac.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the situation, not only in Europe,
but all over the world, is a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lack of active ingredients are available
to control these diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, we have only in Germany,
Kinosol, which we demonstrated in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study that it doesn't work against Petri
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have fungicides available to
control this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget about fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatives, whole resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this experiment, we inoculated the most
common grapevine roostocks in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we treated with whole water
treatment to eliminate fungal infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we inoculate these grapevine cuttings
with Petri disease pathogens, different
[SPEAKER_00]: Petri disease pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we inoculated 6,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured its protein, shoot weight,
and disease severity according to this
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, showing the percentage of necrotic
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: These inoculated cuttings were planted in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the growing season,
we measured that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, the results show that most of
the roostocks were susceptible to fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clear example of quantitative
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found these roostocks, 161,
49 cc.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't find significant differences
among treatments when measuring this
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, the shoot weight, and the disease
severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this roostock could be a good candidate
to integrate in our management programs
[SPEAKER_00]: against GTDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the biological control,
I'm going to highlight this study made by
[SPEAKER_00]: Italian researchers last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they evaluated the natural infections
by using trichoderma atrobiridae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used Kainosol, water, or trichoderma
atrobiridae at different stages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that there was a highly
reduction of the natural infection by
[SPEAKER_00]: using trichoderma at these stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they inoculated cuttings with
pheomoniae laclamidospora and pheomonia
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat trichoderma separately at
different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they made the isolation at the
end of their nursery process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They observed the conclusion was that
applying trichoderma at the stages one and
[SPEAKER_00]: two, so hydration, so significantly
reduced the artificial infection by these
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the colonization of trichoderma at
these two stages was higher than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trichoderma could be an option under
control conditions, under nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a clear example of an integrated
management program against GTDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a work and a study done by South
African researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used different chemicals,
trichoderma, hot water treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a combination of different strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combination of different products at
different steps of the propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conclusion was that this
integrated strategy, so using veromil
[SPEAKER_00]: before cold storage, hot water treatment
before grafting, sport kill, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium, and treat trichoderma to
different stages, was the most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most effective strategy to reduce
significantly fungal infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion here is that we have to
take care of the plant, the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: material, in each step of the propagation
process if we want to provide the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: at least to minimize fungal infection in
this planting material for graving
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about immature vineyards?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw in the recycles that pruning
wound should be protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have chemicals available to
protect pruning wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's difficult to find a product or
different products that can be effective
[SPEAKER_00]: against ascomycetes, basidomycetes,
choleomycetes, so many taxonomically
[SPEAKER_00]: unrelated pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the difficulties and costs associated
with hand application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the biological control?
[SPEAKER_00]: To use in field conditions, there is lower
availability of commercial products,
[SPEAKER_00]: some trichoderma strains, there are some
bacillus strains in the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not experimentally approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to consider irregular
efficacy rates of the biological control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the strain of the
biocontrol agent, the cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental conditions, many
different factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another problem of pruning wound
protection is the susceptibility of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are susceptible of up to four
months after pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the problem of spraying some
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many applications do we have
to do just to get a good control of GTDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a root stock model plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the number of wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impossible to cover with a
fungicide or a mastic barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This amount of pruning wounds,
which are an open door for fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here the problem in the field,
so the cost of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to know how to prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drilling number of skillful
laborers and the most important thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the prolonged susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be susceptible of up to four
months, the pruning wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strategy would be to remove the
pruning debris or remove the death plant
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we saw in the disease cycle that
these pathogens can produce fruit and
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies in these death part plants,
in cracks, cordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be nice to remove this plant
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last option would be the trunk
renewal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to cut the affected boot
until getting to healthy boot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then cover this wound with a barrier,
a mastic, what is available at the moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then drain this water shoot up to the
vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, these practices are cost
effective, but the complete efficacy is
[SPEAKER_00]: not guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in eschatesis vines,
it's not possible to apply this strategy
[SPEAKER_00]: because we get vascular colonization or
root rot even in the root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impossible to use this strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can also just prune in periods with
lower infection risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do sport trapping studies to see when
the inoculum level is maximum in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this table, we can see the
sport availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the northern hemisphere,
we have some example of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually prune in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: In gray background, we can see the
availability of sports in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And H means the height inoculum level
according to the sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sport trapping studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we prune in January, we have an open
door of four months, with the inoculum
[SPEAKER_00]: level is maximum in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really difficult to establish a
precise date of pruning wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to finalize this presentation
just talking about our current research
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and the future prospects for disease
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are busy with the biology of
Blackfoot disease pathogens and the
[SPEAKER_00]: control trying to identify the
root-resistant planting material in their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the epidemiology, we suspect
that this stage of the propagation process
[SPEAKER_00]: is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plants, grafted plants,
spend here four, five, six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are soluble pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw in my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can infect planting material here
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the crop rotation system used
for grapevine nurseries in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plant grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they leave the land in fallow,
bare land.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plant wheat, then barley,
and then grapevine again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are able to isolate Blackfoot
pathogens from grapevine roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about weeds or soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this experiment, we collected
different weeds, asymptomatic weeds with
[SPEAKER_00]: no symptoms of any disease from different
vineyards and different regions in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we isolated dactylonectatorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most common pathogen associated
with Blackfoot disease in 17 out of 32
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we inoculated these isolates into
grapevine seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we demonstrated the pathogenicity of
these isolates collected from weeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: For soil, we use these grapevine seedlings
as bait plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plant these grapevine seedlings in
different fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we collected, after seven months,
these seedlings and made isolations from
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we collected over 100 Blackfoot
pathogens from these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recently developed a culture medium
specifically for detecting Blackfoot
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested this culture medium in
different soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them tested positive for
dactylonectatorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now isolates from weeds,
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know how to detect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about weeds or barley?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective of our research is to
investigate the role of secondary hosts in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pediatrics of Blackfoot and also to
characterize the diversity and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of Blackfoot pathogens from
grapevine, weed, and rotational crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the second objective of our
research, we are now interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: development in the development of rapid
and reliable screening methods to detect,
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify sources of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collaborate with this GERPLUS
collection in Madrid in Spain,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the second largest GERPLUS
collection in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more than 700 rustocac sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are also busy trying to identify
resistance in commercial varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: minority varieties, and even clones within
the same variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: For testing that, so we inoculate the
grapevine pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make a wound between the two upper
internodes of the cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduce mycelial plaques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cover this wound with cotton,
parafilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we leave the plants in a
greenhouse for six, seven, eight months,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see very quickly the symptoms like
cankers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can discriminate very easily the
most tolerant cultivars or the most
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first year of studies of
tempranillo clones against
[SPEAKER_00]: neophosicocomparmu, which is very
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a great variability among
grapevine clones and even commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can detect the most tolerant and the
most susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these studies are being repeated this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we are able to find more
tolerant planting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the future prospects,
identify different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's important to minimize
infection in planting material,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not an easy task for grapevine
diseases because it doesn't occur as in
[SPEAKER_00]: the case of virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for virus, you can go to a green
tissue, leaves or shoots, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify then the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, so these pathogens
colonize the silent vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have non-destructive methods
to know which pathogen is inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to distract the planting
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we recommend an integrated disease
management program, taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: different steps of the preparation
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the future, the biological
control agents, we have a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide in Europe and all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to search for potential
biocontrol agents by using in deep
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial ecology analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial and mycorrhizae, we need to
study a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to study the mechanism of
action of these biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fewer studies of fungal
population biology made by using GTD
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, only this one with eutypalata
by researchers in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would allow us to assess the
sexual or asexual populations of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens to find founder populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even to find highly pathogenic strains
of each pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: An area which is paying multiple dividends
is the genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some genomes have been sequenced of
different pathogens associated with GTDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would allow us to identify,
to manipulate, to isolate genes
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible of virulence of pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think in the field, it would be
nice just to test more about cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type of pruning, type of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in this study made by
Californian researchers, they concluded
[SPEAKER_00]: that minimal pruning is much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they found less necrosis, good necrosis
compared to sprue pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems obvious because in minimal
pruning, you make less amount of prunes
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the traditional method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the last option would be
breeding for the disease resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think it's really difficult for
grapevines to produce a tolerant or
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant planting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we can get some planting
materials and cultivars more tolerant than
[SPEAKER_00]: the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to thank Michael Milbrom
for hosting my visit to Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University, also a Fulbright program for
funding me, my stay here in Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also my institute to allow me to spend
four months out of office, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: easy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for coming to the seminar and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious, you've had the
opportunity to visit vineyards and assess
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases in different parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you gained any insights from seeing,
looking at differences in disease pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: in say Australia or Zealand or South
Africa versus in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Australia, they don't have
ESCA disease and the incidence of young
[SPEAKER_00]: vine decline is very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very small compared to Europe and
here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have eutypidia vac and butypheria
vac, maybe because I think they pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention of the movement of planting
material in between regions in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably because nurseries do their
work better than us, they use hot water
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably this can be one of the
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just occurred to me in the system
you talked about, it would seem like it
[SPEAKER_02]: might be ideal for exploiting endophytic
organisms that are residing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vascular tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wondered if you or anybody else
looked at sort of the internal flora of
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy and diseased minds and seeing if
there's any kind of promise there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first studies were published a couple
of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a French group at Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are working now on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're studying microflora of rabies,
affected plants, not affected plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also using next generation sequencing
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's now, now it starts right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are going to produce results
probably in the next following years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned a defined availability of
workers to do this, but what's the
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the pruning, the pruning as a
method is like very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know how to prune that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, at least in Europe,
you don't have like special people or
[SPEAKER_00]: people specialized in doing the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the proof also, probably here,
I don't know, in California or here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's one of the main problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to know how to prune the vine,
so to make the pruning work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to know how to
prune the vine, so to make the pruning
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first publication was in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there is any mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's now a topic of great interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are starting working on that
mechanism and the function of trichodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: or the biological control agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in terms of dispersal,
how quickly do these pathogens disperse
[SPEAKER_01]: over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it from vineyard to vineyard,
or is it within vineyards in a season,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's the dispersal?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about alternative hosts,
because the preparation was too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are, this is the problem,
is that they can affect also pruners,
[SPEAKER_00]: olives, and many crops that are planted in
close proximity to vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we suspect that these pathogens can go
to these crops, expand them, back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: busy cycle, produce fruit and bodies,
and then affect also the grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pathogens are spread by propote,
wheat, water, pruners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any collaboration between
industries, then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is the grape industry working with
the olive production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because olives are huge in Europe,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, we have very big problems of the
involvement of industry in projects and
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are lucky here that you have the
industry supporting you in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, in general, it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, let's thank David for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
