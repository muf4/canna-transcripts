[SPEAKER_00]: Caring for your garden really strikes at
the five habits of the heart and it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about those again because people
associate food with their lives and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to care for people's lives because
people's lives are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caring for the lives of a community it's
also embedded in a larger goal of social
[SPEAKER_00]: justice and social change that food
justice efforts seek to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food justice is about actually providing
the foods that are historically culturally
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So food security is just about getting
food to a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just getting nutritious food to a
community, that's really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have food everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go right to the bodega right here on
the corner and get food, but then the
[SPEAKER_00]: question is that the food's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see foods like corn, peas,
squash, like foods you regularly see at
[SPEAKER_00]: the grocery store, it's cool to be able to
grow them and then actually you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to force people to eat foods they don't
want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat foods they already see in the
grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you show them that they can
grow these kind of foods in their
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods or where they're located,
they can still go to the grocery store but
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have to buy all their food from
the grocery store and the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: community gardens is to provide a portion
of food to communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to supply the entire
community foods until it grows more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the small space that there is is an
opportunity to expose people to more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritious foods that they grow
themselves.
Thank you very much.
