[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Vicki Azal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a second year PhD student here at
Cornell studying plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics under Larry Smart with a focus on
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to kick off this webinar
series by saying how excited I am that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the third year that we're hosting
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to thank Cornell Agrotech for
the funding to make this possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also our collaborators at USDA,
the hemp germplasm repository,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly Zachary Stancil, who is
important for founding this webinar
[SPEAKER_02]: series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the past grad students that
ran this, George Stack in the first year
[SPEAKER_02]: and Luis Montserratte last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very excited to pick up the baton
and keep this going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we have a really excellent
lineup of hemp experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you all like really enjoy the
content they have for you because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: they have some interesting talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, feel free as webinars going to
type up your questions, put those in the Q
[SPEAKER_02]: &A box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the speaker is done with his
talk, we'll go through those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other messages, you know, you can do
direct messaging to each other even should
[SPEAKER_02]: go in the chat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, questions in the Q&A box,
everything else in the chat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to welcome our first speaker of
the series, David Suchoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Suchoff is an assistant professor and
alternative crops extension specialist
[SPEAKER_02]: with NC State.
[SPEAKER_02]: His program is focused on collaborative
and applied field-based research in new
[SPEAKER_02]: and emerging crops, particularly as
replacement for tobacco cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: His current crops include a wide variety,
fiber and grain hemp, sesame, organic
[SPEAKER_02]: sunflower, and fiber flax.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also serves as the director of the
Foundation for Food and Agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: Research Hemp Research Consortium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a public-private partnership
that aims to address key industry
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges in the national hemp space
through research and outreach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, David, for being our first
speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, Bahia, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim, as well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an honor to be part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at the lineup of speakers
that you all have planned for this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's quite a tremendous lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm certainly looking forward to
attending and listening to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank everybody else for
attending today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see some familiar names on
the list, even though I can't see your
[SPEAKER_00]: faces yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But additionally, it's nice to see a lot
of new folks, as well as folks from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see someone from France now,
but I saw Zimbabwe and Uruguay and
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a really, really wonderful
webinar.
Thank you so much for being our first
speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for being part of
this webinar series that you all host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Bahia mentioned, my name is David
Suchoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a faculty member here in the
Department of Crop and Soil Sciences at NC
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my position, as mentioned,
is alternative crops extension specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I wanted to do today is to
first kind of discuss what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does my position mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we do what we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to delve a little bit
into North Carolina agriculture and then
[SPEAKER_00]: really spend the majority of our time
talking about fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll admit that the title of the talk
is somewhat misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title is Production Recommendations
for Textile Fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's misleading because we are still
very much learning what those
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the research that we're
doing with fiber hemp is actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the trials that we've initiated
that I'll be talking about today started
[SPEAKER_00]: this past summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of the data that I'll be sharing is
very much preliminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving us a better idea in terms of
how we need to move when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: production recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just know that a lot of this is very
much preliminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking forward to kind of
continuing on with this work and expanding
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go ahead and share my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, can you all see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first talk a little bit about
North Carolina for those of you that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not know much about the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is big in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our number one industry in terms of
economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This past year in 2023, we received just a
little over $100 billion in sales of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different agricultural goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the first time that we broke
$100 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it a large industry,
but it is still a very important and ever
[SPEAKER_00]: growing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting fact about North
Carolina is that our agriculture sector is
[SPEAKER_00]: the third most diverse in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are only behind California and Florida,
which I think is pretty impressive given
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of our state compared to Florida
and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of this has to do with the fact
that even though we're relatively small,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're quite long and we've got a lot of
different geographies ranging from the
[SPEAKER_00]: coast all the way to the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got different soil types,
different climates, different
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimates, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even though this is a very diverse
agricultural system, there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that have been more important
economically speaking than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one in particular is tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know North Carolina in
agriculture, know that tobacco built this
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still is an important crop in our
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, as you all probably guessed,
tobacco acreage is down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumption of tobacco is down globally,
and so acreage is going down with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so unfortunately, what we're seeing is
many of the counties or regions in our
[SPEAKER_00]: state where tobacco has been prominent and
really did build up those communities are
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a lot of economic hardship
and depression and having challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: finding some alternative crop to be either
a full or partial replacement for tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where my position comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My position is a new one in the college
that was developed about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was created specifically to look at
new emerging crops that can fit in a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional tobacco system as either a
full or partial replacement for farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are either already out of tobacco or
are starting to kind of make their way out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess the first question is,
well, what other crops do they grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the majority of tobacco production
occurs in the eastern part of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, basically, these are
traditional row cropping systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning there's corn production,
there's soy production, and there's wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tobacco is fitting in that rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we are looking at alternative
crops, we really want to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that can also fit within these
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that is going to leverage the
same type of equipment or infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: that is shared among these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we are thinking about new
crops, we really need to keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, taken together, when we're talking
about our program, we look at a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bahia had mentioned, we look at hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on hemp since I first
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, when I first started,
most of our work was in cannabinoid or
[SPEAKER_00]: floral hemp because that's where the
industry was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was somewhat of a bubble at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a huge shift towards
fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are moving with that shift as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also work with sunflowers,
as Bahia mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working a lot with sesame,
flax, and a few other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of three core aspects of
our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is agronomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an agronomist by training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the type of work that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to understand, A, if we can even
grow the crop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then B, what is it that we need to do
from a production standpoint to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are producing that crop at the
highest standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also focus on sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really do try to focus on the three
tenets of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is economic viability, environmental
sustainability, and then social equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're looking at these new crops,
we really want to make sure that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at all three of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is this concept of
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that has made tobacco so
special for our state is that we are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce a very specific type of
high-quality tobacco, which is often
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as the Golden Leaf,
the flu-cured Golden Leaf tobacco of North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that's important, and the reason
why I bring that up is that it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that is recognized across the
globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it generates higher profit margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we are looking at these new
and emerging crops, we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are taking that mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I want folks in a different part
of the world to know that, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: sesame from North Carolina or fiber hemp
from North Carolina is of high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: because that means that our farmers can
garner the highest profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're going to talk a little bit
about quality and fiber hemp and the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that we've had in terms of what
that actually means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll get to that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, we saw this big boom
and bust around floral hemp and a big
[SPEAKER_00]: shift towards fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's exciting for North Carolina is
that it's not just farmer interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber hemp, but we're seeing a lot of
interest from processors and end-use
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this brings me to the next
important aspect of our state to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is that textiles is still also a
very important industry in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, admittedly, this industry is not what
it was 20 years ago, 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a tremendous amount of
offshoring of textiles, but it still
[SPEAKER_00]: generates quite a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, close to $1.5 billion in
2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have almost 400 textile manufacturers
in our state, and these range from mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: pop, very small scale, handmade products
to very, very large processors like you
[SPEAKER_00]: see in the photo here and large apparel
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's also really important to note
is that our state produces about 20% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nation's export of textile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the industry is not what it used
to be, but it still is a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very important industry to this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this industry is particularly
interested in fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk to these folks,
whether it is apparel companies that want
[SPEAKER_00]: to integrate fiber hemp into some of their
apparel lines, or if it's nonwoven
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that want to include it into
some of their nonwoven products,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really excited about fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just simply the novelty of
saying, you know, this shirt contains
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, but there are actual benefits to the
garment or to the nonwoven product that
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber from fiber hemp affords them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also really excited about the
sustainability story that's associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can certainly spend some time
talking about that a bit later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go over some basics,
and I apologize because I'm sure there are
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of people on this call that know
this information, but it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: important if you don't know it that you do
because we're going to talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're talking about fiber hemp
production, we're really talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: stem farming, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're after is producing nice,
long, thin stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that's where
the fibers are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fibers are located in the bast in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bast is basically the bark of the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where these very, very long,
very strong cellulosic fibers are located
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can use for clothing or yarn or
nonwoven materials and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the herd, right, which is
that inner woody core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, historically it's been used
for animal bedding, but we're seeing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of really, really interesting innovations
around hempcrete or other applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the herd market in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing much faster than the bast
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about textile
application, it's also important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there are a number of
processes that are required to go from
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting in the field to something that
can then be spun or woven or incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: into, you know, name your garment or name
your nonwoven product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to cut our crop and
we're going to let it ret.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so during that retting process,
we're leaving it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time period, as long as
the environment is correct, microbes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be breaking down the pectin that
binds together the bast and herd,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is critical for our next step,
which is decortication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after it's readied, we take that stem
material out of the field to a
[SPEAKER_00]: decorticator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all a decorticator is is just a set
of, at its most basic, a set of rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: gears that crush the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the stems are properly readied,
the herd will separate from the bast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a pile of herd and we've got
a pile of bast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's decorticated, we then take that
bast to our next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next and final step, which is degumming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And degumming is just pulping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take that bast,
we're going to put it in a big bath that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be water, maybe sodium hydroxide,
maybe hydrogen peroxide, maybe some other
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to add heat and pressure
and we're cooking it so that we can more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less wash away the impurities,
mainly lignin and hemicellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other stuff in there that we're
trying to get rid of so that when we are
[SPEAKER_00]: done with degumming, all we have are those
cellulosic fibers that we can then send to
[SPEAKER_00]: the textile or nonwoven companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really exciting in North
Carolina, to my knowledge, and I may be
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrect in saying this, we are the only
state that has both decortication
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and degumming facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be really critical
when we think about the long-term picture
[SPEAKER_00]: with fibrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are certainly doing a lot of shipping
of materials from state to state,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think when we talk about this crop
really becoming a commodity crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, we're going to have to see
a lot more close processing of these
[SPEAKER_00]: materials because shipping costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is bulky material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a number of degummers,
we've got a number of decorticators,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we also have a number of spinners
and weavers and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I like to see is, yes,
there's interest from farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also there's interest from local
processors that want that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is critical when we think
about looking at a new crop, because if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no demand and there's nowhere to
sell it, why is a farmer going to grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we talk about the research that
we're doing at NC State, at least in my
[SPEAKER_00]: program, as I mentioned, I'm an
agronomist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are looking at trying to address
some of the basic production challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that farmers have to ensure that they can
produce a sustainable fibrin crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a list of some of the
different projects that my program is
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing that I wanted to
highlight is that we're doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting collaborations within
the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working a lot with folks in our
College of Natural Resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking more at the pulping side
of things and the use of herd for paper
[SPEAKER_00]: and packaging and sanitation materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we're also doing a
lot more collaboration with folks in our
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson College of Textiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, of course, are interested in
applications of this material in apparel
[SPEAKER_00]: and nonwoven materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is always a plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever in North Carolina,
you've got to visit the College of
[SPEAKER_00]: Textiles because the work they do there is
just absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are really, really excited about
fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing some very, very cool
things with fiber hemp when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, developing new types of garments
or new ways of spinning and incorporating
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp into more traditional lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do basic agronomic work and we
collect all different types of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, there's two
main pieces of data that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: important for farmers, quantity and
quality, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'm paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many pounds of tomatoes did I produce
per acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the grade of tomato that I
produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's going to dictate how I get
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, measuring quantity is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can measure the amount of dry rotted
straw and then I can decorticate and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the vast yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is we do not yet have
a set of international or even national
[SPEAKER_00]: standards, universal standards,
when it comes to fiber hemp quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not to say that people don't
know what quality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a Nike or a VF or a Patagonia
may have their definition of quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you look at other fiber crops
like cotton, there are USDA standards for
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton and it makes grading cotton very
easy, but it also makes our job as
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers easy too, because we can look
at the different treatments that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying in the field and then relate that
back to quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the absence of these quality
metrics, and I will say as an aside,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are many groups working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just a matter of time before
we get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to think about how we
measure quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to think of quality in two
bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is just the basic fiber morphology,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're to separate that fiber out,
you can measure its length, its diameter
[SPEAKER_00]: or its denier, which is kind of the
diameter of the fiber, its tensile
[SPEAKER_00]: strength, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just basic morphological
properties of the fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can certainly do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we've got equipment that can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another bucket, which is what
I'm calling processability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How easy is it to decorticate,
meaning how easy is it to separate the
[SPEAKER_00]: herd from the bast, how much cellulose is
in there and how much lignin and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemicellulose slash other impurities are
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's going to dictate how much
energy and resources are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: required to de-gum it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is if it requires a lot
more energy to decorticate or a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and inputs to de-gum, you will
quickly overwhelm any of the benefits you
[SPEAKER_00]: see in the fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to affect the strength of the
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may even damage the actual fibers,
cut them, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're doing is trying to focus
on both.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of our work right now is
actually focusing more on processability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we produce stems that are easy to
decorticate and that require the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of chemistries or energy and so on
and so forth to de-gum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not only is that going to reduce
the cost downstream, but that should keep
[SPEAKER_00]: us from damaging those fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can start doing work, whether it's
Larry Smart reading for different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber morphologies or looking at some of
the other agronomic practices to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: those different morphological properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into one of the first
challenges we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first challenge is beautifully
illustrated in this picture I think I used
[SPEAKER_00]: in every one of my talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from 2019 in Hempgrower
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a really nice article about this
interesting interest in fiber hemp in our
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gentleman on the left is Gary Sykes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a hemp farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gentleman on the right is Tamor
Azar, who is a CEO of a hemp decortication
[SPEAKER_00]: company in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're standing in a field of what
should have been fiber hemp that Gary
[SPEAKER_00]: planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with fiber hemp, we're going to
harvest this crop at the onset of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, generally speaking, we're not going
to gain a lot more in terms of stem
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly do see some increase in
growth in certain varieties, even during
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other is that we're going to have
an increase in secondary fiber production
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have an increase of lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes back to processability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be harder to process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to affect that fiber
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that Gary and Tamor are
standing in a field that's maybe three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this crop to be profitable,
we need to be producing at least six,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight foot tall stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: To produce enough biomass for it to be
worth Gary's time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue was that we didn't have
regionally appropriate varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, we were only getting
varieties from countries like France and
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy and Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is critical with a day-long
sensitive crop to understand where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: bred and what the latitude was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to share this map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this map is, is it's lining up
the latitudes with North America and with
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it beautifully illustrates how far
north those countries are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at New York, for example,
OK, I think those French varieties might
[SPEAKER_00]: be a good fit for you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, they're getting a little
bit farther north.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look down at North Carolina,
where we're right around 35 degrees north,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're North Africa in terms of our
latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very, very important because
day lengths differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have here is just a plot of the
average day length for North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_00]: Raleigh, where I am right now,
and Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all are farther north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the middle of the summer when you
have your longest days, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be longer than ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's look at France because a lot
of varieties were coming from France,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically from the Loire Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even farther north than New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at their day lengths,
they're even longer than your day lengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you look at our longest
day in North Carolina, that light blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is roughly the beginning of April,
meaning beginning of the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the beginning of October, beginning of
fall in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's no wonder that when we plant a
French variety in North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to go to flower very,
very early, just like we saw in Gary's
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the first things that we did
was look for varieties from different
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to obtain genetics from
China, specifically Yunnan province.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look there, well,
this is great, even farther south than
[SPEAKER_00]: North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at Kunming right now,
which is about 25 degrees north,
[SPEAKER_00]: so even farther south than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our first year and looking at
them, much better production, much better
[SPEAKER_00]: production, and a much longer season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the individual in this photo,
excuse me, is Alyssa Hawker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alyssa just completed her master's degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of her projects was to look at
these new Chinese generics, at least new
[SPEAKER_00]: to us, in terms of their fit for day
length sensitivity and then biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: production, as well as looking at planting
dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a lot of issues the first year
with seed quality, though our second year
[SPEAKER_00]: we had really, really good seed quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really, really tremendous
producing crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we found that the flowering time
was so late for us, which was usually
[SPEAKER_00]: around the beginning of September,
that we really need to reconsider when we
[SPEAKER_00]: planted the crop, because it just got too
big for really what we would consider
[SPEAKER_00]: textile-grade fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looked like at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does look like bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, once again, as I said,
this is a little bit thicker than what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we would want for textile purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, what the textile
industry says is they want it to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: width of a number two pencil, seven and a
half millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little bit on the thick
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even though these were a good fit for
us in terms of day length sensitivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are still added challenges that
we're now trying to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first is just basic economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm having to ship seed across the
globe from China, there's added cost to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now seed is around $4 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really want to see more domestic
seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are a lot of folks,
including Larry, and I'll talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: in a second, that are doing breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are others, Trey Riddle,
who I think was on early, but I know will
[SPEAKER_00]: be speaking, they've got their own
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having more domestic seeds that
work for us or other parts of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be critical in reducing the
cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another big issue with these Chinese
genetics is that they go hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I have up here are total THC
values that we collected from these
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties in 21 and 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bold numbers are above 0.3%,
that USDA threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that red bold with the
exclamation point is getting really close
[SPEAKER_00]: to that 1% negligent violation,
which is very concerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that it's not every year
that we see those values go hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Larry and his crew have done a
really tremendous job in looking at these
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that they're really a
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within that population, we'll say of
Yuma, Yuma 1, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that still have that gene to
produce THC and some that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when a farmer plants this,
they're kind of playing brush and roulette
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's really no way without
testing it prior to know if it's got that
[SPEAKER_00]: gene or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's also important to note is that
these plants, even though they were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to produce male flowers,
were not really truly flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the material that we were having
tested was vegetative, leaf and stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was still going quite hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know that Larry has been doing
breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are collaborating with Larry in
screening some of his materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down south, and I know he's working with
others, and we're continuing to do variety
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what our variety trial
looked like this past year in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the variety on the bottom left,
that's actually one of Larry's genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which looked really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see not flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variety next to it is one from
Colorado and then two over is another from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it's already starting
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, it really is going to the
background in terms of where they come
[SPEAKER_00]: from, but then also where their bread is
going to be really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final challenge that we have with
these Chinese genetics is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: calling phenotypic plasticity,
or what is known as phenotypic plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is is just basically a
plant's ability to change its phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of the resources that it's
given.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason, we see that in these
Chinese varieties, there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic plasticity than there are in
the Italian varieties or in the French
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give these Chinese varieties a lot
of space, they become trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get really thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a lot of stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's neat to look at, but it's really
of no use from a textiles perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a real challenge to
just harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see that in this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from one of Alyssa's first
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this variety on the left is
Puma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had really poor seed quality,
but you could see there's so much space
[SPEAKER_00]: around that they become these thick trees
with lots of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas on the right, this is Yuma 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better stands, though not great,
but the stems are much thinner and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot less branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we can breed out this phenotypic
plasticity, which that's a job for Larry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to focus more on plant
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we look at just some of the
basic data from Alyssa's study,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that as we increase plant
populations on the x-axis, we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in stem diameter on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the basics of phenotypic
plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this past summer, one of my new
master's students, picture on the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is Sam Carroll, is working on a plant
density study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Sam is doing is she's looking at
different plant stands, ranging from
[SPEAKER_00]: 300,000 plants per acre, which is very
low, all the way up to one and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: million plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how did she do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first we over seeded our plots by
about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came in, we counted every
single plant per plot, and then we thinned
[SPEAKER_00]: them out to get the exact density that we
needed for that specific treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of work, but it's a great
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Sam did is throughout the season,
she was measuring stem diameter and stem
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, she harvested that
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'll just be sharing with you
today are some of the height and width
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in the process of decorticating it
so we can look at bast, and then quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at here is stem
height over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just plotted, no hard
analysis, but they once again show basic
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The black is that 300,000 per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that they're going to be
taller, and they're also going to be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker, and there also is a lot more
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I also want to show is the
distribution of stem diameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things that the textile
industry says that is critical is
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want consistency in product,
and they want consistency when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: stem diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to see how that would
affect the distributions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do our stem diameters look like
within the plots?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just showing the densities
of our diameter over time, so on week
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that bottom yellow is
300,000, the top is 1.5 million,
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at how wide the distribution is
on 300,000, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just getting a very inconsistent
stem diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really trying to focus on
getting a much narrower stem, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also a lot more consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next, what we're looking at is the
height and stem width at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come in, we cut the stems,
and then we measure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing new, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that as we increase plant
populations, our stem height goes down,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to happen, but also that
stem diameter is going to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting close to that magic,
even though I don't think it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: magical, seven and a half millimeters,
around a million seeds per acre,
[SPEAKER_00]: give or take, or I should say pure live
seed per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really interesting is when we
look at thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp and all crops do what is called
self-thinning if you plant enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning they're going to compete with one
another in a plot, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: shade each other out, they're going to
kill each other until they reach an
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the top plot, what we have is
the percent stand thinning, meaning we
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we started with, and then we
know what we ended with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any death that happened during
the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that even in our 300,000,
there's about 30% self-thinning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that as we increase our populations,
we're getting an increase in thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's really interesting is when we
look at our final populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we counted in the beginning,
and then we counted at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that we actually plateau at about
750,000 plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we started with one and a half
million, it all seems to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium around 700 to 750,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is one year of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're obviously going to be continuing
this again, and we're going to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really, really quite interesting
and great work that Sam has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project that Sam is working on,
and this is one that we are doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with IND Hemp, is
understanding harvest timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, in our first harvest
timing, and then at our last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking at two varieties,
Yuma, which is a Chinese variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and IH Williams, which is coming from IND
Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at different harvest
timing, so quite early on when the stems
[SPEAKER_00]: are five feet tall, then at what's called
the GV point, which is when there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: shift in phyllotaxis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp generally is opposites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are opposite one another on the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at a certain point in the life cycle,
generally before blooming, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to shift from opposite to alternate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to basically continue on
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got five feet tall, then the GV
point, then male flowering, which is more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less the traditional timing for
textiles, and then female flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal here is to understand,
yes, what are biomass and bass yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really hone in on quality,
and then understand what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: applications of these fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say a farmer can't get to the
crop until female flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what can we do with that product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not great for apparel,
but maybe it can go into non-globans,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so that we can have other ways for
farmers to get a decent pay for their
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, even if it wouldn't be technically
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also had to do water ready for this
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And poor Sam, as I was putting this
together, we put her through a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has ever water read it,
it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sam is very, very dedicated to the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could certainly talk about water
varying a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed management is another big issue that
we have in the Southeast and in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we did have a herbicide labeled
for use, which is sonilin, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know farmers are going to use it,
but there are also a lot of farmers that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to cultivate, or are already
employing no-till practices, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to go back to tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is work that's being conducted
by my new PhD student, Ashley George,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ashley's got a number of projects that
I'll be talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking about weed
management, it's not uncommon if farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: have a really weedy field in North
Carolina, and didn't get the right
[SPEAKER_00]: planting, they didn't get good crop
emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see what happens on the left,
where we just lose the field to weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that we can get really good
scans and really good canopy closure quite
[SPEAKER_00]: early with many of these fiber hemp
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the picture on the right is roughly
canopy closure, getting close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was only about three and a half
weeks after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very quick growing crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, we did use a herbicide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking for alternative ways
to manage weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so two years ago, we initiated trials
using a no-till system where we plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: a cereal rye mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common system for organic grain
producers, where they grow cereal rye over
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter, they roll it down,
and I'll show this in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they plant into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that that mulch acts as a
weed barrier, but it still allows the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it, and it didn't really work
out well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that the cereal rye
mulch was simply too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could not get good seed placement with
our drill into that mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is when you look
at no-till corn or beans, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: using a drill, generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using a planter with wider row
spacing than we are with fiber hemp at
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and a half inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a planter, you have a lot more
ability to move that material out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you can't do with the drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of stepped back and
reevaluated the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Ashley is doing is she's
looking at a number of other different
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we're looking at cereal rye,
though we are reducing the biomass that's
[SPEAKER_00]: produced through limiting fertility
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at triticale, which is
another grass that doesn't produce quite
[SPEAKER_00]: as much biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're looking at two leguminous
cover crops, hairy vetching crimson
[SPEAKER_00]: clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these two are not used in no-till
traditionally because they've got a high,
[SPEAKER_00]: or excuse me, a lower carbon to nitrogen
ratio so that biomass degrades quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to provide season-long
weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not necessarily a problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I showed, fiber hemp can get
canopy closure around three to four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's off, it's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take care of the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really only need help those first
four weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, she has a bare clean,
so no cover crop that's bare, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to weed it throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bare weedy, where we kept it
clean prior, planted the hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then let the weeds take over as our
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you've never seen the system
before, we come in with a roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we just rolled down and
crimped hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I shouldn't put videos in Zoom,
so I hope this is coming through OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a video of us rolling
down cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always fun to just watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come in with a no-till drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the no-till drill just has these
cultures up front that cut through that
[SPEAKER_00]: residue and open up a little bit of a seed
trench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we place the seed, and then the
closing wheels close it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she was looking at a lot of
different data, obviously looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're after is something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And immediately, I'd like to see the
stands a little bit better, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: still quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fiber hemp coming through a hairy
vetch mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that we're getting
decent stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, you can see some gaps,
but not a single weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hairy vetch is doing a really great
job at reducing weed emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's jump into some of these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've got here are stands at the
beginning of the season, because that was
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue in our first year of trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll admit, the stands are lower than
we wanted in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is very important, what's very
important to note is that when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: our clean control, so that's the black
box, and then our weedy clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is this lightish orange box,
notice that on the whole, statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, except for in Kinston,
they're not different from our no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important, because what
that tells us is that it's not the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that is reducing the stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we look at Kinston, yes,
we do see that crimson clover and rye were
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly lower than our two controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rye is not a huge surprise,
given what we saw the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was a big surprise is what we saw
with hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still scratching our heads as to why
we had such good stands in hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think things just worked out well for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till systems are quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot that goes into getting
it just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're obviously continuing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really, really happy with what
we're seeing overall, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we look at stands at the end of
the season, we don't see any differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only differences that we do see
are in Kinston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, higher stands,
although there is some self-thinning,
[SPEAKER_00]: that stand is lower than what it was at
the beginning of the season, but it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: higher stands than all of the other
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're feeling pretty good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at just the basics
of height and diameter, we see no
[SPEAKER_00]: difference among our treatments,
no differences among height in any of our
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, and no differences in Clinton
or Goldsboro when we look at our diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are these bottom two here,
we do see differences in Kinston.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main differences are really,
once again, coming from hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher stands means thinner stems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already gone over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what's driving those
differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we want to get the stands still a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that Ashley is looking at,
too, is how much biomass is left from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, we're going to cut this,
we're going to leave it in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to bale it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a big concern that we're
going to just pull up all of that rye or
[SPEAKER_00]: pull up all of that vetch when we bale it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing is there is still some
residue from our leguminous cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: though it's much, much lower than what
we're getting from our grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, we're continuing on with
this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to include this cool
picture that Ashley showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left of the dotted line is our
clover plot, no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that actually the clover
went to seed, and so we're getting some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see through the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not great stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is our vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, A, no vetch coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But B, is a dense, dense stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that we saw with clover
is you really have to be careful about
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it before it goes to seed,
because it can become actually a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of talk about green
mulches, but it really does not work with
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hemp was very stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see all of that clover emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot have that for a hemp system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other work that she is looking at,
Ashley, that is nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that this is the biggest limiting
factor when it comes to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ashley is looking at a range of
nitrogen rates from zero all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's also looking at the inclusion of
leguminous cover crops, crimson clover and
[SPEAKER_00]: hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fixing nitrogen over the fall and
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we incorporate that into the
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that we can use all of that
for our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just a fun picture of the
edge effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never seen it, this is a zero
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could see the edge around the plot
where the hemp is basically scavenging for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything it can get, and it looks quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always make sure to harvest within
the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing weekly measurements,
heights and widths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at leaf nitrate,
ammonium, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're looking at these different
metrics at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of running out of time,
so I'm going to go by these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just height data, not that
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, though, and claim we didn't
get great crimson clover standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see that the height wasn't
great in our plots that just received
[SPEAKER_00]: crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a pretty strong nitrogen
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow and then the lighter greens are
lower nitrogen, and then the darker greens
[SPEAKER_00]: are higher nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher the nitrogen, the taller the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see that with our hairy vetch that
it's comparable to about 150 to 100 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen, which is normally what we can
produce with that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our Kingston location, we saw that both
cover crops actually did quite well just
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of height now compared to our
other nitrogen treatments and were
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable to our 200 and 250 pounds of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't think we need 200 and 250
pounds of nitrogen, but it certainly does
[SPEAKER_00]: quite well as just a pure nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for more of that
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other work that Ashley is doing is
looking at redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So redding is both an art and a science in
the sense that we know that there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of factors that affect redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that temperature and moisture and
rain and microbes all affect redding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't really know how to measure
those and give good predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the farmer harvests a crop on
July 1, I want to be able to pull down
[SPEAKER_00]: data that can help them make the decision
when to pull the crop out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Ashley is doing is she's
growing out large acreage of hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then she's putting out these different
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at ambient temperature,
rainfall, leaf moisture, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she's pulling stems out on a
weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she's going to be doing there is
she's going to be decorticating them and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at how easy it is to decorticate,
decorticability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to look at the
chemical makeup of the stems, so pectin,
[SPEAKER_00]: lignin, hemicellulose, excuse me,
so on and so forth, and then look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took pictures throughout this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go from green all the way to this
grayish, and then you get these black
[SPEAKER_00]: splotches on it, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, we're not going to say
all hemp needs to be redded at three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the purpose of this project,
because that's not how redding works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we want to understand the
temporal effects of redding, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what else really drives
redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one aspect that we're looking at is
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, if you look back,
most folks base redding off of color of
[SPEAKER_00]: stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're looking at here are the
stems that she pulled out of the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: their color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a colorimeter, and what that
does is it measures the color of an
[SPEAKER_00]: object, and it converts color to basically
a quantitative value, so numbers that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can then analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the end goal is we're going to be
taking all of these different data,
[SPEAKER_00]: from environmental data to color to
decorticability to all of these other stem
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries, put that into machine
learning algorithms, and understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the key drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then can we use those to predict
redding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of further down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is we know which are,
say, the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we measure those when we harvest and
then use that algorithm to tell us when to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the crop out of the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of a few years down the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a minute late, but I wanted to end
by first introducing and acknowledging
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an amazing team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already seen a lot of the hard work
that they do, but I have an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Shannon Enriquezino.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you could tell,
but Shannon has a little baby bump in this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was working in the field this
summer, even though we told her she should
[SPEAKER_00]: take it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She recently had her baby in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this program is nothing without
Shannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she does a tremendous job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are thrilled for her and her
newborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are so thankful for the hard work
that she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to thank the rest of my
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am happy to take on questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last thing I will do is just give
you all an open invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love having people down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We host field days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to have as many people out
to visit with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to walk through the fields
and look at the different trials we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, we'd be more than happy to host
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, if you want to come visit our
College of Textiles, which I highly,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend, I'd be more than happy
to help coordinate those visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to thank the folks at
Cornell for giving me this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm willing to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you should be able to open the
Q&A box and look at them yourself.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so there are some questions I see
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question about the economic
viability of hemp for grain production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't do a lot of grain
production in North Carolina yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That industry has not evolved in our
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also just don't really,
we've got issues with diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll eventually get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something I can't really
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a question about THC and Chinese
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I answered that one.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron looks like he jumped the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomas, what cultivars would you recommend
for latitudes between 40 and 32 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: south, which correspond to the center of
Argentina?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uma, Yuma, Hane, and 5 or 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tomas, the question about varieties,
that picture that I showed you of Gary
[SPEAKER_00]: Sykes standing in that field from Hemp
Grower magazine, that variety I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: sure was Bialobrasiski, or B-Lab as people
like to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great grain variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some people farther north
through dual market or dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for our environment and our day
lengths, it cannot be used for fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say start off with those
Chinese varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye out for what's being produced
and developed in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's from Larry's program,
but others within the US that are we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a lot more breeding efforts around
fiber for different latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when in doubt, what I always tell
folks that are farming, if you're ever
[SPEAKER_00]: trying anything new, start small and never
invest more than you're willing to lose,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it may not be the right variety or
things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you get some Bialobrasiski,
try a small plot worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, that's it's subjective,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small could be a quarter of an acre to one
person, or it could be 10 acres for
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in terms of day length
sensitivity, those Chinese varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: should do well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But know, too, that even within those,
there's differences when it comes to day
[SPEAKER_00]: length sensitivity in that critical photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, TL asked, are you planning on
evaluating the hemp spectral signature for
[SPEAKER_00]: decortication trials?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're currently doing RGB, and that's
what I showed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to be looking at using
multispectral imaging as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multispec is a little bit challenging
based both on the amount of data you
[SPEAKER_00]: generate, but then also the applicability
of that data and how good those machine
[SPEAKER_00]: learning algorithms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will be looking at that because
it's really, frankly, just a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a picture, quote unquote,
and then having the computing power to
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael asked if the slide presentation
will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make some of the slides available,
but some with the data, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Michael, please reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's specific information that you'd
like, I'd be more than happy to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is hemp susceptible to hop latent virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've seen with our
fiber hemp trials in general is,
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunately, we've not seen a lot of
disease or insect pest damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not to say that we don't see
insect or disease pest damage in hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our cannabinoid or floral hemp,
cornea rooms will devastate a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also types of fungal
pathogens that will devastate a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're not letting this go to
flower, we don't see a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one issue that I have seen in certain
fields is sclerotinia, soil-borne disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: very common in some commodity production
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see it affect fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, we haven't seen it on a
widespread level, but it is something to
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware of, especially if you're going
into fields where you know that you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: a history of that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Michael, you asked a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the fibers be spun on machinery that
you can spin cotton on?
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big challenge that the industry
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I say no is that fiber hemp
fibers are much longer than cotton fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why what's traditionally
done, at least in the US, is
[SPEAKER_00]: cottonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cottonization is, is cutting fiber
hemp fibers down so that they can be spun
[SPEAKER_00]: on cotton equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in other countries, like in China,
they have other spinning equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: like wet spinning and so on, where you
don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some of the folks in our College
of Textiles are purchasing some
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale spinning equipment that is
specifically built for spinning of
[SPEAKER_00]: long-staple fiber so that we don't have to
cottonize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look across the nation,
we are built on cotton processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the time being, if we're going to
use that equipment, it's going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cottonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any fiber processing in New
York?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a lot of movement in
New York for more, I hate to say
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial applications, but more things
like hempcrete or construction and that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry Smart would be a great person to ask
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What varieties were used in our nitrogen
and density study?
[SPEAKER_00]: We used Yuma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conda Hemp, the company that we got the
seed from, is just selling Yuma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing any of the numbered
lines now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Yuma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we are using for the
time being until we get some other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that work well in our latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing with the herds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Charles, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, we are more or less just
giving it away to other researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in our College of Textiles,
that are looking at other ways to valorize
[SPEAKER_00]: herd, whether it's pulping and making
packaging or paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really interesting conversation
with a researcher in our bio and ag
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he thinks he has a microbe that
can digest it, and we can make a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: whiskey out of it, which will either be
really cool or really disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it would be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not be the first person to try it
because it just sounds dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are folks that are working on
herd processing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But admittedly, in North Carolina,
the industry seems to be much more geared
[SPEAKER_00]: towards bast production for the time
being.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing to note about fiber
hemp is that bast production alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's going to be enough
for a farmer when we talk about profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty we can do with herd,
and farmers are going to need to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to benefit from the profit they can
generate from the herd as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thomas, you asked a great question about
turning the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our redding study, and I'm glad you
brought this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mention this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least for the bundles of hemp that
we were pulling out of the field for
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, Ashley was going in and turning
them because that's something that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: in general to get good, even redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave them in the field and not
turn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, if you want better redding
and faster redding, turning is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share my contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adriana, I hope I'm pronouncing that
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My contact information is, I will put it
in the webinar chat, at least my email
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm running through these quickly,
but there's a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can cut me off whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any publication on the ranges of cellulose
and lignin content?
[SPEAKER_00]: Joan, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a lot of research out
there that has quantified cellulose and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemicellulose and lignin in a lot of
feedstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, when you look in the literature,
it may not necessarily be a paper on fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: production, but it's just general
feedstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're looking at using fiber
hemp for biochar or digesting for
[SPEAKER_00]: biofuels, those are the papers where
you'll see that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a few other papers that I've
seen that are fiber specific that do also
[SPEAKER_00]: look in the cellulose content or the
lignin content and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luis, have you seen any effects on the end
rates on redding time and processability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxurious end uptake can lead to longer
redding times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting, Luis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't look at that in our nitrogen
rate trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because you brought that up,
I'm going to talk to Ashley about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp certainly will likely do luxury
consumption of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really think that fiber hemp,
at least for this purpose, requires that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's probably going to be
somewhere around 100 to 150 pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: acre, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a really interesting point
about that luxury consumption of what its
[SPEAKER_00]: effects are on redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Luis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another question in the webinar
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the performance difference between
dual purpose and fiber only genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing here to understand is
that if you're going for dual purpose,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means I'm letting my plant go to full
maturity, or at least to the point where I
[SPEAKER_00]: can harvest seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that it's likely going
to be harder to process that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more lignin in the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more secondary fiber
in the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fibers will likely be thicker,
in general, when we go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology of the fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that material may not, the fibers,
I should say, may not necessarily be the
[SPEAKER_00]: best for, say, like apparel, a shirt,
or some other type of textile application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other side of it is in dual
purpose, you're getting grain as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And immediately, I'm quite excited about
dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's going to require a lot from
machinery investment to harvest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's another way for farmers
to really maximize yield and profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mauro, your question on business
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to answer questions on
business models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not the right person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can certainly put you in touch with
folks that handle more of the exercise of
economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one thing I will tell you in
general about the industry is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: always have this chicken and egg issue,
where you have companies that want the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, but they're unwilling to,
say, invest in processing infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't see people growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got farmers that want to
grow it, but they're not going to grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's nowhere to get it
processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is allowing, I think,
the industry in North Carolina to move
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, I shouldn't say quickly,
but move at a faster pace is that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing more processors pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have processing capabilities
where you are, it's going to be very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to get this crop off the ground,
so to speak, this industry off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you really want to look
into processing, but also understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: where is the demand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to buy this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I build the processes and can
process hundreds of acres, thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: acres, who's going to buy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Leo, can you discuss the benefits
mentioned in regards to clothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: textile made from hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that I'm going to venture
into a realm where I know enough to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous, but I'm no textile expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that makes the hemp from
fiber really great is its durability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where hemp fits in is, when you
think about denim, when you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: workwear, like Patagonia's got their
workwear line, anything that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be under a lot of abrasion but still needs
to hold its shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is highly durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I highly doubt we will ever get
to a point where you're seeing 100% hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: shirts and other things like that,
because it doesn't wear like cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as soft as cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're often seeing a lot of cotton and
hemp blends, so you get the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that the textile industry
gets really excited about is that they see
[SPEAKER_00]: the fibers from fiber hemp being a
replacement for a lot of the synthetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that are put in a cotton synthetic blend,
fill in the blank, shirt, sock,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really cool sustainability
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting rid of these synthetics that
are generated from oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with farmers who are growing
the cotton and the fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a much better story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I think I would
love to wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a number of other
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our researchers are working with
the military and looking at garments that
[SPEAKER_00]: have fiber hemp in them for folks that are
in the Navy or are going to be in and out
[SPEAKER_00]: of water regularly, because hemp holds its
shape much better in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are a number of other
benefits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is quite a unique and breathable
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philip, can you talk more about your
decortication efforts with your partner?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that relationship developed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really understand the question,
Philip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about the companies,
they have basically just been popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've seen that there's a need for it
and that it wasn't being met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're business folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really trying to get in as soon
as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really appreciate so far about the
decorticators that I've been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: here in North Carolina is that they
understand that this is a work in
[SPEAKER_00]: progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they understand that this is a new
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they understand that farmers are going
to have challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just purely business right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, some of the decorticators
right now are paying more or less a flat
[SPEAKER_00]: fee for farmers for a specific acreage,
regardless of yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand that it eventually will go
to much more of a traditional yield
[SPEAKER_00]: quality system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate their willingness to work
with the farmer and to help them along the
[SPEAKER_00]: way as this industry develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's the question you
meant to ask, or if that's the answer you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could certainly answer when you come
to North Carolina, which I think you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what extent, if any, is Congress' FDA
stagnation in regulating cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting the growth of the fiber industry
in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a concern with those Chinese
varieties going hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has not been what's limiting
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, it's just been industry pull and
getting these processors up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid side is certainly a
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not limiting producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not keeping producers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, though, that the burden of
paperwork and having to get an FBI
[SPEAKER_00]: background check and all of that to get a
license certainly does keep farmers from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in hemp that may haven't before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them just don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess in that regard, that's where
some of that governmental burden is
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting production and the adoption of
this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, David, thank you so much for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's now a little bit past 2 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you answered so many questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll be getting a recording of
all of the hemp webinar talks up onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell SIPP's YouTube page in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people can re-watch this if they're
interested or share it with other people
[SPEAKER_02]: they know would be interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, I think we're going to say
goodbye until two weeks from now when we
[SPEAKER_02]: have Trey Riddle from IND Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to join that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
