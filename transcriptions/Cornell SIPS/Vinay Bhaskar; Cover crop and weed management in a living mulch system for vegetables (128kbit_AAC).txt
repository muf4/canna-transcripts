[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for most of this talk, I will be
focusing on the living mulch trials that
[SPEAKER_06]: we conducted in tomato at our vegetable
research from Freeville.
[SPEAKER_06]: But alongside those tomato plots,
we also conducted the sole cover crop
[SPEAKER_06]: trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: The intention of the sole cover crop
trials, it did not have any cash crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the intention there was to evaluate
more herbicide treatments, and also to use
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides that are not registered for use
in tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, because it's very similar to the
tomato trials, I will not be discussing
[SPEAKER_06]: that today.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the summer and fall of 2016,
we also conducted greenhouse experiments
[SPEAKER_06]: at the Goodman Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was to look at potential release
of nitrogen from the root of living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches under herbicide stress,
from chemical stress from herbicide
[SPEAKER_06]: applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that also, we did not see any evidence
of nitrate release.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I won't be talking about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will be talking about my master's
project, which was the first series of
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch trials that we conducted in
the cotton systems in central India in
[SPEAKER_06]: 2012 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in 2013, for which, in an outstanding
state of affairs, I would leave just in
[SPEAKER_06]: time for an Indian summer and be back just
in time for the winter here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So since all of these experiments are
based on living mulches, just a quick
[SPEAKER_06]: introduction on what living mulches are
and their benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So living mulches are essentially cover
crops or companion crops that are grown
[SPEAKER_06]: alongside the cash crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And typically, they don't have any
economic value.
[SPEAKER_06]: And their primary purpose is soil
conservation.
[SPEAKER_06]: They help to cover the soil surface,
especially between the interval spaces of
[SPEAKER_06]: the crop, really quickly before the onset
of the rains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this helps to minimize soil
displacement by raindrops or wind.
[SPEAKER_06]: They also help to reduce surface runoff
and thereby the movement of pesticides and
[SPEAKER_06]: fertilizers off the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: Living mulches are also an excellent way
to increase the resource use efficiency of
[SPEAKER_06]: the agro ecosystem and thereby produce
more biomass and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vigorous stands of living mulches can also
be useful in removing water quickly in
[SPEAKER_06]: clay soils that are prone to water
stagnation.
[SPEAKER_06]: One other very interesting and important
outcome of living mulches is that the
[SPEAKER_06]: presence of living mulches make intero
cultivation during the season very
[SPEAKER_06]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the adoption of a living mulch
system is an excellent deterrent to
[SPEAKER_06]: excessive tillage.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of weed suppression, the presence
of living mulches reduces the diurnal
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuations of light and temperature in
the soil, which are very important
[SPEAKER_06]: triggers for weed seed germination.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have less weed pressure during the
season.
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the season, besides the direct
competition with the weeds, by providing a
[SPEAKER_06]: more competitive environment in the intero
space, when weeds experience this
[SPEAKER_06]: increased competition in the intero space,
they tend to allocate less resources
[SPEAKER_06]: towards production of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, again, is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, the first set of trials that
we conducted in cotton.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was conducted in the central
region of India, which is the cotton belt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the warmest region in India.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is very conducive for cotton
cultivation, along with the black,
[SPEAKER_06]: clay, vertisol soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is also very conducive for cotton
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in many ways, the topography and also
the climate is very similar to the
[SPEAKER_06]: southwestern region of the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: So each year, this was conducted in 2012
and 2013.
[SPEAKER_06]: And each year, we had four different
sites.
[SPEAKER_06]: One at the agronomy research farm at the
local agricultural university.
[SPEAKER_06]: And three of them were on-farm trials and
private growers fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the grower fields were two to three
miles from each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were all about 15 miles from the
research farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: At each site, we tested five different
species of living mulches, along with one
[SPEAKER_06]: control, which was hand-weeded and
weed-free.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cotton was planted in June.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was seeded in a row spacing of five
feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And between two rows of cotton,
we had three to four rows of living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were the different treatments that
we tested at the different sites and
[SPEAKER_06]: different years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glyrosidia and lab lab, they were tested
only during the second year, because they
[SPEAKER_06]: were used as replacements for two other
species that did not emerge at all in year
[SPEAKER_06]: one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we discarded those and replaced them
with Glyrosidia and lab lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also lost two sites during year
one, because the grower ended up in
[SPEAKER_06]: prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: But during the second year, we had all the
living mulch species and all the sites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were the different species of living
mulches that we used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of them, except the sorghum
sudangrass, they were legumes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had suspania, we had glyrosidia,
sorghum sudangrass, lab lab, and sun ham.
[SPEAKER_06]: And lab lab, also known as dolicose bean,
is an edible bean.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we tested lab lab as a marketable
vegetable intercrop and not as a true
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did not collect biomass or any other
data from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did not use any herbicides pre or
post-emergent in these trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also did not have any
inter-cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only management operation that we used
for the living mulches, where we would cut
[SPEAKER_06]: them back to a height that was suitable
for their regeneration, which was about 40
[SPEAKER_06]: to 45 centimeters from the soil surface,
every time they reached a height of about
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 centimeters from the top of the cotton
canopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we expected that in such a system,
the living mulches would provide
[SPEAKER_06]: substantial, would provide good wheat
suppression and soil cover and produce
[SPEAKER_06]: considerable amounts of biomass and all
this without adversely affecting the
[SPEAKER_06]: cotton yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: The results were actually much better than
what we expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually saw a positive relationship
between cotton yield and living mulch
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a solid line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was confirmed by the by another
positive relationship between cotton yield
[SPEAKER_06]: and living mulch biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in cotton, the increased height of the
plants is also, in most cases,
[SPEAKER_06]: it also shows better growth because the
increased height also mostly means
[SPEAKER_06]: increased ball formation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a positive result.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 2013 was a relatively wet year,
but 2012 was very dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we looked at this year alone,
there was a negative correlation between
[SPEAKER_06]: cotton yield and living mulch biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would see very similar results in
the tomato trial also.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially, good soil moisture
conditions were essential for success of
[SPEAKER_06]: the living mulch system.
[SPEAKER_06]: This graph shows the average cotton yield
at different levels of the living mulch
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass for different species.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the average cotton yields at
each level of the biomass, average of all
[SPEAKER_06]: the species at each level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the cotton yield from the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see that initially there's a decline in
cotton yield with the presence of living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there is an increase with the
increase in living mulch biomass to even
[SPEAKER_06]: above the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe that this is because the living
mulches here, which produced less biomass
[SPEAKER_06]: and were less vigorous in the weaker
living mulch stands where they were unable
[SPEAKER_06]: to suppress the weeds adequately.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the weeds that caused
reductions in cotton yield here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is supported by this graph,
which again is similar, except it has weed
[SPEAKER_06]: ground cover on the y-axis and not cotton
yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can see here the increased weed
presence in the lower biomass,
[SPEAKER_06]: lower living mulch biomass plots,
which corresponds to the decrease in
[SPEAKER_06]: cotton yield here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the inset graph at the top is just to
confirm the strong negative relationship
[SPEAKER_06]: that weed pressure had with both living
mulch biomass and living mulch cover.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, we would see such relationships
in the tomato trials too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And moving on to the tomato trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were conducted in the home mercy
Thompson vegetable research farm at
[SPEAKER_06]: Freeville.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we discussed briefly the different
benefits of having living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are two main challenges to their
adoption.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their competition with the cash crop,
which leads to yield losses, and then
[SPEAKER_06]: their unreliable weed control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when herbicides are used along with
living mulches, there's a potential that
[SPEAKER_06]: this combination can complement each
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the herbicides would assist the living
mulches in weed suppression while at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time suppressing the vigor of the
living mulches itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wouldn't compete with the cash crop
as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we have seen before, the living
mulches also are capable of contributing
[SPEAKER_06]: towards weed suppression themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so here there's a potential to
decrease herbicide application rates
[SPEAKER_06]: because the living mulches also are also
contributing towards weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this translates into reductions in
herbicide input.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for such a system to work,
the herbicide must of course be registered
[SPEAKER_06]: for use in the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the living mulches must be sensitive
to the herbicides used.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the application rates of the
herbicide must be low enough that the
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulches are able to recover.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the herbicide applications must be
able to target weeds disproportionately
[SPEAKER_06]: more than the living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we do not have a lot of
herbicides to work with in vegetables,
[SPEAKER_06]: in our trials, this was primarily achieved
by the larger size of the living mulches
[SPEAKER_06]: at the time of first herbicide
application.
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically, the living mulches would
emerge much sooner than the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would be about 20 to 25
centimeters tall at the time of weed
[SPEAKER_06]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the herbicide application would affect
the smaller weeds more than the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used two species of living mulches,
which we used in the cotton trials also,
[SPEAKER_06]: Suspania and Sunhemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Suspania did not emerge that well
during any of the years that we tested it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the results that are presented here
focus on Sunhemp alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple of reasons why we chose
the temperature for the herbicide
application.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, we chose a tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomato can be planted in white rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, tomato has relatively more
herbicides that are registered for use in
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had more herbicides to work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We chose four different herbicides,
Rimsulfuron, Fumisafen, Metribucin,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Halosulfuron.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these were applied.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the herbicide treatments were applied
post-emergence.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used no pre-emergent applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we categorized these herbicides into
two types based on the sensitivity of the
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulches to these herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the type one herbicides caused more
living mulch injury than type two
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides at the applied rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And each herbicide treatment consisted of
one application each of two different
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had four herbicide treatments,
and these were used along with the control
[SPEAKER_06]: which was hand-weeded, weed-free.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had no living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: An untreated check, where the living
mulches were not treated with any
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the weedy check, which had no
living mulches or herbicide applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a brief explanation of the
experimental setup.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, the living mulches were planted in
the field using a grain drill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since it's hard to work with,
since the stony soils are kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_06]: work with, so that we were able to
transplant the tomatoes deep enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used a tractor to make furrows where
the tomato plants would go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the furrows were about eight inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the tomatoes were
hand-transplanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Irrigation was provided whenever required,
which was all the time in 2016 and never
[SPEAKER_06]: in 2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a typical living mulch stand
in early August.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this was conducted at the Homer
C.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thompson Vegetable Research Farm in
Freeville, New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first trial was in 2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a preliminary trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then, in 2015, we made a few
modifications to the treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 2015 trial was replicated in 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plots were 12 feet by 15 feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the tomatoes were planted in rows four
feet wide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And between two rows of tomatoes,
we had three rows of living mulch with a
[SPEAKER_06]: row spacing of 23 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the row spacing between the living
mulch and the living mulch rows was 23
[SPEAKER_06]: centimeters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the distance between the living mulch
row and the tomato row on either side was
[SPEAKER_06]: 46 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the hypothesis was similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: We assumed that the combination of living
mulches and herbicides would provide
[SPEAKER_06]: adequate suppression of both weeds and the
living mulch while also providing
[SPEAKER_06]: considerable soil cover and living mulch
biomass and all this without affecting
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: We collected living mulch, wheat,
tomato, and soil parameters.
[SPEAKER_06]: The living mulch height and ground cover
and the wheat ground cover, they were
[SPEAKER_06]: measured at four different times during
the growing season.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biomass and the density was measured
immediately before the beginning of tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also for analysis of the nutrient
composition, tomato leaf tissue was
[SPEAKER_06]: sampled at the time of peat tomato
flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: So coming to yield results.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2015, the tomato yield from the
herbicide treatments did not differ
[SPEAKER_06]: significantly from the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were a little lower, but they were
not significantly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in 2016, the tomato yield from the
herbicide treatments were similar to each
[SPEAKER_06]: other, but significantly lower than the
tomato yield from the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: The control is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we can see from the different
scales on the y-axis, 2015 was not a great
[SPEAKER_06]: year for tomatoes because it was really
wet and there was a lot of disease
[SPEAKER_06]: incidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So under such circumstances, we expected
that the presence of the living mulch
[SPEAKER_06]: would make the tomato plants more
vulnerable to disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, again, in 2015, like in the
current trial, we saw a positive
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship between tomato yield and
living mulch biomass, which is surprising
[SPEAKER_06]: but good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any reductions in tomato yield was not
caused by the living mulch themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the same year, there was a negative
relationship between wheat biomass and
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: The significance, it was not truly
significant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was marginally significant with a
p-value of 0.07, which is why I have the
[SPEAKER_06]: bar graphs here to show the trend.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the decreasing order of treatments in
terms of tomato yield was almost identical
[SPEAKER_06]: to the increasing order of treatments in
terms of wheat biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clearly, it was probably the weeds that
was causing any reductions in tomato yield
[SPEAKER_06]: and not the living mulch itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very similar to what we saw in the
cotton trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in 2015, in terms of living mulch
biomass, the living mulch biomass from the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide treatments were similar to the
untreated check, which means that the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide treatments did not reduce the
living mulch biomass considerably.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in the wheat biomass,
even though the wheat biomass is not
[SPEAKER_06]: significant, significantly different
between treatments, just the drastic
[SPEAKER_06]: numerical differences between wheat
biomass and the herbicide treatments and
[SPEAKER_06]: the untreated check and the weedy check
show that the herbicide treatments were
[SPEAKER_06]: able to disproportionately target the
weeds and not the living mulch.
[SPEAKER_06]: In both 2015 and 2016, there was no
relationship between wheat biomass and
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch biomass, which means that in
both years, the herbicide applications
[SPEAKER_06]: were very important for weed control.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2016, unlike in 2015, there was a
negative relationship between tomato yield
[SPEAKER_06]: and the living mulch biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: 2016 was a very dry year, and it was
likely that this outcome, this was an
[SPEAKER_06]: outcome of competition for water,
between the living mulch and the tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: If this were the case, then in 2015,
the positive relationship that we saw
[SPEAKER_06]: between tomato yield and the living mulch
biomass was most likely because 2015 was a
[SPEAKER_06]: wet year, which did not provoke any
competition for water between the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulch and the tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2016, the living mulches also in an
indirect way caused reductions in tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: This graph shows the calcium concentration
in leaf tissue with increasing living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulch biomass, and there's a negative
correlation.
[SPEAKER_06]: In plots with vigorous living mulches,
the calcium concentration in the leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: tissue is lower.
[SPEAKER_06]: In dry conditions, dry conditions can
reduce the capacity of tomato crops to
[SPEAKER_06]: take in calcium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides the direct competition of the
living mulches for water with the tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: crop, the living mulch has also caused
calcium deficiency in the tomato crop,
[SPEAKER_06]: which led to yield losses.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2014, this graph here shows a
relationship between tomato yield and
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch biomass, which was again
negative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the summer of 2014,
was a cold year, it was not dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could not be the competition for water
that was causing this relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the same year, there was a
positive, this was again surprising,
[SPEAKER_06]: there was a positive relationship between
weed pressure and living mulch biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weed pressure was more in plots with
more vigorous living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it was likely that it was the weeds
it was the weed cover that was,
[SPEAKER_06]: weed pressure that was causing the
reductions in tomato yield and not the
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: This relationship, this negative
relationship between tomato yield and
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch biomass was most likely
because of the positive association of
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulch biomass with weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: This strong negative correlation between
tomato yield and weed cover further
[SPEAKER_06]: confirms this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The anomalous positive relationship of
weed cover with living mulch biomass was
[SPEAKER_06]: most likely because the living mulches
were unable to control the weeds
[SPEAKER_06]: adequately by themselves without
sufficient assistance from the herbicide
[SPEAKER_06]: applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I mentioned before, the herbicide
treatments in 2014 were different from
[SPEAKER_06]: 2015 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2014, the herbicide treatments
consisted of two applications of a single
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide at a fixed rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: In those plots which received weaker
herbicide applications, the herbicides did
[SPEAKER_06]: not affect the living mulches that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an increase in living mulch
biomass, but they also did not affect the
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds that much and the weed biomass also
increased.
[SPEAKER_06]: This led to decreased tomato yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in case of the stronger herbicide
applications, it suppressed the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches more, but it also suppressed the
weeds more and it provided better tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since this, in 2015, modifications were
made to the treatments so that the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide applications would target the
weeds more effectively and asymmetrically.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2015, like we saw, these modifications
along with the lack of competition for
[SPEAKER_06]: water showed clearly the positive
relationship that is possible between
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulches and the cash crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very quickly, to talk about the sole cover
crop trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in much detail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very similar to the tomato trial,
but the plots were smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not have any cash crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had many more treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tested 12 herbicide combinations.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea was also to understand the best
herbicide combinations that would be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to target weeds disproportionately more.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be the best times for
application?
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be the best rates in the
herbicides themselves?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, we were also able to test two new
herbicides that are not registered for use
[SPEAKER_06]: in tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dual Magnum and Imazetopyr.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had six herbicides and 12 combinations.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just one result that we saw from
the sole cover crop trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we used many different treatments in
the sole cover crop trials, we decided to
[SPEAKER_06]: group them into the order of application
of the two types of herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had earlier grouped the herbicides into
two different types.
[SPEAKER_06]: Type one herbicide affects the living
mulches more.
[SPEAKER_06]: The living mulches are more sensitive to
type one herbicide over type two
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, we grouped all these herbicides and
the treatment combinations into the order
[SPEAKER_06]: of application of the type of herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, we saw that the first application of
a type one herbicide caused reductions in
[SPEAKER_06]: the cover crop biomass compared to the
first applications of a type two
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was most likely because when a type
one herbicide, which is a stronger
[SPEAKER_06]: post-emergent herbicide, was applied
first, the initial application,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is in late June, the living mulches
were still small at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: These stronger herbicide applications
affected them more severely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The recovery time was also longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: During this time, there was an increase in
weed pressure, which further suppressed
[SPEAKER_06]: the living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was what probably caused the decrease
in living mulch biomass here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the opposite in case of the type
two herbicides, because the first
[SPEAKER_06]: application of a type two herbicide means
the living mulches had to deal with a
[SPEAKER_06]: weaker herbicide in the first application.
[SPEAKER_06]: In case of the weed biomass, the type
[SPEAKER_06]: one herbicides are weaker post-emergent
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: They affect the living mulches less.
[SPEAKER_06]: The living mulches are more sensitive to
the type one herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: The type one herbicides are more sensitive
to the type one herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: and less sensitive to the type 2
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in case of weed biomass, the type 2
plus type 1, the first application of a
[SPEAKER_06]: type 2 herbicide was most effective in
weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was likely because during the
first application of a type 2 herbicide,
[SPEAKER_06]: which did not affect the living mulch as
much, since the living mulches are already
[SPEAKER_06]: larger in size, at the time of first
application, larger in size than the
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: The type 2 herbicides did not probably
affect the living mulch as much,
[SPEAKER_06]: but affected the smaller weeds much more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what this provided for the living
mulch was a window of low competition
[SPEAKER_06]: during which it could establish well
enough to withstand application of a type
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 herbicide, which would again
disproportionately target the weeds more,
[SPEAKER_06]: because the weeds are smaller in size.
[SPEAKER_06]: And
[SPEAKER_06]: so in quick summary, absence of dry
conditions might be essential to prevent
[SPEAKER_06]: yield losses in living mulch systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And herbicide applications might be
essential for adequate weed control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in a cropping system, there are many
factors that can be manipulated so that
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide input is reduced and so that the
herbicide applications are able to target
[SPEAKER_06]: the weeds disproportionately more.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once these factors are established,
it is important that the strength of the
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicide application is based on
achieving adequate weed control and not on
[SPEAKER_06]: achieving a target living mulch biomass or
living mulch cover, because even vigorous
[SPEAKER_06]: living mulches can be unreliable in the
context of crop yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did find that the combination of
living mulches and herbicides did work
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They suppressed weeds well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They provided good soil cover.
[SPEAKER_06]: They produced considerable amounts of
biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also showed potential in their
ability to not affect the crop yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were also able to reduce the
application rates of the herbicides by up
[SPEAKER_06]: to 75% in Metribucin and 81% in
Grim-Sulfuron.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, also from our trials,
results which I've not really shown here
[SPEAKER_06]: today, we found that it would be valuable
to develop more methods to further reduce
[SPEAKER_06]: the height of the living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that provides opportunity for future
study.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I would like to acknowledge the
help and support that I've received.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the outset, I would like to thank,
I would like to acknowledge my gratitude
[SPEAKER_06]: to Robin Belanger, who took me on as a
graduate student.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to also thank my graduate
committee, Steve Reiners, Tony DiTomaso in
[SPEAKER_06]: Soil and Crop Sciences, and Mike Walter in
Biological and Environmental Engineering.
[SPEAKER_06]: My thanks also to the lab and farm crew,
Peter, Swanko, Rebecca in Robin's lab,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Steve Rick and all the other free will
crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in the Vidarbha project, I would like
to acknowledge my gratitude to the faculty
[SPEAKER_06]: and staff at the PDKV University and all
the growers that collaborated with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my thanks also to the Northeastern
SAER, the TSF, and the Tata Cornell
[SPEAKER_06]: Initiative for their financial support.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, thank you and I'll take this
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was how these results
translate into the real world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we conduct similar experiments in
different crops using different herbicides
[SPEAKER_06]: and different living mulches, and we are
able to create a database of different
[SPEAKER_06]: application rates, different herbicides
and living mulches that we can use in
[SPEAKER_06]: different crops in different regions,
then we might be able to provide the
[SPEAKER_06]: growers with a ready-to-use package of
practices that they can immediately
[SPEAKER_06]: implement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would be towards reduction in
herbicide input and soil conservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you in contact with people in the
field translating this?
[SPEAKER_06]: A few extension agents.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was, am I in contact with
people on the field regarding the
[SPEAKER_06]: dissemination of this information?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been a few field days and other
presentations that I've been a part of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked with maybe a couple of
extension agents in the Crayon Cooperative
[SPEAKER_06]: Extension.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Mountain Fresh, the tomato,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that determinate or indeterminate
variety, and would that have any effect on
[SPEAKER_03]: the results you may have seen?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was if the tomato variety
that we chose, the Mountain Fresh,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it was determinate or if so,
would that factor have influenced the
[SPEAKER_06]: results?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Mountain Fresh was indeed supposed
to be a determinate variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it turned out that it wasn't really
that determinate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we ended up harvesting it maybe three
times each year.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2014, this was a really good year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We harvested up to five times.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not sure if it would have
influenced the results any, because the
[SPEAKER_06]: sampling that we conducted before the
beginning of tomato harvest for the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulch biomass and the process of tomato
harvest, too, was pretty destructive on
[SPEAKER_06]: the living mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is unlikely that it would have seen
much of an effect moving from the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning of tomato harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a commercial crop that you're
using, the Mountain Fresh?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a commercially grown fresh market
tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vinay, this may be a focus for future
study, but it would seem that it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: an economic appeal of using a harvestable
living mulch like the lab lab you did in
[SPEAKER_02]: that one experiment and not using
herbicides so that both the primary crop
[SPEAKER_02]: and the living mulch crop could contribute
to the value of the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: True.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was if we used a
marketable living mulch and without
[SPEAKER_06]: herbicides, if that would make the system
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the reasons, at least when we
began the living mulch trials,
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the reasons why we chose
non-marketable living mulches was because
[SPEAKER_06]: in the cotton cultivation, there was very
little residue that was going back into
[SPEAKER_06]: the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cotton itself does not produce that much
leaf litter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the stems, the booty stems are removed
from the field for use as fuel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was very little residue that was
going back into the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the idea was to use a living mulch
that would stay in the field, that would
[SPEAKER_06]: not be taken out, would not be used for
anything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: To provide more organic content.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the soil, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the primary concern in the
trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought we would like to keep it
that way so that there is all the residue
[SPEAKER_05]: goes back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the goal of your research is to get
away from the herbicide, because otherwise
[SPEAKER_05]: you're polluting the climate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was if our primary
objective is to reduce herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, we were trying to reduce
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what you think is happening
with respect to nitrogen in these systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you mentioned that most of these
are legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would that be another advantage to add
nitrogen through nitrogen fixation instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of relying upon nitrogen inputs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you look at that, or do you know
others?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was if the nitrogen
fixation of the legume living mulches was
[SPEAKER_06]: a consideration of these trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the first trial, yes it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have to inoculate it,
because the inoculant was present in the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Naturally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it did produce, there was a lot of
inoculation, and we believe there was
[SPEAKER_06]: considerable amounts of nitrogen that was
fixed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though we did not measure it,
that might have helped the cotton crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in case of the trials we conducted at
Freeville, the living mulches were not
[SPEAKER_06]: inoculated, and we did not see any
inoculation there.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the idea behind not inoculating
it was to make it more competitive in the
[SPEAKER_06]: interval space with regard to the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in 2016, we did have an
inoculated strip of sun ham adjacent to
[SPEAKER_06]: the main tomato trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, and the inoculation was
excellent, and the growth was excellent,
[SPEAKER_06]: but what we saw was when you inoculate the
sun ham, the tomato yield is horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the reason is, and this is
visible from the field too, I think the
[SPEAKER_06]: availability of nitrogen makes the living
mulches too vigorous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It cannot be controlled with the herbicide
rates that we use, and they just get out
[SPEAKER_06]: of control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the shading is a very important factor
in reducing the tomato yields too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even other than that, just from the
increased availability of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it also made the living mulches
more competitive for other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And water, light, and so it wasn't really
good on the tomato crop at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the natural inoculant?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a rhizobia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a strain of, so the question was what
the natural inoculant is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a strain of rhizobium bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: More basic question, what got you to think
about using living mulches that are from
[SPEAKER_00]: subtropical, tropical regions in the
Northeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what was the rationale for having
you, why not use more typical kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: living mulches for our region?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was, what was the
rationale behind using tropical living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches in the tomato trial in the
Northeast in the United States,
[SPEAKER_06]: and why not use more locally used
varieties?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the main reason was we needed to find
the big mulch that the architecture of the
[SPEAKER_06]: growth was very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sun Hem was one that provided it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was direct.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't creeping.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't pushy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would disturb the tomato canopy,
the crop canopy less.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also wanted, we chose tropical
mulches because we felt it would be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to better take advantage of the summer
climate and grow very quickly and rapidly,
[SPEAKER_06]: produce lots of biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also an important consideration was
that being tropical, the chances of it
[SPEAKER_06]: setting seed was very unlikely because it
would be killed at the first hint of
[SPEAKER_06]: frost.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the tropical varieties relate to
Ithaca climate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you look into that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, how does the tropical
living mulch varieties translate into the
[SPEAKER_06]: Ithaca climate and why do you use that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I mentioned before, the idea was
to use living mulches that would be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to take advantage of the summer climate
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would have a growth structure
that would not disturb the tomato canopy
[SPEAKER_06]: as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also wanted living mulches that
would not set seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so being tropical, it helps because it
dies much before the first frost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how long is the growing region in
Ithaca?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, how long is the
growing season in Ithaca?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's typically from end of May through end
of September.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that a short region?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a short period of time compared to
other regions?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, is the growing region
in Ithaca shorter compared to other
[SPEAKER_06]: regions?
[SPEAKER_06]: The growing season in Ithaca is shorter
compared to the southern parts of the
[SPEAKER_06]: United States compared to the tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But compared to the Northeast,
it's not much different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vinay, can we see if Geneva has any
questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Geneva.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you tell us when did you turn the
living mulch crops in your tomato farm?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when did I plant the living mulch
crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: Terminate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was, when did we terminate
the living mulch crops and living mulches
[SPEAKER_06]: in the tomato farms?
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not actually do any termination
operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Towards the end of the tomato harvest in
most seasons, the cover crop, the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulches died by themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of the cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even after the tomato trials,
we would leave what was left of the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulch in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the tomato crop, along with the living
mulches, would be plowed under towards the
[SPEAKER_06]: end of October when they prepared the
field for the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when did they naturally die out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it September, late September?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was, when they naturally
died off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it was in late September.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could even tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious, if this research
continues, is there any potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: doing some sort of cost analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned at the beginning that
typically living mulches don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're reducing weeds or increasing
weed suppression and reducing herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: application, then perhaps that can provide
some economic incentive for growers
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious if any cost analysis has
been done?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was, have we done any cost
analysis on using a living mulch that has
[SPEAKER_06]: no economic value, if it has been done
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or if you think about doing it in
the future, if anyone is interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been many studies on cost
analysis of marketable ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in the tropics and from the
southern regions of the United States and
[SPEAKER_06]: in Australia, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there have been a lot of economic
analysis on intercropping, multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in case of living mulches itself with
no economic value, I'm not familiar with
[SPEAKER_06]: any studies that have gone into the
details of the benefits of the living
[SPEAKER_06]: mulch in the subsequent years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what effect it would have on the cash
profit itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to thank Vinay for an excellent
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vinay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
