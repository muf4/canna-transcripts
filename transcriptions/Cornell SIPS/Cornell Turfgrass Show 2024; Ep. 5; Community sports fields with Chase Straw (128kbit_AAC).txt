[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the great parts of this gig here at
Cornell is going in and out of the city
[SPEAKER_02]: every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City is a fascinating place where
grass meets people and I got a chance to
[SPEAKER_02]: walk on, as the moonlight was out,
the old Lincoln Center roof that I worked
[SPEAKER_02]: on many years ago back in 2009 when they
built this roof and put the grass on it a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a beautiful night and
wandering around Central Park with Zach
[SPEAKER_02]: Holmes on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Landscape management there of which sports
turf is involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, Carl, we can't start out
without something ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope nobody was hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy looks like he went off the road
or off an embankment or hit the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: button.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy said maybe he didn't like our
pin placements that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you never know with these kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Carl, we've been talking a lot
about putting animals to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a common trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy doesn't look so happy about it
this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he didn't get a good night's sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's not thrilled about having to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a big melancholy shout out to Tom
Kaplan, the current president of NYSTA,
[SPEAKER_02]: just had to put his dog down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big thing in our industry with
the connection between dogs and our work
[SPEAKER_02]: life and our personal life and our
emotional well-being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when these things happen, it's always
good to share it with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a person who didn't grow up with a dog,
but then had a dog, I sort of realized,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, this thing hits pretty hard when it
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just in case anybody was wondering,
whether I won the pie in the face contest,
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks to everybody who contributed to
this ridiculousness, we raised $600 for
[SPEAKER_02]: the farm neck group here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a member of the ag science faculty
here, I was happy to do it with my
[SPEAKER_02]: colleague, Mike Van Amberg in dairy
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Carl, I'm gonna do the weather
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna do the rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're gonna get right into a
little bit of me to set up our
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with Trent, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soils are still pretty cool, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, things are growing for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at our soil temperature
data, you know, just from a few days ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see we're still in the upper
forties, mid fifties.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sixties have moved down only into the
Delmarva peninsula, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last week, of course, was cooler than
normal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the departure,
you see it very cool along the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the big story this spring has been the
rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what's going on in the
south, Chase, but we are sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are half saturated here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as we get the conversation,
this has to be an element of a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with the kind of field you
choose to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what web of decision-making you
have to navigate or map of
[SPEAKER_02]: decision-making, you have to navigate when
it comes to climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's mentioned in your proposal
that we'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is, of course, something to
consider because you're in the heat of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring sports season now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here where we are, we're in the heat of
the spring sports season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the other thing is, you know,
we don't go crazy about this, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're a few weeks behind last
year, maybe only a week or so behind
[SPEAKER_02]: normal, but this is gonna change pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about this in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at Carl's growth model that
he's built here on the forecast website,
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, I gotta remember to put the QR code
up there so people can see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are listening on the podcast,
the forecast website really has this
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful growth model that picked up the
little bit of blip in growth we got last
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw it really in the research plots
as well, nice blip of growth, but you see
[SPEAKER_02]: that's returned to very slow growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like forecast for the next
few days are gonna be slow as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as we heard this morning on our
weekly conference call, it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be warm and dry for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very interesting pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went into a prolonged dry period Art
wasn't willing to put his neck on the line
[SPEAKER_02]: for going longer than eight to 10 days,
but certainly a period where we're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get some dry weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the other part I can't leave you
without thinking about our risk assessment
[SPEAKER_02]: tool on the forecast website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like as you get south,
the red risk is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look carefully at our weed
control, where we recommend the two 4D
[SPEAKER_02]: applications in the spring based on degree
day models, you can see it's also moving
[SPEAKER_02]: into that same area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is exactly what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, you raised a really good point
over the week when we were chatting about
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you see what happens when you get
obsessed with grass, every place you walk
[SPEAKER_02]: and go, you see these things everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a picture, people just finished
mowing this lawn by our botanic garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably at three and a half inches,
and it still remains filled with flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's not really the topic of today,
nor is this ridiculousness at Real Madrid
[SPEAKER_02]: Stadium, Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've had a chance to see
this craziness, but this is some other
[SPEAKER_02]: level hydraulic meeting of controlled
environment agriculture, vertical
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture with sports turf of all
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, as we sort of get to your rant,
that's the setup for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear a lot about these surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the lengths we go to to give them
a natural grass surface, Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is involved here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always talking about field
safety, right, Frank, and how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: manage the field specifically to meet
these certain thresholds or benchmarks,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's traction or firmness or ball
roll or ball bounce, however you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, the athlete is still
interacting with the surface with some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of footwear on their foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about this a bit with Andy
McNitt in past episodes, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of footwear is really important
in how it pertains to their performance
[SPEAKER_00]: and their safety on the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't take very long to figure out
that people have been trying to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: footwear for athletes for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at some of the research in
running, how the collar fits on your ankle
[SPEAKER_00]: changes your gait and how you decelerate
and turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The midsole thickness, apparently,
is a big factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how thick that sort of shoe sole is
influences how the energy transfers up
[SPEAKER_00]: your leg while you're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can have an injury risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also have a performance aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also look at, hey,
when you're running on concrete versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: rubber track, you should pick shoes that
have different sole depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on an unforgiving surface like
concrete, you need a larger depth because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want all that energy going back
up into your knee and your hip and
[SPEAKER_00]: elevating your injury risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shoes matter for performance and for
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy McNitt has looked at this a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about the traction
elements of footwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's looked at studies with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have their traction database
basically saying, hey, when you select a
[SPEAKER_00]: footwear that has a certain traction sort
of component, it's going to affect your
[SPEAKER_00]: injury risk, especially based on the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got this traction database at
the Penn State website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bermuda grass, Kentucky bluegrass,
field turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will give you the traction values
of specific footwear types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they say is, hey, the highest
traction value may be good for
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stick your foot in the ground and
change direction really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also increases your injury risk,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that shoe's not going to give,
something in that system is going to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably your ankle or your knee,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an athlete who can generate a
lot of force but can't then move,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to select a really high
traction shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to find something in the
middle that matches also the traction of
[SPEAKER_00]: the surfaces you're playing on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the interaction between the
surface and the footwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know people are different too,
right, Frank?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a little bit of research
with footwear and putting surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that different people cause
different amounts of disruption to putting
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, if you're watching
subject A, creates a lot more visual
[SPEAKER_00]: disruption to the putting surface than
subject B.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they walk a little bit
differently, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they apply force into the ground
is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this would say, hey,
if I'm a professional athlete and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize performance, but I also want
to minimize my injury risk, I should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably have a really sort of in-depth
detailed way to choose my shoes on game
[SPEAKER_00]: day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the NFL level, these are organizations
valued, I don't know, five to $10 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely there is someone on staff who can
select footwear based on the game day
[SPEAKER_00]: field and the athletes that are in that
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw this video a couple of months
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Hard Knocks, a documentary
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: They followed the Miami Dolphins last year
and before the playoff game in Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's their running backs coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the video, he's talking to the
running backs in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, hey guys, it's going to look like
a green field, but it's painted dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's painted dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you take a couple pairs of
shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two things that I don't like about
this, Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this is Arrowhead Stadium,
Travis Hogan, generally regarded as the
[SPEAKER_00]: gold standard of sports turf managers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody in the industry,
that field, that staff is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: level that we all aspire to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing calling this just
painted grass or painted dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is he's leaving this
decision about what footwear to choose up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will always choose the highest
traction shoe because it maximizes
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't have to go through a bunch
of literature and figure out, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: which one's the best for injury risk
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how should I measure the field before?
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be somebody on staff who's
making that decision during the games.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there is, and maybe this quote
is taken out of context, but man,
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels like this is a coach just saying,
hey guys, you got some shoes at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring a couple, run around a little bit
and you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, man, that does not seem like a
wise thing when you've got that amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: stakes, that amount of competition,
that amount of money involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's the rant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The rant is this should be safety
equipment, not something a running backs
[SPEAKER_02]: coach is advising unless he's got a brief
to address this particular issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think it's funny, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think about that, Carl,
how little it appears, and of course we
[SPEAKER_02]: could be taking this out of context.
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears not much thought seems to be
given, even though I've heard from John
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorokin and Andy that they put signs in
the locker rooms at these things about the
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of footwear that they recommend in
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it seems odd to me when data is such a
part of the game, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The analytics of like just a soccer game,
where on the field the action is taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chase has looked into this over the years,
but there's also the strategy of the way
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to play and where the traffic
winds up being concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Chase, this is interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you did a lot of work in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I want to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sort of set up, I sort of saw what Carl
was going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, oh, this is a perfect setup
for our pal, Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The footwear might be a hidden risk we
don't think about, but you've identified
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of variability in the field
and in your real great work, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically said, listen, there's a lot
of things that vary, but the important
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like soil moisture and hardening,
[SPEAKER_02]: it depends on how wet it is going in or
the existing variability in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter how it happens, there's going
to be some out there over a period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had to reconcile footwear and
inconsistencies, let's start at the
[SPEAKER_02]: highest level where they strive to make
them uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think those inconsistencies are
perceptible?
[SPEAKER_02]: By the athlete or in some ways also
contributing to the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I haven't seen these,
this figure in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, this is some of my early work,
you know, you know, it, it depends Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we talk professional sports,
it's so different now with the lay in
[SPEAKER_01]: place side and how much they're,
they're renovating the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So frequently, I don't know the degree of
within field variability at that level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but when you're talking about
some of the, the, the community level
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, uh, that, that I work on,
I mean, even collegiate level fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not renovating as frequently as
the professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there's a degree of,
of within field variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as long as you have a hundred
percent grass cover, that probably doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get into the athlete's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're on a, uh, you know,
a high school level, natural grass,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural soil, native soil field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, if we've done research,
we've interviewed athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recognize when there's no grass cover
or thin grass cover, and they actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust the way that they behave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would assume that their footwear and
footing would do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't looked at that specifically,
um, but I would assume that it would
[SPEAKER_01]: interact differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to be a blast from the past,
but this, but that variability that you
[SPEAKER_02]: identified is exactly what we wanted to
say is at the highest level, maybe this
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't an issue and those guys really need
to think about footwear because every,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the fields are as good as we can
get them, uh, at that level, one would
[SPEAKER_02]: hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a pretty good example of what
an average community field will look like
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in August, uh, when the players get
back and you've got crabgrass filling in,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to be going a flower soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now over the years, Chase, we've sort of
tried to address this on our sports turf
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this very simple tool that I've
used with school boards a couple of times
[SPEAKER_02]: and gone around with the ground staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talked about sort of how would you
rate this, have the guy ask a question,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure they understood what the grounds
manager knew, you know, start to create
[SPEAKER_02]: this community dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Carl passes along this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know he passed it on to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to start sort of with like the gold
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not entirely sure who did this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually we'll just put it out there
and see where all this came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a school district in California,
Fremont, California, it looks like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, presented something back in 2020 in
the fall, uh, about a synthetic turf
[SPEAKER_02]: versus natural grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an incredibly elaborate
presentation of which the only thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately jumped out worthy of our
discussion here is not all traffic is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know how to quantify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this graph is saying,
but an hour of baseball is different than
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour of field hockey.
[SPEAKER_02]: An hour of softball is different than an
hour of rugby, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the amount of wear and
tear, uh, the fields should be able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, are going to have to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, we think about this,
like with rounds of golf too, a much
[SPEAKER_02]: easier measure, uh, in some ways to
determine, especially with Nikolai's work
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, that we're going to validate
this summer that the majority of the steps
[SPEAKER_02]: on a putting green happened right around
the whole location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know not all traffic is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have all these variables,
Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's this great title of the proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the background is Joe Magliocca's
field down in Elmira city school district.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, exactly the kinds of fields that you
and I sort of have to, we work with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't work at the highest levels where
they have, where money's not an object,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not just about the money,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at this proposal and I'm
putting this up here so everybody else can
[SPEAKER_02]: glaze over at the amount of a logic that's
going into trying to determine how to
[SPEAKER_02]: solve field problems, help communities
answer the question is natural turf or
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic turf a better option?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, navigate the web of
communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, I think Chase really depicts,
uh, the project here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, let's start right here with the
conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We think about footwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think about, uh, field quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already passed the comment,
just give me full grass cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, when we three talk and the people
that might be listening and think,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, how hard is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Ben Palmer puts them on sneakers
in the spring, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: To not put as much wear and tear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so how, why is this so hard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause Carla and I also know how hard this
is, but talk a little bit about navigating
[SPEAKER_02]: something that seems simple, like just get
really good grass cover and should be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to hold up to a certain amount of wear and
tear and getting that executed on many of
[SPEAKER_02]: the communities, uh, throughout the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we paid a big bucks to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it all boils down to funding and
I, and that's going to be related to
[SPEAKER_01]: having some professional sports field
turf, sports turf manager, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: to hire somebody who's knowledgeable in
how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the first step?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, is that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had to boil it down to the key to
making this happen, is it making sure they
[SPEAKER_02]: can attract somebody who knows like they
do what they're doing just like they do
[SPEAKER_02]: for HVAC systems and other systems in
facility operations?
[SPEAKER_02]: How come we can't get it viewed as a trade
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the key, is it the key and how
come?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because you have somebody
knowledgeable on how to, and this is true
[SPEAKER_01]: for synthetic turf maintenance too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have somebody knowledgeable on what it
takes to properly maintain the field
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than somebody who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to be the one who's
getting educated, hopefully attending
[SPEAKER_01]: things like this, keeping up with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to, they're going to be
the resource on, okay, how do we provide
[SPEAKER_01]: the safe, playable fields?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for all fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, um, as I said, you know,
the weather is not so good and we got a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of kids want to play sports and we got
a lot of native soil fields up this neck
[SPEAKER_02]: of the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would say the, uh, uh, frequency of
questions we're getting in New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of New York nationally from
concerned people, not necessarily people
[SPEAKER_02]: in the management business that when would
we deal with regularly, but a different
[SPEAKER_02]: level of sort of advocacy that,
um, they're against synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've sort of turned on synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the preponderance on synthetic turf
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you try to navigate this thing in
your mind, as you see this grant
[SPEAKER_02]: unfolding, what do you think are the keys
that you're going to develop in this grant
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to be important for forming
that decision that even if somebody wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to think about it now, what are some of
the things that are going to come out of
[SPEAKER_02]: this work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think people should be considering
that are keys in that discussion at the
[SPEAKER_02]: community level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think one thing is, you know,
we're, we're turf grass scientists,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The three of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but at the same time we're researchers
and our job is to provide unbiased data to
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders to benefit their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from the, with that perspective,
we have to do a fair assessment on natural
[SPEAKER_01]: grass versus synthetic turf in all aspects
of what we're evaluating in that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so our initial submission
was last year and that was a knock on it
[SPEAKER_01]: as we were to progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first got that comment from a
reviewer that we need to be more unbiased,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is USDA, yada yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of upset about it,
but after sitting on it for a year and
[SPEAKER_01]: having to reformat this, this proposal,
you know, I get now why they want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they can't invest a lot of money when
our initial, we have an initial bias
[SPEAKER_01]: already, uh, that we want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass is going to be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, it was obvious the way that we first
read it, written it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we, we reformatted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've pulled in industry people from all,
from every side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're truly coming at it from a more
unbiased approach and that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're going to have, we're going to
have factual information.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these numbers are going to be
leaning one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, we have people now on board
that's going to help us balance that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's, that was top
priority with the resubmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now within that, I mean, all the
factors that we're trying to consider in
[SPEAKER_01]: the study, I mean, we're looking at
environmental factors, uh, safety,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, costs, obviously, and one field type
will probably be beneficial in one
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario and another field type will be
beneficial in another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to be so cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but nonetheless, we need to provide
unbiased information so that people can
[SPEAKER_01]: make the decisions that's best for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you talk about professional
level fields, um, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a completely different world than
community level fields and all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the various variability and community
level fields is so extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be able to provide large scale,
unbiased information about all field
[SPEAKER_01]: types, covering all components of
community level sports fields is our goal
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they can make the decisions for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not natural grass versus synthetic
turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that they have, they have the
information they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, and here is, you know,
what a extension scientist who doesn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: too much research in this area generally
tells people, especially with a spring
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the amount of kids that want to play,
you got two options.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have natural grass and you got,
you know, 200% normal rainfall,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you better have a lot of extra fields
where you're going to have to sacrifice
[SPEAKER_02]: and move them around to a certain extent,
even if they're built out of sand,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't rotate them or reline them or
move them around, if you get this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: weather, you're going to see significant
damage, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where I'd say, this is a time
where access to some synthetic turf is
[SPEAKER_02]: really valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the summertime, I'd say, I don't want
those kids on that turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: That turf even up here in upstate New York
is going to get really hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevermind what it's going to be down there
in Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's some very simple things
involved here, but what I, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, what do you think too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you've also interacted with these
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sense is you get a lot of project
management people involved in these
[SPEAKER_02]: communities as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to think you,
you know, you got this web of stakeholders
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's always going to be somebody
driving the bus and who's sort of putting
[SPEAKER_02]: down the initial stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're very project
management, engineering oriented,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you, Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're like, how much can I
use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much does it cost me to maintain
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these other things are more like,
okay, well, like we'll figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everything else has to be somewhere
between that, right, Carl?
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that what it boils down to in the
conversations you've started to have with
[SPEAKER_02]: folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a bit of that, but I think
the nuance is lost on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Frank, you just explained synthetic
is great for the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not great for the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of an if then thing that
that's not a zero or one like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, we either need synthetic or we need
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think just a little
bit, we poked around with, with sort of K
[SPEAKER_00]: through 12 facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the last we have to think
about fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can focus on the building and pest
control in the building and education of
[SPEAKER_00]: our students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Chase is saying, really,
you need somebody there who's a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional and knows the day to day and
the week to week and the month to month
[SPEAKER_00]: activities that will vary based on the
season or based on the use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing we got from Chase's
proposal, when you share with us last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, Chase was like, well, we don't
understand who's making decisions at
[SPEAKER_00]: community levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it just a coach who coaches
football and it's just like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mow the fields and then I'll make all
the, you know, like baseball fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize a lot of the baseball
coaches end up mowing those sort of high
[SPEAKER_00]: school level, middle school level fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a baseball coach and probably
have another full-time job, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't even understand who's making
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's really important to
get this work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chase is like, we know the turf stuff that
you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be easy, but all those other
factors, if it's parents, if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: administrators, if it's facility people
who are really focused on HVAC or power
[SPEAKER_00]: generators, getting generators or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just mowing the fields,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the sort of the black box.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is why they go to synthetic turf,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chase, and you said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The assumption is it's no maintenance for
synthetic turf, that I can build it and
[SPEAKER_02]: forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's capital money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not annual operating dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I signed a warranty.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company's going to come for six years
and make sure it's cared for, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it gets at least a
little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the critical point is it's not
no maintenance, especially the infills,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The various amount of infills you can use,
the various sports that move this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's my question, since you're on
the hot seat here today, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be the last time we get you,
but when you sit down, okay, so they said
[SPEAKER_02]: don't be so pro-grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming you reach out to people
involved in synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you that when I've sat in
the same room giving a natural turf talk
[SPEAKER_02]: after a synthetic turf talk, no knock on
the science of synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the guy before me sounded like he was
selling a carpet for your living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The various stitchings and weavings and
logos and things you could get on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I brought up safety, everybody
was like, what's this guy talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, there's something wrong with
synthetic turf?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those people involved in helping
inform the decision, they're looking,
[SPEAKER_02]: even the guys at the school grounds level,
they're looking to influence that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the synthetic turf guys get a little
defensive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they a little squirrely when it comes
to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know the natural turf guys are a
little squirrely about synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the synthetic turf guys equal a little
defensive about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they all are, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They all want to push their product and
they all want to push their initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, the synthetic turf companies
that were really on board from the get go
[SPEAKER_01]: for my initial asks to be a part of this
project are the ones that truly do care
[SPEAKER_01]: about putting out useful information and
unbiased information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've started to internally identify
who those people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they should do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they understand that things might not
benefit them, but they also understand
[SPEAKER_01]: things probably could benefit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to be beneficial to one
specific sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be benefits and
disadvantages of everything that we found
[SPEAKER_02]: in this game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you might as well get used to your
success in this project is likely with
[SPEAKER_02]: both sides feeling a little bit upset with
you, which is a space Carl and I have
[SPEAKER_02]: inhabited for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making up shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, we got any questions from the
audience for Chase or any more from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I have, Chase, is have you
guys thought about like we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the decision making process and
there's going to be a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to just provide the
information for communities or school
[SPEAKER_00]: districts to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thought about including AI in there,
like a decision making tool or software
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just enter a couple of things
like we have this much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these weather conditions on a
given year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts about a tool at the end that
can they can just sort of put stuff in and
[SPEAKER_00]: it spits out a decision for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the end deliverable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's like our big thing that
we're building towards all this data feeds
[SPEAKER_01]: into a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go in with their specific
scenario, their budget, the people they
[SPEAKER_01]: got hours of use, whatever, and just spit
out a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a home run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then every so so basically
what's about to happen is before you close
[SPEAKER_02]: the hood, everybody's going to get a
chance to look under it and have some
[SPEAKER_02]: influence in in what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once the person is it going to be
something that person using the tool is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have to self identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I'm an administrator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grounds manager or it doesn't really
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just have to enter in the logistics
of the district use and money and people
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to identify through earlier
objectives of the project who those
[SPEAKER_01]: decision makers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, anybody can use the tool but
the idea would be to promote it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual to the decision makers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a very contentious issue,
Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we know we like to fight about
everything up here in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for a fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Frank, going back to your point,
though, we don't have data to support a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of our things right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of these arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have data and I'm the guy that has
to be in the middle of the back and forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just be like, look, this isn't my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But well, and that's and I tell you,
as we wrap up, that's probably why I
[SPEAKER_02]: formulated the opinions that I have about
this, because these are the things we have
[SPEAKER_02]: data about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use these synthetic surfaces
pretty consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you manage them, they can take more
events than a natural grass system,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe not by as much as people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some some data about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's data about heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's data about the high
traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get into the cancer thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I don't I don't get into the MERSA
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the MERSA thing, they sort of,
you know, most of the science refutes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some science that says there
are things that live in that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, who the hell knows when you got to
put cork or whatever stupid thing we're
[SPEAKER_02]: about to put in there before we let you
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you as just a sports turf guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: From the old Kentucky days with AJ Powell,
heard about the impact microplastic issues
[SPEAKER_02]: in the EU are going to have on synthetic
turf, as maybe our listeners are thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about what the next generation of
synthetic turf is going to be filled with
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's infilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like second the the second
largest resource next to tires,
[SPEAKER_01]: actual tires in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've identified as microplastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't know to what degree,
though, I haven't read up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature enough to note, is it truly
impactful to, you know, humans or animals
[SPEAKER_01]: or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something it's something that
we're considering in the grant as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we're covering all aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everyone, for coming today live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the Web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
