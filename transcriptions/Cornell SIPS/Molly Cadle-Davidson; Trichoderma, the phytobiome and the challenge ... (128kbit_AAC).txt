[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the invitation to come
down and speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful sunny day in Ithaca,
so I'll try to talk fast so you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: back out there in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is my title.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work for a company that develops
biological seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is fungi and
bacteria that you can coat the seed with,
[SPEAKER_04]: plant it in the ground, and they affect
plant performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the main fungal species that we're
working with is trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what our existing products are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this phytobiomes, microbiome approach
to research is something that is really
[SPEAKER_04]: important in what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you think about it,
what we are leveraging is the phytobiome
[SPEAKER_04]: in our technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a brief outline of my talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize, looking at this,
that I'm only going to partially follow
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are a little out of order,
but you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before I jump right into things,
there are a couple things I want to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about to the students and postdocs in the
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing is careers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you all may think that you know
exactly what you want to do, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really rare that you take that straight
line path and you end up doing what you
[SPEAKER_04]: think you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never thought I would be the chief
science officer at a company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my main method is think creatively and
broadly about what your career options
[SPEAKER_04]: are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing I would say is that
dollars are rare, are few and far between,
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless of the sector of science that
you're in, academics, industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywhere you go, you're going to be
operating on a shoestring, unless you're
[SPEAKER_04]: working in the plant breeding program in
Monsanto, where you can afford to cut out
[SPEAKER_04]: 500,000 plots every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next thing I want to mention is about
communicating science.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that I'm very passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that everyone here should think
about, because you have a lot to
[SPEAKER_04]: communicate about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot to think about in your
careers doing science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them should be how you talk
about your science.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scientists, until fairly recently,
used to be in a position of authority that
[SPEAKER_04]: we were seen as experts in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we worked with facts and things like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's been a change.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to think about how to speak
about science and how to communicate that
[SPEAKER_04]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are just some notes that I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know how to speak about
science, if you're not a good speaker,
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to be able to communicate
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone is going to argue like a
scientist does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have discourse.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not how everyone does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other part about this is don't
just talk to scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can publish in peer-reviewed journals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have really nice conversations at
meetings that we go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are other people out there that
you need to be talking to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are other non-scientists who are
talking about science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bloggers, for example, are going to go
into that peer-reviewed literature as well
[SPEAKER_04]: and mine it for what they're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to learn how to talk to these
people and figure out how to be part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a note about bloggers and things like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: People will question your motivations.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole goal of some people when
they question science is why did you do
[SPEAKER_04]: this research and who's funding it.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the things we need to be
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may rationalize why you're doing
research on a scientific level.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other people are going to find other
reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this I just want to bring up these
points as things we need to be thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: about as future scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of this should be fairly
obviously think creatively about how you
[SPEAKER_04]: make yourself heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the answer to this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not good at Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even figure out how to send a
tweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my generation I suppose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to what people are saying and teach
as often as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work for a company called Advanced
Biological Marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are based in Vanuatu, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: The company was founded in the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our R&D lab is located in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pictured here probably the day after we
moved in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice how nice and clean it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks nothing like that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Gary Harmon who was faculty at Cornell
up in Geneva for 40 plus years was our
[SPEAKER_04]: first chief science officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has since retired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gary Bergstrom asked me what does that
mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well he started writing another LLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway this is where I work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what Advanced Biological
Marketing does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Discovery, development, production and
sales of microbial seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: These microbial seed treatments are
generally referred to in the industry as
[SPEAKER_04]: biological.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I refer to biologicals to a
scientist that means a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my industry it means these living seed
or other types of applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working primarily with trichoderma
but also bacillus and rhizobia because we
[SPEAKER_04]: have products for lots of different legume
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are selling are spores.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the case of more fragile organisms
like the gram negatives we're selling
[SPEAKER_04]: encapsulated cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an important thing because
what we do is we sell a product that is
[SPEAKER_04]: put on the seed might be combined with
agricultural chemicals like fungicides,
[SPEAKER_04]: insecticides, things like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're actually selling is an
important thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how these are used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well they're used by the farmer all the
way up to a commercial seed treater in a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of different environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put this picture in just to show
some of the differences and I'll show you
[SPEAKER_04]: more than just this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was actually a field trial that
was done this year in a drought situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you can kind of see these strips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is typical of some of the kinds
of data that we collect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a strip trial where this very green
strip was the control standard chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was not tasseled yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are a couple of biological
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our treatment actually won this particular
trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see some of the differences
here in the different cobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: These from the standard chemical
treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on your left are cobs that didn't fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're slower maturing as you can
tell by the lighter color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then those on the right were our
product which is called Sabrex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that contains two different strains of
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is matured at this point in the
season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it filled much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again it didn't fill completely because I
said this was under severe drought stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a little bit about the company
and what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are a lot of other players in
this game.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of different pedigrees of
the companies that are also in seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: ag chemicals, and now biologicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was fairly accurate until about a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bayer is now in the process of
acquiring Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that goes through, that's a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dow has, I think, finalized their
merger with DuPont.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Syngenta is no longer just Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually owned by a Chinese company
called Kim China.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are now actually just four
players.
[SPEAKER_04]: BASF, in contrast, looks pretty small
relative to these others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so ABM plays in the same area.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're producing these biologicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of these companies are as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're a teeny tiny fish playing in a
pond with some quite large fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are biologicals?
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, it's this general term.
[SPEAKER_04]: It started out as biological control.
[SPEAKER_04]: The use of one organism to limit the
activity of another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think, when you look in the
literature, most biological control is
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about insects to control insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're using fungi and bacteria as seed
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can control insects, nematodes,
fungal and bacterial pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several models about how this
might work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get to that in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has obvious potential for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just think about disease control,
well, that's one thing that, obviously,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm speaking to the plant pathology
department.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to control disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are a lot of other things that
happen, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that you can get with most any
biological is growth promotion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see plants grow bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: They often look greener because the genes
involved in photosynthesis are
[SPEAKER_04]: upregulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see increased yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that benefit is fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then, if you can apply a safe
biological product to the seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: or even as a foliar spray, or along with
the fertilizer, maybe you can reduce the
[SPEAKER_04]: need for agricultural chemicals,
which should be good, which, in turn,
[SPEAKER_04]: should lead to healthier and safer
agricultural systems, more sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So biologicals have been around,
or biological control has been around for
[SPEAKER_04]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first registered fungal biocontrol was
T22.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was done by Gary Harmon in 1990,
when it was registered.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had clear demonstrations of this
performance enhancement in the field and
[SPEAKER_04]: disease control in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the people are, there are a
lot of products that were developed at
[SPEAKER_04]: that time and since for biocontrol and as
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes this whole industry was its
own worst enemy because there wasn't a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was poorly understood.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were brewing these things in their
mom's basement and selling dirty water,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened in the early days that is
still biting us in the butt now,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully I'll show you how we're
moving beyond that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are several control mechanisms
that were hypothesized at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from your intro path course,
hopefully you know some of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Antibiosis, where an organism might
produce a chemical or metabolite that is
[SPEAKER_04]: toxic or inhibitory to another organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Niche replacement, where something,
really, one organism outcompetes another
[SPEAKER_04]: and a direct antagonism, which,
did I show that on the previous slide?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where an organism might actually kill
another organism, not necessarily through
[SPEAKER_04]: an anabiosis method.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then performance enhancement
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the main mechanisms that's
hypothesized is nutrient mobilization or
[SPEAKER_04]: bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also through growth promotion,
you get with that increased root surface
[SPEAKER_04]: area, which has obvious benefits in terms
of water and nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of where we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem was the field performance
has been highly variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said, some of that came to do
with how some of these products were
[SPEAKER_04]: developed and produced in the early days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what everyone in this field is
trying to overcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on, what we know now is that the
mechanisms for disease control do include
[SPEAKER_04]: this niche replacement, anabiosis,
and mycoparasitism.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, there have been a lot of studies
from Dr. Harmon's lab, as well as many
[SPEAKER_04]: others around the world, showing that
there are many genes that are actually
[SPEAKER_04]: turned on when the plant is colonized by
some of these biological agents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we get an induced systemic
resistance of many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Abiotic stress resistance, we see that the
changes in plant gene expression due to
[SPEAKER_04]: this colonization have a really big effect
on reactive oxygen cycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, reactive oxygen species,
as we know, are stress molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the roots are colonized by
trichoderma specifically, the genes that
[SPEAKER_04]: in this cycling pathway are upregulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plant is better able to buffer
stress, to protect itself against stress,
[SPEAKER_04]: and protect its proteins and cell
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So growth promotion, bio-stimulation,
we know that, yes, soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: availability is important here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also see that the changes in plant
gene expression upregulate carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolism and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're seeing here is that the
hypotheses from the early days weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's more to it than that,
that the organisms are actually directly
[SPEAKER_04]: affecting how the plant is expressing its
own genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to give a few examples just
in pictures here of some of the effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is an experiment that we do in
the greenhouse for disease control.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one of many different types.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously, we can test for
anabiosis on a plate or in the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we care most about is testing
these things in the soil and better yet,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a greenhouse experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we've done here is we've infested
the soil to an LD50.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is with rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we plant 10 wheat seeds in
there, we expect to kill five of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the assay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've done a good job of that right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of the rest of these were treated
with the standard chemical treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that standard chemical treatment
is a mixture of fungicides and
[SPEAKER_04]: insecticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just depends on who you buy it from
as to exactly what those are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a standard chemical treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see that it actually has three
fungicides in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's controlling the rhizoctonia
better than the control.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you throw trichoderma in that
mix, then you see either with the standard
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical treatment or trichoderma alone,
we see a really big improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we have 100% germination in the
trichoderma shown here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one way we do this assay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might say, oh, but you put a
fungicide on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is trichoderma, which is a fungus,
able to grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, trichoderma, first of all,
we put on spores, which are very
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is trichoderma is
actually broadly resistant to fungicides,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is one of the key reasons why we use
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a disease test.
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at abiotic stress tolerance,
these are some plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we've either applied a water deficit
to, and we did that just by determining
[SPEAKER_04]: what the 100% water holding capacity was
on that pot, weighed it, and then watered
[SPEAKER_04]: to 60% of that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's our water stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Salt stress is we're watering with a salt
solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants on the left did not have
trichoderma on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants on the right do have
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these pictures, I know it's just one
plant, but it's a demonstration of the
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of effect that you can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said earlier, we want this to be
able to translate to the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we do a lot of work in the
greenhouse, but as fast as we can,
[SPEAKER_04]: we move our pipeline products out to the
field so we can get some real world data
[SPEAKER_04]: on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was an entire field that was
split down the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half was planted with no trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other half was planted with
trichoderma, which is, in this case,
[SPEAKER_04]: was our Sabrex for corn product,
curing two trichoderma strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: That treatment was made at the time of
planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of these were also coated with
the standard chemical treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they received the same base treatment
the plants on the right received,
[SPEAKER_04]: our Sabrex for corn trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Illinois, in 2012, there was a severe
drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see the result.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trichoderma enabled the plants on the
right to continue to live, to produce a
[SPEAKER_04]: yield, which you can see in the cobs
below.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't perfect ear filling down here,
but it was far better than the untreated
[SPEAKER_04]: plants on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants on the left, we don't have
yield data on, or what the yield
[SPEAKER_04]: improvement was on this, because the
material on the left was not harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just 2-4.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, looking at growth
promotion, as I said, this is the trait
[SPEAKER_04]: that is most commonly affected by a
biological product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may or may not control disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may or may not improve abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will, like 95% of the time,
give you a bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have a Sabrex product here for
rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is showing standard chemical
treatment alone on the left and Sabrex for
[SPEAKER_04]: rice over that standard chemical control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the larger root mass
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the same number of plants in
each pile there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you, this is the kind of data I
receive sometimes from the field guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not always the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a pretty good representation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The corn in the middle, we're looking at
the control plant on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, everything received the standard
chemical treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sabrex for corn is in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the K5AS2 on the right is one of our
pipeline products, which is bigger still.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these, again, are shown in the roots
on the right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: At ABN, we talk a lot about improvements
in root biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a really hard thing to measure
unless you have a risotron.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we made up our own risotron.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a 7-foot PVC pipe that we put
into the ground and we fill with soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what we did with these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we treated them with our treatments,
the standard chemical treatment plus the
[SPEAKER_04]: treatments that are listed up there on the
top, and let them grow through the season,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then pulled those tubes out of the
ground and washed away the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what is shown here is the control
Sabrex and then two pipeline products with
[SPEAKER_04]: a much bigger root mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so K5AS2, the pipeline product,
and then Omega, which interestingly
[SPEAKER_04]: contains no living biological,
contains only a metabolite or signaling
[SPEAKER_04]: molecule from trichoderma that is
formulated here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is really interesting because,
again, we harvested this at the end of the
[SPEAKER_04]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we got here was a season-long
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we're still working out,
how that's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, so these are some of the growth
promotion data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: This wasn't quantitative data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to give you the idea because
you're probably not used to looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's move on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been talking about our
products, our products and our pipeline
[SPEAKER_04]: products, which are two strains,
sometimes more, but usually the sweet spot
[SPEAKER_04]: is two to four organisms in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I told you I'd talk about the
phytobiome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why do we care about the phytobiome?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are a lot of reasons why you
might care about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'm telling you that we're
putting a biological product, we're
[SPEAKER_04]: putting biological organisms on the seed
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that a corn plant, for example,
it's got endophytes living in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have organisms on the leaf
tissue as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these are causing disease,
some are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil is teeming with life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're putting on another living
organism onto the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wouldn't we care about the phytobiome?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually what we're doing and what
we're leveraging in our products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just we didn't know it until about
five years ago because it didn't have a
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things that we think about
all the time is what are we recruiting to
[SPEAKER_04]: the seed when we put our biological there?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is all in the realm of
phytobiome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to give a plug here that
APS, our professional society,
[SPEAKER_04]: is very heavily involved in phytobiomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to learn more about it,
if you're not fully into that,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can learn more here, find the
roadmap that's been put together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've probably seen slides like this
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just went to Web of Science and looked
how many times has the term microbiome or
[SPEAKER_04]: phytobiome been used over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's been a massive increase
actually since 2008, 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not to say people weren't
thinking about this before then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what's happened is that
sequencing and informatic techniques have
[SPEAKER_04]: really come along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we can acquire so much sequence now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can, you know, you know, back in the
day, people and I, sorry, I said back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day, but you know, a long time ago,
you know, people were doing PCR on dirt
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're like, why are you doing PCR on
dirt?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what are you going to get out of
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is what we can get out of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can now look at this with Illumina
Sequence or some other kind of sequencing
[SPEAKER_04]: technologies and we can actually figure
out a lot about what's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been a real boom here and a lot
of this has been in medicine, but more and
[SPEAKER_04]: more is in the plant world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is something that's changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with this, along with the scientific
discoveries and the Illumina, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sequencing and bioinformatics
technologies that have been on the rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been an explosion in ag-biological
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: ABM has been working in this area since
2000, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the companies, and I know
I'm missing, I'm sure I'm missing a lot,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just some ones I could think of
the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I already told you about the,
sorry, the big players in the field,
[SPEAKER_04]: Monsanto and Bayer, now one, Pioneer,
Dow, I mean, DuPont, Dow are now one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the ones who have been around
for a while and are traditional chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: companies and plant breeding companies
that are now in biologicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones in blue are also companies that
are a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of on the fringes,
kind of second-tier chemical companies or
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding companies that are also playing
in this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of those that are in green,
and these are the ones that I know that
[SPEAKER_04]: there are many more of, are the companies
that have been started or started working
[SPEAKER_04]: in biologicals in the last five years,
specifically to leverage phytobiome and
[SPEAKER_04]: microbiome data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all new.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is showing you kind of the
market or the space that ABM is operating
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every one of these companies is trying
to address something that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: fundamental problem in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: That agriculture suffers from the effects
of environmental variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no question about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we do breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we do trialing all over the
country in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to address this problem
because if we could get 300 bushel corn
[SPEAKER_04]: every single year, everywhere we planted,
well, that's done and I'd be out of a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not how it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of environmental
variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a plot of some of our data I
think just from last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's showing yields on the y-axis and
location on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are probably about five corn hybrids
that are in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not all one genotype of the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's showing you that yields vary by
location.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's in blue here is our Sabrex for
corn product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, a trichoderma product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's increased over the control or under
the control.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the case may be for down there on the
left down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what this shows very clearly is that
there's no relationship between the
[SPEAKER_04]: performance of a biological and the yield
of a corn plant or even the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so why is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the answer, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's one of the things that we are
working on trying to solve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is everyone else that I showed on
that last slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone is working on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting back to phytobiomes, can some of
this field level variability be explained
[SPEAKER_04]: by its interaction with the phytobiome?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of factors out there,
but we need to think about what the
[SPEAKER_04]: factors are that we can control and
understand, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ag biologicals interact with rhizosphere
and soil inhabitants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant endosphere and the phylosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where that corn plant has to live
or whatever crop that you work on or
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it has to live with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an equation that everyone in
here should know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't, then you should come to
love this because you can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: mileage out of this, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So phenotype, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genotype we think about as being the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The host.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you plant it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What chemicals did you apply to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much rain did you get that year?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other part, the G by E.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do the genetics of that host interact
with the environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if this term is really big,
then you need to go back to doing some
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding and rethinking this because this
is the part that we really want to control
[SPEAKER_04]: is that genetic by environmental
interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is the rest of the slide
because what I want to talk about is what
[SPEAKER_04]: can we control here and what can't we
control?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's phenotype, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're interested in the plant
looking like at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genotype we've thought of as being the
host.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's another genotype here that
people are starting to add.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the biological product,
the microbial, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Monsanto, Pioneer, all these
companies, ABM, all of us who are
[SPEAKER_04]: developing microbes, we all have the
genome sequences of restraints.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know what the genotypes are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what a lot of research is aimed at
is how does that microbe interact with the
[SPEAKER_04]: host plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the phytobiome research comes into
is how does this interaction relate to
[SPEAKER_04]: this interaction, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all of this on the end here,
that's the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already talked about weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no controlling the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: Management practices, you may think you
control management practices, but when you
[SPEAKER_04]: send your material out to a contract
researcher and you say, I would like you
[SPEAKER_04]: to apply 200 pounds of nitrogen and they
apply free and they'll tell you about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, that's something that, you know,
it's hard to control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can make recommendations,
but in the end, the farmer is going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: what the farmer is going to do because
they know their own farm the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil type and environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't control that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rhizosphere biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in the bulk soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in that rhizosphere, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put this with this kind of green and
yellow dot here is because I think where
[SPEAKER_04]: we could be going with this phytobiome
research is gaining some control or at
[SPEAKER_04]: least understanding of what is in the
rhizosphere, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The rhizosphere is going to be different
from what's in the bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you put a biological on the seed
and it's recruiting something or having an
[SPEAKER_04]: antibiotic effect or something,
it's changing what would otherwise be in
[SPEAKER_04]: that rhizosphere, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we make this a predictable
relationship?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where all this is going and that's
what everyone is doing who's playing in
[SPEAKER_04]: this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right, then moving on about how we
do the, and this is the part where my talk
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't really follow the outline that I
put up in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how we develop strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a small company.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are about 40 employees in ABM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to use our resources wisely.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a correlation matrix among a lot
of different traits that I've assayed for
[SPEAKER_04]: in the greenhouse or in the lab or in
field trials with a large set of our
[SPEAKER_04]: strain collection and that's trichoderma
and bacillus, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we want to see is if I can develop
assays that are essentially markers for
[SPEAKER_04]: good performance, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to have to do every single
one of these tests every single time I
[SPEAKER_04]: develop a trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to do a few of these
assays and have that translate to the
[SPEAKER_04]: field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how we do our, well,
the beginnings of our strain selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then once everything gets out into the
field for field trials, well, all bets can
[SPEAKER_04]: be off sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, the point is there are a lot of
different phenotypes that go into a good
[SPEAKER_04]: strain and this very is at a strain level,
not at a species level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that you all are aware of that
and this correlation of phenotypic effects
[SPEAKER_04]: is what's going to get us our high
influence strains and those are the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that we advance through our process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just to give you an idea of what
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to streamline how we can
select for traits and then we advance
[SPEAKER_04]: things to the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an example because we have
field trials every year, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2016, in 2015 is when the phytobiomes
groups started really getting going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought in 2016 in our field trials,
this is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do some sampling of our
rhizosphere and we had actually planned to
[SPEAKER_04]: do some phylosphere as well, but well,
ran out of time and resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we set up a really nice trial in the
field in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: We applied seed treatments in the spring
when we planted this and this is silage
[SPEAKER_04]: corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had four different biological
treatments, six corn hybrids and four
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen levels because we're testing
environmental variability, management
[SPEAKER_04]: practices, things like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had three reps there, which is
fairly typical in a lot of field trials,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially of this size.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and we had a randomized complete block.
[SPEAKER_04]: Design.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our yield results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, this is silage, so it's tons
per acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: And experimental one, there's actually
that K5AS2 that I had shown previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had significant differences among
our treatments there in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just one note is kind of owing to the
variability that we see in the field,
[SPEAKER_04]: often when we analyze data, we use an
alpha point one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, that's how this was
analyzed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha point one, not point oh five,
which would be more typical of a lab kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did this and I'm going to go a
little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'd get you guys out early.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we implemented a process,
which is to study the rhizosphere of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we collected samples, root at
rhizosphere samples in the field,
[SPEAKER_04]: isolated DNA, so we could look at 16S and
ITS, right, because we're working with
[SPEAKER_04]: fungal products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to make sure that we assay the
fungi that are present.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are leveraging the Oxford Nanopore
technology, the MinION, because this is a
[SPEAKER_04]: technology that has a good price point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can bring it in house and we don't have
to wait in line to get our sequencing done
[SPEAKER_04]: wherever we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we decide we want to put something
on the sequencer that day, it takes an
[SPEAKER_04]: hour and a half to make the library and we
can get it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and that time is coming down to 10
minutes FYI.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and then we do the sequencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's all the downstream,
which is the sequence analysis,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think I can skip over at this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a brief word about the MinION
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not familiar with it,
this is a really neat technology that I
[SPEAKER_04]: guess Peter Schweitzer is going to get at
the core facility here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have reads, like the power users
have reported reads up to two megabases
[SPEAKER_04]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a single read compared to Illumina,
which is one to 300, depending on what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the error rates are much higher than
Illumina.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're thinking about sequence
length versus depth, then that's something
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: This technology is fieldable.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we wanted to, which we don't,
we could take this to the field actually
[SPEAKER_04]: and run it off the laptop in the back of
the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're continually improving this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This error rate has actually dropped quite
a bit over the last year just because of
[SPEAKER_04]: technological changes with that
instrument.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a really nice technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also leads to some challenges for
us because we're getting far fewer reads
[SPEAKER_04]: than you would for Illumina and we have a
higher error rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do get longer reads than Illumina,
which means that we can look at longer
[SPEAKER_04]: sequences in terms of ITS.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look at the whole ITS reads.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look at the entire region if we
want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other negative we have is that
we're interested in looking at fungal
[SPEAKER_04]: communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why that's important is because a lot
of the software development for analyzing
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these things is for 16S,
is for bacterial genomes, not fungal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other negative is I'm our
bioinformaticist and I'm kind of having to
[SPEAKER_04]: come up to speed in some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at CHIME, there's a really
clear, so okay, for those of you who are
[SPEAKER_04]: not working in this area, CHIME is a
software, and actually now there's CHIME
[SPEAKER_04]: too, which allows you to look at these
kind of metagenomic microbiome type of
[SPEAKER_04]: data and ultimately find where the
differences are, identify what is in your
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA sample, and then find out a little bit
about either well, it doesn't tell you
[SPEAKER_04]: function, but you can really interrogate
what some of those different organisms
[SPEAKER_04]: are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is fine to use if you're
working on 16S and if you have really high
[SPEAKER_04]: read numbers, like with Illumina,
but if you're working with min-ion data,
[SPEAKER_04]: as we are, sadly the lower read number and
the higher error rate means that CHIME
[SPEAKER_04]: kicks out most of our reads and we're
unable to make it all the way through the
[SPEAKER_04]: pipeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: With more than about nine features.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our pipeline is we generate the data
and we use the Oxford Nanopore technology
[SPEAKER_04]: software to do the base calling and
quality filtering, and then a BLAST Plus
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis and a script-based manipulation
of the BLAST output, which in all honesty
[SPEAKER_04]: is where we need to be because having the
CHIME analysis looking at reams and ream
[SPEAKER_04]: of data for 16S isn't necessarily going to
get me closer to developing a new product.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to understand is a little bit
higher level than that where I don't need
[SPEAKER_04]: to know all the different strains that are
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I need to actually do in the end is
find what the function of that rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: is, and there are definitely tools out
there to do that, but in terms of being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to go this far as we are,
this is actually what I need to be doing
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to quickly run through massive
amounts of data, this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sampled that cornfield in 2016 and we
determined a core microbiome by filtering
[SPEAKER_04]: based on bit score.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I was looking at BLAST output
and co-occurrence in all three reps.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lot of data loss and what I'm
showing you here is a 16S results.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up with the core microbiome that
was fairly small.
[SPEAKER_04]: C is the control, O is omega.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, that contains no living
biological, it's just the metabolite.
[SPEAKER_04]: K is K5-AS2 and S is our Sabrex for corn
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the four different treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the result.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each line in this graph represents an
organism and you're not expected to read
[SPEAKER_04]: the y-axis because most of those are
uncultured.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were just too many of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each line represents one organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color of that line tells me if that
organism is represented in one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: treatments or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, these bars down at the bottom
have the control, Sabrex, K5-AS2,
[SPEAKER_04]: and omega in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: All four colors are represented.
[SPEAKER_04]: These organisms are found in all of the
samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is that these are
organisms that are found only in the
[SPEAKER_04]: control and then these organisms up here
are found only in either the Sabrex omega
[SPEAKER_04]: or K5-AS2 or some combination of our
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 16S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then here's a similar, although less
organized representation of what we found
[SPEAKER_04]: in, sorry, did I say 16S?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was 16S.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is ITS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar representation of what we found
for the ITS community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, there were several genera.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on a genus level that these are
listed here that were present in all
[SPEAKER_04]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some that were in most of the treatments,
but there are some that are present only
[SPEAKER_04]: in the control, only in Sabrex,
only in K5-AS2, and only in omega.
[SPEAKER_04]: What this is telling us is that we saw
changes in the rhizosphere community that
[SPEAKER_04]: were correlated with treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a replicated study.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel pretty good about this because
really we just wanted to see, are we
[SPEAKER_04]: moving that rhizosphere community away
from what it is as a control?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have the ability to change it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it gets to mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are our organisms doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they only have an effect on plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I told you at the outset that
trichoderma changes plant gene expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all they're doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are producing metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: That top bar up there is omega.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a metabolite produced by
trichoderma that we've applied to the
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are our organisms communicating with the
other microbes in the soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it changing how the plant communicates
with the organisms in the soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: What this does is get a lot more
questions, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another way of looking at the ITS
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just did this yesterday because,
as I said, the thing we really want to do
[SPEAKER_04]: is look at the change in function of the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we changing anything functionally
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just classified the output from the ITS
analysis into different lifestyles or
[SPEAKER_04]: functions there in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are very, very general.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you can see is, and it's based on the
genus level.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, that first blue category
there, beneficial pathogen, that means in
[SPEAKER_04]: that genus, we find both beneficial and
pathogenic organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real mix and you can't really say,
oh, it's mostly this or that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see in the control, mostly a mix,
but what's notable about this is that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's more diversity in the control
treatment than in the SABREX omega or
[SPEAKER_04]: K5AS2, which is interesting because we
think about ag chemistry as being
[SPEAKER_04]: something that reduces diversity in our
crops, reduces soil diversity,
[SPEAKER_04]: reduces the foliar phylospheric community,
reduces that diversity, and we think of
[SPEAKER_04]: that as being potentially bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we want to get rid of the pathogens,
but we don't want to get rid of everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing a reduction in diversity here was
interesting to me because this is not that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the same thing as what chemicals do,
but it's still a reduction in diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other fascinating thing here is a real
increase in what I called pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I called things pathogen based on
their genus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, there are a lot of things like,
for example, in pusarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are pathogens there and there are
things that are not pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've really done is just change this
distribution, but it definitely argues
[SPEAKER_04]: against a niche replacement model here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This analysis, as with all the other
analyses that I've just shown you,
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets more questions than it does
answers, but it really makes us start
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about what our products and what
a biological might contribute to ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I would like to turn over if
there's any time for questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: but my summary is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're assembling strain consortia that
have an effect and a beneficial effect on
[SPEAKER_04]: crop production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what's going to be really valuable
going forward is assembling very large
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypic data sets and I think probably
everyone in this room here knows that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's where the bottleneck is in making
progress with all the sequence data is we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to have the phenotypic data that goes
right along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then this is my teeny tiny little
conclusion from what we did in the 2016
[SPEAKER_04]: trial is that our seed treatments that we
used in that corn trial appear to
[SPEAKER_04]: influence the rhizosphere community
membership.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about all I can say.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, if there's any time for
questions, I'd be happy to take some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you've done any studies
on what happens long-term if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: treating a field with something over and
over and over, even if it's just on the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean a biological product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that we're initiating
now, but I know that Dr. Harmon has done
[SPEAKER_04]: that where applying something on a winter
rye, so planting it in the fall and then
[SPEAKER_04]: planting back in in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he did this with raspberries and
showing that where the rye had been
[SPEAKER_04]: inoculated in the fall, then they had more
trichoderma on the raspberries when they
[SPEAKER_04]: planted them that spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have lots of data on winter wheat,
which is planted in the fall and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: see it in the spring again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, when we think about perennial
crops or something like this, our
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendation is to treat every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, we're coming to a company,
we want to sell it, but those are data
[SPEAKER_04]: that we are still in the process of
acquiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that there was an effect of
trichoderma on gene expression in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, what is the magnitude of that
change in gene expression and then do you
[SPEAKER_01]: see a similar type of gene expression done
in different environments with that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular model?
[SPEAKER_04]: To the environment question first,
we haven't tested it in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: environments, but a lot of different
people around the world have and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: mainly greenhouse environment is where
that's being tested and so it is something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's reproducible seen over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnitude, they are significant and I'm
just trying to, you know, I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: statistically significant and I'm afraid I
don't have the specifics on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, tens, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, number of genes or magnitude of
change?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hundreds, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you have a very
challenging problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems, if I understand you correctly,
that the phyto biome varies from field to
[SPEAKER_00]: field, just to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're trying to do is to change
it to make it more favorable for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you try to match the organisms that
are contributing to the particular field
[SPEAKER_00]: and once you do that, in one year you
change the phyto biome and presumably if
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep doing that year after year,
then you have the perfect phyto biome and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out of business for that particular
preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that, well, okay, so first of
all, this is something that's in its
[SPEAKER_04]: infancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we actually shift the microbial
community in a given field over time such
[SPEAKER_04]: that it becomes a generally agriculturally
conducive field?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that remains to be seen,
you know, and I think that there should be
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more work on organic soils and
things like this, but have all the
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial communities been characterized
there and it's a problem of environments,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, because every field is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how do we assay every single one of
these fields to determine the ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: get the ability to make a global shift,
to say that, okay, what you need to do in
[SPEAKER_04]: this field is apply this product year over
year over year and then move this into
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's a preferred microbial
community and so then it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So am I worried about, you know,
putting us out of business because if
[SPEAKER_04]: people start using our products,
then they're just going to improve their
[SPEAKER_04]: soils and that'll be that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's all a long way off,
and I mean, that's a long way off before
[SPEAKER_04]: we can say all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that happens is weather,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a hot dry year, even though
you've done all this work to try and
[SPEAKER_04]: improve your soils, you could kill it
right there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You could change everything in a single
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So or you have a disease come through or
an insect or something like this that
[SPEAKER_04]: brings another microbe, you know,
changes the chemistry of the plant that's
[SPEAKER_04]: actually in that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you're planting plants in here,
too, and that has influence as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not worried about my job security
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other reasons why I might worry
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I think that figuring all
this out is going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be wrong, but because it's a systems
biology problem that also has weather,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weather, it's soil environment,
it's everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are human factors as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, once we let all the data
scientists just be in charge of
[SPEAKER_04]: everything, then we'll probably be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we're a long way from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions in Geneva or other
locations?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Molly.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
