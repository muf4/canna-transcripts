[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, thanks so much for having me and
for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alistair Hayden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently an assistant professor of
practice at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before this, I was a division chief in
the California Governor's Office of
[SPEAKER_01]: Emergency Services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here to talk a little bit about some
more disaster-flavored One Health items.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to be about wildfire
smoke and how we can protect ourselves in
[SPEAKER_01]: our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a quick shout out, I love working
with our extension colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll highlight Adam Hughes,
the last name on the list here,
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of our extension colleagues who
we've been doing a lot of work on wildfire
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here to support if you have any
questions or want to talk through wildfire
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke or disasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've been staring at this picture
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably have a guess what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in case not, I'll just start labeling
things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some wildfire smoke plumes up
there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we've got a smoke
plume covering New York State and the
[SPEAKER_01]: region here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a satellite image on June
6, 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first really, really smoky day of
that smoke wave we experienced a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wildfires are kind of a quintessential One
Health issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they burn through vegetation and then,
of course, anything else that's in their
[SPEAKER_01]: path.
[SPEAKER_01]: But healthy ecosystems actually usually
need some amount of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's most famously true out west in
the California ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are ecosystems in our biomes out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pine Barrens ecosystem is the most
famous one that needs lots of wildfire,
[SPEAKER_01]: both here in New York and New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even some of the hardwood ecosystems
do need fire just way, way less
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in an era where wildfires are
really exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a figure from a recent
publication that kind of shows the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the y-axis is the amount of... It's a
schematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not actual data, but it represents
actual data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the y-axis is showing the average acres
burned each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the x-axis is showing us time
over the last several hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that in the present,
there is starting to be an uptick in the
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage burned by wildfires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is because our ecosystems are
getting out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're no longer healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one reason for this is climate
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a bunch of comments in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's not things I need to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So climate change is one of the reasons,
but there are several other reasons that
[SPEAKER_01]: are commonly referenced by folks who study
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have more people moving into high
risk areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 80% of wildfires in the US are
actually started by humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that's intentional, but most
usually that's unintentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be something as simple as parking a
hot car on dry grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wildfires start for all sorts of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a really big one that's shown on
this graph is fire suppression policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually our policies since the late
1800s have been to put out wildfires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, ecosystems need those wildfires
and so by suppressing them, we are causing
[SPEAKER_01]: the ecosystems to be unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that is leading to this increase
that now we're seeing in the frequency and
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity of fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a classic one health
issue because there's a feedback between
[SPEAKER_01]: human and ecosystem health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just wanna say the future will be
smokier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why we wanna talk about
wildfires as a public health emergency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you probably have personally
experienced, I assume most people at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point have lived through a smoke plume
regardless of where it is that you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might've experienced some of these
annoying, irritating symptoms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with wildfire smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wildfire smoke can actually exacerbate
more serious health conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So asthma can be associated with
cardiovascular disease and infectious
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see increases in emergency room
visits and actually mortality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is during wildfire smoke waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's additional health impacts in
the long term that are still only just
[SPEAKER_01]: being studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these health impacts are all things
that can happen while the smoke is still
[SPEAKER_01]: in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I really wanna focus on today is
how to, because you all work with
[SPEAKER_01]: communities, your frontline worker is
important for getting information to your
[SPEAKER_01]: local communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna share with you what I understand
to be some of the best practices for
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting from wildfire smoke in case you
get a question about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically boils down to three things,
getting good data and then knowing how to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect yourself and protect your
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best way to get data and the only
way we recommend is through this wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: website, fire.airnow.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this basically shows air quality for
the whole United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got some extra data that makes it
most useful for tracking wildfires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wildfire smoke plumes and they keep
changing the formatting and it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: federal data site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how long it remains active.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get all the data, what I recommend
you do is click the gear in the upper
[SPEAKER_01]: right corner and that'll let you turn on
some additional data layers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: currently hidden by default.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I usually just go in and turn
everything on cause I'm a big old nerd and
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna see all the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one I was showing was a less
smoky day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a smokier day and I'm showing New
York State here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big circles are official EPA monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are really serious air quality
monitoring stations that are established
[SPEAKER_01]: by the federal EPA, as well as its state,
local and tribal partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are actually defining your
official EPA air quality for your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see across New York State,
there's only something like 15 of those
[SPEAKER_01]: big official monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we have the smaller dots and this
is why I like turning on all the layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are independent sensors,
kind of community science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are things that anyone can go out
and purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk a little bit more about them
in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lower quality data than the
official ones, but they can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful for figuring out, for example,
where the edges of a smoke plume are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the gray areas are smoke plumes
and these are observed by satellites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little hard to see here cause
this picture is all in a smoke plume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just back up one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on this map, you can see that there's
a gray smoke plume covering part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smoke plumes, it's not necessarily
smoke at ground level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a mile above you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because there's a plume overhead
doesn't mean you're breathing the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about these commercial sensors,
we worked with our state cooperative
[SPEAKER_01]: extension here, local health departments
and one tribal nation to distribute some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these commercial sensors to some of the
rural areas that were further from
[SPEAKER_01]: established sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on promoting health
statewide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we noticed that there were gaps,
especially in the rural areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what this ugly yellow shading is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really need a better figure for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we provided sensors to our partners
and then also some training and assistance
[SPEAKER_01]: on installation and using the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case you're interested in these,
the ones we use were purple layer sensors,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are about $300.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a grant to fund this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we chose them was because
these sensors, once you set them up,
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually send data to that official
federal website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these small dots that you're seeing
on the official federal website are data
[SPEAKER_01]: from these community established sensor
stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are working on getting more
companies, air quality monitors,
[SPEAKER_01]: able to feed into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not trying to just promote one company
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the one that I have
familiarity with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw recently that there's another
company called Clarity who now their
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors also feed to the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I wanna really focus on
different data sources for making
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions about air quality, because this
is one of the primary questions that we
[SPEAKER_01]: get during a smoke wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many sources of data out
there and they can say conflicting things
[SPEAKER_01]: and lead to a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only official air quality data
comes from airnow.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go there, you'll see a little
dial like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, again, a federal website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pulling the data from those
official federal monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's showing a couple of things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first is, first I'll point to is at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today's AQI is a 24 hour average AQI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to note that this is a
24 hour average because that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily let you know what is going on
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, there could be really,
really bad air quality while you're asleep
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you wake up and then the air is
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then that average over the 24 hours
could look really, really bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: but your experience was actually while I
was outside walking the dog, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at 24 hour average
AQI, what we are recommending for
[SPEAKER_01]: decision-making based on that is
especially decisions that might occur over
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see they've got tomorrow's
forecast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're thinking about,
should I change or modify my summer camp
[SPEAKER_01]: or activities for my outdoor activities
for tomorrow, the 24 hour AQI is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's official high quality data,
but it doesn't reflect what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing you'll see on this dial
is what they're calling the now cast AQI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the dial part of this,
the good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is really to give you more
information about what your air quality is
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's if you're asking questions
about like, should I go walk the dog right
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the data that you should be using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's less appropriate for the
decisions about tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, good for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then both of these are good because
they're official data, but they come from
[SPEAKER_01]: monitors that might not be that close to
your location, especially if you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: rural area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the other place to get data from
are these commercial sensors, which you
[SPEAKER_01]: can view through that map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you get these sensors, usually they
come with their own data readout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are great for checking local
air quality trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, for example, yourself observe,
oh, it was really bad an hour ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seems to be getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe right now is when I should pop
out and take the dog for a walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I really want to warn
against with these commercial sensors is
[SPEAKER_01]: they are less accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the numbers that they actually
report out, especially during a smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: wave, can be off by a huge factor,
like a factor of five or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might observe that your readout
is going to say something different than
[SPEAKER_01]: the official data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that's because your sensor
just doesn't have the same level of
[SPEAKER_01]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in really bad air quality as
the official data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only recommend those for trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: The really good decision making should
come from the official data sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to connect this back to the fire
and smoke map, I'm sorry, it's small on
[SPEAKER_01]: the right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the now cast AQI is going to show up
as the big dots on the fire and smoke map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the commercial sensors are going to
show up as the small dots on that fire and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke map.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so once you have the data about
your air quality, the next question is
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you actually do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we recommend using air cleaners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know they're very expensive and can
be sometimes hard to find or purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one thing that I recommend and that
I do, I do this personally, is you can
[SPEAKER_01]: make a very, like it's very easy to make,
doesn't require any skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically just duct tape a furnace
filter to a box fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can build this air cleaner for
something like 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you replace the air filters as
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're really effective, they're
really safe, they've been tested and they
[SPEAKER_01]: work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for yourself and your family and
an indoor space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also really important to
look out for your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is also, air quality can be
communicated through these colored flag
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are basically the same colors as
used in that AQI, but it's to communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do with your outdoor activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're making decisions about
these, it's important to remember that
[SPEAKER_01]: people might not have access to clean air
at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get a lot of questions about,
should we cancel school?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we cancel this activity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the recommendation is, actually in
some cases, the facility that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: might actually be able to provide cleaner
air for your occupants than people's home
[SPEAKER_01]: locations if they even do have a indoor
home location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to think about all
members of your community when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making these decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot more information about
this on a website that we put together
[SPEAKER_01]: with some of the questions that we get
frequently asked during wildfire smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, thank you so much for all
your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your attention and showing
up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's my email in the chat if you
want to reach out to ask anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, yeah, when the smoke wave
hits, feel free to forget about me until
[SPEAKER_01]: then, but send us an email if you have
questions when the next smoke wave
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to field questions now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alistair, thinking on the other end of the
spectrum, as somebody who's thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to help us when we have a smoke event,
you're obviously, you must be also talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with people who are thinking about how to
manage forest to mitigate the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like your top three either
colleagues that you like or mitigation
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies for forest management to reduce
fire hazards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so with the fire hazard
specifically, there's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: two-pronged answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone I talk to who's in this space,
basically, we are just so far behind on,
[SPEAKER_01]: they literally call it a fire debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so far behind on the amount of fire
that needs to happen in these landscapes
[SPEAKER_01]: that we just need more people working in
the prescribed burn space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a way of conducting these,
basically simulating natural fires in a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going on in New York state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going on all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's most vigorously happening on
the West coast, but it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really classic landscape
management that we need for ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: health to then improve human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of to then the other question or
the other part about how do we protect
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves and prepare for wildfires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, there's been a lot of research in
building codes in the last two decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the 2008 building codes has been
borne out in a number of the recent fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the California wildfires since 2018
have supported this, as well as,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, the Lahaina wildfires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start teeing up our transition to
Hawaii in a second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, there are ways,
including many low-cost ways, of
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining a home and the landscape
around a home that significantly reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: the likelihood of the home burning down
when the wildfires come through,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in a high-risk area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's called home hardening and
defensible space are the two words that I
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend people look up if you're
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, California has done so much
work on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: State government there has a lot of public
resources about how to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: including a low-cost retrofit list of how
to do this cheaply for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longer answer than you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to ask you, while Scott is
teeing up, have you ever heard about the
[SPEAKER_00]: art project from LA called Pigeon Blog?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of filling in data space,
an artist in LA trying to deal with an air
[SPEAKER_00]: quality issue, not fire, but air quality
issue, outfitted pigeons with sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all reported back, and it
interpolated between the official sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just in terms of the one health
working amongst and between species to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about our shared airspace,
I just think it might be like a fun side
[SPEAKER_00]: topic about how to interpolate air quality
with a multi-species kind of perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it could also just be a true
data gathering, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just put it in the chat just
because I think it's so fun and fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really appreciate your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
