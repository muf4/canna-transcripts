[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topic for today is I chose the words
carefully when I named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really study climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really interested in measuring the
minutiaes of carbon and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am on the other end of it and that's why
I chose the word confronting because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what it feels like we're doing all
the time with the professionals that I
[SPEAKER_01]: work with in my role as an extension
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so I have a couple of words to work
through today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously confronting is the way I feel
much of my work both in research and
[SPEAKER_01]: extension goes and because I'm not a
government scientist I can still say
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite a big joke in Canada I can
tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And urban grasslands right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you know I like many of the people
who do what I do around the country you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the turf guy in Nebraska,
the turf guy in Wisconsin, I've been the
[SPEAKER_01]: turf guy in New York and now I have to
figure out how to make something cool out
[SPEAKER_01]: of urban grasslands because that seems to
be the trendy term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at what I want to cover with
you in the little bit of time that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how I've organized my work and how
I view the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly when you hear the word grasslands
it might hearken you to the savannas,
[SPEAKER_01]: the great savannas of Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you say urban grasslands my
sense is this is what most people think
[SPEAKER_01]: that somehow they think it must be a
prairie we get to have in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again you know the idea that this
isn't a managed landscape you know is sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to have it where there's
people it's going to have to be managed
[SPEAKER_01]: and I spend my entire career working with
the people stuck with these things and
[SPEAKER_01]: being asked now to sequester more carbon
or reduce their emissions or protect water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality when no one was sort of worried
about it in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really in a bit of a pickle having
to convince the industry the actual front
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of this mitigating the issues of
climate change when I think when the
[SPEAKER_01]: lion's share of the people in urban
environments think about grasslands this
[SPEAKER_01]: must be what they think.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the beautiful Bethpage State Park
1500 acres nestled in literally the center
[SPEAKER_01]: of Long Island where I've spent a lot of
time researching and studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider this urban grassland even
though I mean of course you can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: development around there but I assure
there's houses all over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soccer complex outside of Boston you know
on a typical Saturday this is an urban
[SPEAKER_01]: grassland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously from the early days of
Leavittown in the 40s right we now have
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes that you know connect each
other by these close cut vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces in front of their dwellings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is grassland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's fascinating
when you study it as an academic you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you read so much about the influence that
the humans have on the things that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do to produce these grasslands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the study of behavior of how people
care for their lawns in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes and has been shown in several
studies to be very much related to
[SPEAKER_01]: mimicry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it you know I think in casual
terms we call it keeping up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Joneses or you know not having a lawn that
looks worse than somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's our own form of mimicry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want in general to have our space to
look like everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: How else could you tolerate some of these
living conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living that closely to each other spoken
as a true city boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the urban grasslands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you can imagine by their name they're
in the urban areas and you can see all
[SPEAKER_01]: along Long Island the metropolitan New
York area that little bit of Connecticut
[SPEAKER_01]: that thinks it's part of New York and then
up the Hudson Valley to Albany Utica
[SPEAKER_01]: Syracuse Buffalo Rochester you can see it
very clearly in our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course throughout the United States
you see where the great grasslands are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because they're urban they're
typically associated with impervious
[SPEAKER_01]: surface right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the story from the NASA spectral
work that Malesi did many years ago back
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2005 where they looked at the spectral
cover and said you know this is much
[SPEAKER_01]: there's as much turf area as there is
irrigated corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a bit of a misnomer not all turf
is irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of the turf you're looking at
there is irrigated as all the irrigated
[SPEAKER_01]: corn is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the relationship between where grass
is and how we manage it right is
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately the challenges that I face
working with the people who manage these
[SPEAKER_01]: grasslands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot separate yourself from people
in my line of work as much as I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you know I love the day I get to
work what an apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just you know get to drive 30
miles to see one I got to drive 30 miles
[SPEAKER_01]: to see another.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the end user is so intimately
associated with the surface right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean when you sell an apple or a bottle
of cider unless you're the farmer you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get direct feedback from the people
who you are dealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my line of work you get more feedback
than you'd ever want to get from the
[SPEAKER_01]: public and so you have to learn how to
filter and we have to learn as I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn as an extension scientist what are
the pressures that the people that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working with are under from the people
that they're there and where are they and
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we set a system that they can
somewhere meet in between between what the
[SPEAKER_01]: public wants and needs right and the
management of these surfaces has to adapt
[SPEAKER_01]: to now with the changing climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people put enormous influence on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of great pictures you know
preparation for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read a whole bunch of work that's gone
on throughout the world really with things
[SPEAKER_01]: like reduction in in crime associated with
you know just keeping the place nice
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping it occasionally clipped doesn't
have to be manicured like center field of
[SPEAKER_01]: Yankee Stadium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's well kept there's plenty of
evidence to show that these green
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes promote good behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this there's this policing idea
that we follow in American police work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a broken window approach where
you stop these little crimes and then
[SPEAKER_01]: supposedly that's supposed to stop the big
ones and that sort of mentality in urban
[SPEAKER_01]: areas is penetrated into the landscape and
so they need stuff really literally broken
[SPEAKER_01]: all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of important benefits of course
easily defined through the Millennium
[SPEAKER_01]: Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: My colleague my colleague Jenny Gow Niffin
and Grant Thompson published a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: paper really a very important one of those
papers that will probably get cited for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next 30 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know integrating basic ecological
concepts and ecosystem service stuff into
[SPEAKER_01]: the management of these grasslands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I of course stole liberally from my
colleagues like any good colleague will
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll pay them the proper credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this mindset is one that I've been
sort of waiting for from my own
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective because I believe the approach
that we have to have in these urban
[SPEAKER_01]: environments is define the value of these
green spaces these green infrastructures
[SPEAKER_01]: grasses or otherwise for the surfaces they
provide because I hate to say it we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are blind to the plants around us in
urban areas plant blindness is a known
[SPEAKER_01]: malady.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't see plants and when they do
they only see them when they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty like perfect lawns or weedy lawns
and then they are then they imply that
[SPEAKER_01]: mimicry judgment on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get caught up in this one little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fussing about this one little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My entire industry is focused on 80
percent of the time this one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not kidding you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what about all these other things
that are important and how this vegetation
[SPEAKER_01]: services the urban areas and why I'm
worried about it is because when you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at what happened in California recently as
a result of the drought last couple years
[SPEAKER_01]: they just started paying people to rip
grass out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They paid over 30 40 million dollars
paying people to take their grass out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you what they put in in a minute
but you know the green industry out there
[SPEAKER_01]: was completely ill-prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golf courses were taking money like crazy
they were paying on a per square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: basis just to take the irrigated grass out
to which I said well what the hell was it
[SPEAKER_01]: there to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could take it out that easy just
for money why was it there to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the problem that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now because we're intimately linked to
sociological things and human behavior I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like sometime while I'm getting my
IRB certification now and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start doing more human surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's a pretty classic Gallup
question they've been asking since the
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the last 17 years but since the 19
80s when you well I'm sorry this is not
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the one from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry I have these in misorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of the following do you agree with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Protection of the environment should be
given priority even if curbing of economic
[SPEAKER_01]: growth should be or at the risk of curbing
economic growth or economic growth should
[SPEAKER_01]: be given priority even if the environment
suffers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you value?
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment or your pocketbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like for a really long time
through much of the 80s and 90s and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: notice this was a period of good economic
times when people aren't worried about the
[SPEAKER_01]: money that goes in their pocket they tend
to value things like environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty normal behavior and you can
see when the internet bubble happened and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the bubbles and blips and booms we've
had in our economy over the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how over that period of time
how much people are saying listen I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: have money the environment's going to have
to suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wonder how this guy got elected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay and I can take heed for making a joke
so I'm happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to stop taking ourselves so
seriously about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so this Danish these Dutch scientist
Dirksen et al just recently was looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: public acceptance and you know asked
citizens in the Netherlands in Rotterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what do they value about the
vegetation and green space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly what they call green
infrastructure of which close vegetated
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces make up a big part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they propose this idea of how the sort
of process you have to follow to get
[SPEAKER_01]: people to understand how to accept
essentially ecosystem services for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the urban environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can get the public to demand these
things from their municipalities they will
[SPEAKER_01]: get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we continue to just promote
aesthetics the way we adapt the climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change will be very difficult to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the value of these green spaces
there the notion of climate impacts
[SPEAKER_01]: concern about impacts rating green
infrastructure benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of green infrastructures do you
like and how much you're willing to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for that green infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question that came out of that
that they're trying to see the services
[SPEAKER_01]: that they value from the paper and they
asked them to rate which ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: services do you value the most and in the
various areas right they were given
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my line of work right you see them
value stormwater management right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good with that and recreational visually
attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least I got you have to cut the
grass to play soccer on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't play it in the meadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's all well and good in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the people I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the people I have to deal with
on a pretty regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When asked do you believe which you know I
don't like using that word makes turns it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a sort of religious change global
warming is affecting golf course
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance and the largest percentage of
them say no climate change is crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the audience that I'm working
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what your audiences are like Steve
and you know Greg and everybody else's
[SPEAKER_01]: extension audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my extension right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we try to do and we
started this a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very fortunate to have such an
excellent communications professionals
[SPEAKER_01]: both in Craig and in my assistant Carl
Scamenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started this Twitter page over 1300
followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we get a lot of regular interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just in time media just focused on
getting them information promoting you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the right thing to do at the time
they need to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more likely to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this just in time way of delivering
information is perfect for the kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things I've got to deal with in my
extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So urban grasslands the benefits of them
obviously ecosystem services is the way I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we would quantify them but a
difficult not to crack and lots of things
[SPEAKER_01]: working against us in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about urban
climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's entirely different
than what's going to happen in other areas
[SPEAKER_01]: except the streams might be different
because of the amount of impervious
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces right and you know infrastructure
that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally I'm sure you've heard from Artie
Gaetano anybody talks about climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're expecting a increase and we
have seen more heavy rain events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally we have not overall been that
much wetter year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the season lengths are
changing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the frosts comes how hard the winter
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you put the word urban in
front of climate change it gets people all
[SPEAKER_01]: working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we've looked up
because when it rains a lot it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: a farm field that is drained into a ditch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of paved surfaces and it's
got to move water great distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not designed to do that which
many of the systems are not designed to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that because they were designed before we
had this kind of weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they're old and they need to be
rebuilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at urban as well as you know the
heat island effect and more intense
[SPEAKER_01]: storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the things you talk about with
climate change in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in urban areas when you look at
the literature on urban climate change it
[SPEAKER_01]: almost entirely focuses on how there's a
lot of people and a lot of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urban areas put a disproportionate amount
of pressure on green space right because
[SPEAKER_01]: they need it for the things that are
necessary to survive in an urban
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have plants in those
environments or at least have plants
[SPEAKER_01]: around those environments to service
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of poor people of course and you
know countries that are not as fortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: as ours also are going to suffer more
greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we want to make sure the grass
is covered so you know the soil doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longer seasons mean our recreational
surfaces get a lot more traffic and this
[SPEAKER_01]: has made synthetic turf very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even going to open up that can
of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an entire nother
presentation about the pits and perils and
[SPEAKER_01]: perceptions of synthetic turf and where it
plays a role and where it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have pretty good data on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that allows even
poor communities to have good playing
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces is when they do a capital project
at a school district the state of New York
[SPEAKER_01]: for example will pay 85 cents on every
dollar and the local community only has to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get a synthetic turf field for
$150,000 while the state pays the other
[SPEAKER_01]: $850,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now of course we all pay for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one of the reasons you're
starting to see more synthetic turf as
[SPEAKER_01]: well because when these scholastic seasons
happen the grass isn't growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how many of you have watched them
plow snow and play lacrosse on the
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it pretty regularly through the
winter around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urban climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you have a lot of urban areas
here in the northeast and this is an
[SPEAKER_01]: example of this past February.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drought like conditions we were
entering the growing season with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entering the growing season with big
pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some pretty dry weather a couple of
years ago here in the Finger Lakes and
[SPEAKER_01]: made it into the red status a couple of
times into extreme drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love these NOAA maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time they see me talk and I'm
talking about growing something or we're
[SPEAKER_01]: having an update on something they're
going to get an updated map of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on because I think it's very hard
for people to realize we've been keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: weather records at least by human
standards a pretty long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 122 years not by other time scales but by
our ability to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these were handwritten of course
back then for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consistently over the last decade
you're looking at record warm temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes incredibly dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's when I say confronting
climate change I tell people look what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the data because people that have
have trouble getting their arms around
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change to begin with for whatever
you know reason that might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the data is compelling unless
we fire everybody at NOAA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except art.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to keep art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I'm sure you've seen this
from many of the climate reports that if
[SPEAKER_01]: this continues unabated and we're starting
to see it now when you look at lengths of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing seasons the metropolitan New York
area is slowly creeping into Philadelphia
[SPEAKER_01]: land.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slowly starting to get growing
conditions like we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Philadelphia when it comes to the grasses
in these urban environments in these urban
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course in these urban environments
with the pervious surface you get the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: island effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it rains the hutch floods.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you from downstate the
Hutchinson River Parkway the classic
[SPEAKER_01]: flooding conditions on a pretty regular
basis growing up around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet there's green space and I can tell
you you could hit a driver and probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: on 50 golf courses around the Hutchinson
River Parkway over a 10 mile strip of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hutchinson River Parkway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not a single one of those golf courses
have probably been approached to maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: help with this problem and easily with
some manipulation of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing this in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going into the park districts and
they're saying you know we're flooding
[SPEAKER_01]: like crazy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built all these houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We paved all this ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we redesign this part of the
golf course make a big hole and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: cistern in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done this on three or four
golf courses now in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some places just big collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem that that brings is we let
homeowners apply nutrients and chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides to their lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is I don't this is this is a big
problem because you're talking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: sixty five billion dollar industry turf
industry in the United States about sixty
[SPEAKER_01]: five billion dollars and retail sales of
Lord lawn and garden supplies alone in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014 almost six billion and you see that
the majority of them are fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides right over 50 percent
fertilizers and pesticides not as much
[SPEAKER_01]: seed as we'd like them to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means there's a lot of products in
the system that can be spilled on those
[SPEAKER_01]: impervious surfaces that can be applied to
thin areas that could drain and run if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're thin right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you have good dense vegetation
even slopes it'll it'll retain and slow
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the water that will go across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marty Petrovic studied this many years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zach Easton was a graduate student here
back in the early 2000s and did these
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape scale sampling studies looking
at runoff just water runoff just the
[SPEAKER_01]: material water running off these surfaces
and low maintenance turf that has very
[SPEAKER_01]: thin conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that's fascinating you
see the amount of runoff that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs in the winter and so not a fully
covered ground the wooded areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marty talked about how the leaves wet
leaves seal up the surface and when the
[SPEAKER_01]: rain was coming the water would run along
the surface and in this case where he was
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining with fertilizer and even
pesticides the water volume running off
[SPEAKER_01]: that turf and it's not surprising right
and this shouldn't be surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass is fibrous root system big surface
organic matter a perennial crop at the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck me and he'll tell you if you mow it
it'll just grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need to do anything just
mow it and leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so if it's you know I would like to
just see some dense low maintenance turf
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know he didn't have good density
when he did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now just to reinforce the pesticide use
issue this is data from 2012 from the zip
[SPEAKER_01]: codes surveys that the all certified
applicators of pesticides in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State private and commercial have to
report their pesticide use by zip code and
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is one of the only useful pieces
of data that's come out of the last 22
[SPEAKER_01]: years of that data collection that
occasionally they get around to putting
[SPEAKER_01]: these maps out with pesticide use and of
course if you look at pesticide use you
[SPEAKER_01]: might notice that there's an awful lot of
pesticide use in areas where there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of farming going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of farming going on here
and of course you could make the argument
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of this is agriculture out here
but that sort of looks like Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sort of look one of these is
Rochester one of these is this is Syracuse
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so obviously even in Portland big big
agricultural region here lots of pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: use but this is the concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The focus of pesticide use in these urban
areas where things can be more mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: USGS surveys I don't expect you to see
this it's just get an idea of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticide use and how it's showing up in
the streams that the USGS survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a lot of it in these urban
areas mixed land use areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's all the urban areas right and some
of them had the highest 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right highest 25 percent insecticide
concentration in the streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got data that says if you keep the
turf in good shape it might not release
[SPEAKER_01]: the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you put it on a large scale
there's got to be some exponential effect
[SPEAKER_01]: from little bits here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very suspicious that we contribute to
this because obviously rodenticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: other insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just insecticides but we use
insecticides for you know pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously this is I would think from a
lot of landscape use which drives people
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show up in meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever been in a meeting where somebody
dresses like that and your job's supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to stand up and talk to them about
reasonable pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is you cannot talk to
these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to talk to these people because
they can talk to these people.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got to slow down use but we got
nuts over here that's you know we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: reason with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just feels like it pulls the
whole debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you as a modern extension
scientist in an urban area dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to see me because you know to
a certain extent I help them and then
[SPEAKER_01]: aggravate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I help these people and then I
aggravate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost feel like maybe that's the
role in these contentious sociological
[SPEAKER_01]: things that someone has to sort of mediate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's sort of a progressive
role for modern extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway what about worse streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some I don't sure everybody's in
the environmental communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been paying attention to this but
this came out in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: The province of Ontario in Canada banned
all pesticide use on home loans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you cannot go to Home Depot or any of
the places and use you can't buy
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides for laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And commercial lawn care people can't
apply synthetic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you know antagonistic biocontrol
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of what's happened is they've
actually the lawn services are selling
[SPEAKER_01]: more cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting better lawns by seeding
them to good varieties and fixing the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what banning chemicals has
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other the other thing that banning
chemicals have done and I don't expect you
[SPEAKER_01]: to see the details of this but these are
the three major components of the typical
[SPEAKER_01]: broad leaf herbicide used in turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three active ingredients 2,4-D everybody's
buddy these days Dicamba and Mechaprop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dark bars are these whisker plots
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you notice works this is 50 percent of
the data and then the wider areas and then
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're significantly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dark bar let's just focus in on
the Dicamba in this particular stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sampled all these streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see it almost every case not
always statistically significant but most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The at before the band the concentration
of the materials in the stream before the
[SPEAKER_01]: band and after the band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are all dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these things move out of the
environment a little bit quicker than
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dealing with legacy phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing these reductions in
phosphorus as a result of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus in urban environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing that reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still think it's because we've got
to sweep the street every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got paved surfaces to drain into the
drain and then they go into the rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've confronted this I would say
particular issue of water quality as a
[SPEAKER_01]: result of these intense rains and public
concern for pesticide use to develop these
[SPEAKER_01]: best management practices for golf courses
that serve as codifying the standards golf
[SPEAKER_01]: courses can be held due for water quality
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've gone completely insane and
may be working with the landscape industry
[SPEAKER_01]: in especially in downstate New York which
most of them are of my nationality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it creates quite an interesting dynamic
when you have to tell them to do things
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have absolutely no interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are science based standards that
we hope ensure the highest level of water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put this in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if you don't maintain a landscape
that someone will pay for you can't be in
[SPEAKER_01]: the landscaping business and that business
and industry is not going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to keep existing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to figure out how to meet them
in this and it's not going to be it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reducing admissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a bunch of students together back in
2007 and then in 2008 we published the
[SPEAKER_01]: study that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just took and interviewed about 15 golf
courses throughout New York state and
[SPEAKER_01]: asked them about their first fertilizer
and chemicals and mowing programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got averages for what the average golf
course in New York state would emit in
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we didn't look at nitrogen emissions
that I'll talk to you about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't look at anything but carbon
and the question was can a golf course be
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took our survey information and
applied it to what the GCSA the golf
[SPEAKER_01]: superintendents association a big
association in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Says the average golf course in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the average golf course about 150
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see very little in the putting
surfaces and tea grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it is in fairways and rough on a
percentage basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the chemical and fertilizer
treatments are confined to these three
[SPEAKER_01]: areas and around here mostly to the greens
in the central New York area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at direct energy consumption
did some calculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on carbon equivalents for the
various energy units.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all these units and not we didn't
have any coal fired equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had all the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had a way of calculating based
on their fuel use and the kind of fuel it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started looking at the way
they mowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is some work that the Toro
company did and we looked at it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case this is a mowing pad a mower
with a GPS device on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they either collected the clippings
off the fairway or didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about how much longer it takes
to mow a fairway to put these pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: stripes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about three times the carbon
emission as simply driving longways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just driving longways and a farmer will
tell you that because you spend most of
[SPEAKER_01]: your time turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you dump the clippings it adds
about an hour to the mow time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you know if you're mowing fairways
you're in no rush to get off that piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment as frequently as you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tend to take your time doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been exploring robotic mowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go crazy with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got four of these guys running
around mowing day or night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proper amount or too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to try to see if we can
build the crude elements of a smart system
[SPEAKER_01]: by integrating irrigation sensors into
this because I don't believe people can be
[SPEAKER_01]: trusted to manage their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if we start plugging everything in
then we've got different issues and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to the industry nationally about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does your power come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everybody starts plugging their cars in
and we're burning more coal or burning
[SPEAKER_01]: other fossil fuels I'm not entirely sure
that helps us completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done a lot of education just hey
guys think about where your power comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if you start plugging in more and
more things and you're in Idaho where 93
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of your power is hydroelectric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well maybe that's not a bad thing to plug
more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also embodied energy on the golf
course the carbon equivalents that's
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with nutrient use the macro
nutrients in particular and the ranges of
[SPEAKER_01]: materials that we can get from West's
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the easiest thing to do and
the range you see is very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we have the active ingredients
carbon equivalents many times we use the
[SPEAKER_01]: average right because it's not all the
active ingredients have been assessed for
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon equivalents associated with
your manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put this all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it against our Beth Page project
years ago where we had where we were
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying less pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see in general the numbers are
the same except we cut our fertilizer use
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically in our IPM program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now interestingly the pesticide use went
up but a lot of these are softer materials
[SPEAKER_01]: OMRI certified materials but there still
are pesticides so it gave us a big number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the biggest reduction we saw
was in fertilizer use in that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now not really interested in the different
types of management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at roughly the equations you'd
use for look at the amount of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestered on the golf course an average
golf course in a season and then roughly
[SPEAKER_01]: what we would emit from carbon not the
nitrogen component and that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: weakness to this preliminary work anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you saw a slight reduction maybe about
four or five tons of carbon equivalents
[SPEAKER_01]: per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: A U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: auto is about 3.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know a golf course at least the way
we measured it this first time is not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily problematic from a carbon
perspective but I think the total
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse gas thing I'm going to show you
a different actual science done on it not
[SPEAKER_01]: a student project but actual science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also been studying emerging pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I published a paper with R.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaetano back in 2006 where we looked at
the increasing disease pressure associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with the changing climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a model that predicts fungal
infection of turf and we ground truth it
[SPEAKER_01]: to diagnostic labs in the northeast so
that for a couple of years we were you
[SPEAKER_01]: know looking at our model and seeing if it
was predicting it where we were testing it
[SPEAKER_01]: and then checking diagnostic labs if
regionally we were on target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use this in our extension program
in our forecasting and moving towards push
[SPEAKER_01]: notifications for when risks of disease go
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hoping to get that kind of thing added.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all predicated on the
environmental conditions conducive to the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew what the conditions were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art went back and scanned 50 years of data
to see if we're getting any more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what happens when you do no
pesticide work on a golf course where
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been spraying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you notice in this slide is all
these black dots are where we reviewed the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather and found that the weather
conditions are increasing for the
[SPEAKER_01]: incidence of this disease in the last 50
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact the model even picked up something
we've been observing now for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: decade that we're seeing more of this
fungal pathogen pressure in the late fall
[SPEAKER_01]: than we used to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are definitely at least with this
pest seeing big, big changes and that
[SPEAKER_01]: requires us to spray more at a time when
the public is less interested in us
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our most recent venture,
the Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably I hope I can study out there for
the rest of my career and into my
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement because some of the things I
want to do can really only be done in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial setting first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the public won't really
understand it if it can't be sort of done
[SPEAKER_01]: in a commercial way and then scaled down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're going to accept robot
mowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try robot mowers out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem Greenwood Cemetery is
having doesn't seem like a big deal but
[SPEAKER_01]: that Zoysia grass that started to be,
it was about three acres by general
[SPEAKER_01]: estimation about five or six years ago and
now it's close to eight acres covering the
[SPEAKER_01]: cemetery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to be directly related
especially the last few years with the
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very warm winters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoysia japonica is a imported Zoysia
species to this country naturalized for
[SPEAKER_01]: turf throughout the United States and
planted cold hardy varieties planted
[SPEAKER_01]: north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pretty good when they're green
which is two and a half months,
[SPEAKER_01]: three months a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're in a cemetery the most
important day of the year is Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother's Day and this grass is straw brown
on Mother's Day and it's growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now our question is chemically we can
spray it and intercede into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the landscapes are tricky to do
that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if we can't have a mixed
warm season, cool season grass mixture of
[SPEAKER_01]: C3 and C4 plants in year long.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has happened, I was in St. Louis last
week and I visit that area particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm interested in the transition
zone where you watch climate change in
[SPEAKER_01]: action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line of where Bermuda grass can grow
Cynodon keeps creeping up and creeping up
[SPEAKER_01]: about five to 10 miles a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys will tell you, yeah that guy used
to have Bermuda or used to have bank grass
[SPEAKER_01]: now he's got Bermuda because it's too warm
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't keep the cool season grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for I hope make it right to the 10
mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we maximize the benefits and
minimize the impacts?
[SPEAKER_01]: To me from my perspective if I can get a
decent answer to that question I'll feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're closer to sustainability than
we were before and let's be fair the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of inputs we use for the grasses
sometimes is the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the same amount of benefits in many
cases without a lot of inputs without a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we need and of course this is the
trendy thing right there these resilient
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes these landscapes that can take
these cold and warm conditions dry and wet
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they did with the lawns in
California and you know what's funny this
[SPEAKER_01]: was right after they were planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: No water was put in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you think those plants live?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the over under maybe three weeks
before they and they were actually dead
[SPEAKER_01]: but they didn't pull them out probably for
six months and companies ran around
[SPEAKER_01]: California taking money doing this and
then now they live in the Caymans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you affect this kind of change
and so the first thing you do is you get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the architects because many of them
design the landscapes that look good on
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things look good on paper and
then managing them and the benefits that
[SPEAKER_01]: they provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a number of years ago I had another
group of students and I don't know if this
[SPEAKER_01]: has ever actually become part of the
site's initial initiative but the site's
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative sustainable sites initiative
I'm sure you've heard Nina maybe Don other
[SPEAKER_01]: people talk about this collection of
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the lead system that the US
Green Building Council uses that idea for
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How we build landscapes that are
sustainable and the first go at this they
[SPEAKER_01]: said no grass for you Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had grass in your landscape you
could not be viewed as a sustainable site
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think hopefully they've changed it a
little bit and here's what we propose.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all we want to get all grasslands
to require minimum energy water and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical inputs for their intended use
while supporting outdoor exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So design points activity point design
activity points they support no community
[SPEAKER_01]: activity they're just for look passive
recreation picnicking walking okay a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of traffic and then supports
athletic activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the kind of thing we've got to get
people to understand and of course you see
[SPEAKER_01]: this in action when you go to a place like
Central Park where they prioritize the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawns they've got intensely traffic soccer
fields and the sheep's meadow and then
[SPEAKER_01]: another area where it's fenced off and no
one goes in and other areas where the dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: go and there's very little grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part is the ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we put this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you using it for with the
benefits it provides right sites designed
[SPEAKER_01]: to require maintenance for any low usage
area you get if you have the high main
[SPEAKER_01]: pain just for aesthetic purposes an area
that doesn't get used much you get no
[SPEAKER_01]: points for that too for moderate
maintenance right and we put some other
[SPEAKER_01]: things in here and it comes up with an
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this may seem goofy to you but this is
the world people who build things live in
[SPEAKER_01]: and if we can get them thinking like this
at the front end the management of these
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes are inherently more focused and
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they've started to study this is
happening more and more now they've
[SPEAKER_01]: studied how do how can urban grassland
reduce emission and increase carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Aaron Patton at Purdue University had a
graduate student that looked at this and
[SPEAKER_01]: this isn't that study this is a study of
sort of how you have to fertilize Kentucky
[SPEAKER_01]: bluegrass to keep the weeds out but that's
aesthetics right except that this is awful
[SPEAKER_01]: thin and maybe the runoff will be bad but
if you seeded it maybe more grass would
[SPEAKER_01]: emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want the lowest emissions that
managing turf can give so um there's a you
[SPEAKER_01]: can plant Kentucky bluegrass never
defoliate it more than 30 percent and
[SPEAKER_01]: return the clippings.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right let's get that now if you want
the latest carbon accumulation you plant
[SPEAKER_01]: tall fescue a more rapidly growing rapidly
organic matter producing species
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliated 30 percent of the times return
the clipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's right now these are the pieces of
data we've got we've got a long way to go
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our approach with the homeowner is the
lawn care stuff I want to I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: skip right to you so we're done yeah sorry
about that sorry for the delay sorry to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep you so don't feel like if you got to
go you can't go I'm happy to stay and
[SPEAKER_01]: answer questions if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much
[SPEAKER_03]: from Ithaca or Geneva like you're saying
that turf grass in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: is fairly significant on when you look at
the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm wondering what you think are
some of the barriers to homeowners per se
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of realizing that they're they have a
could make an impact on some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to me the question is how do
we get homeowners to look at their lawn
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond just what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes it seems like they do have to say well
you know my lawn is so small like doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right I mean what I would tell you
is just make sure it's densely vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now that's the best data we've got
that even if you have what you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of annual weeds that come and go
but if you can maintain a perennial
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation that's a collection of broad
leaves and grassy plants and they're dense
[SPEAKER_01]: we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is there's you know this is a
big cultural thing and I can write a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: paper on just the cultural things about
this but you know the parents did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that we still
can't let go from leave it to beaver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that you know Scott's
plows a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott's alone is a three billion dollar
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it's a like many things in a
capitalist society we have industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: industry sometimes drives perception just
like you know pictures in magazines drive
[SPEAKER_01]: the cosmetic industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see you see a pretty baseball field or
a beautiful golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can tell you that's a shrinking
proportion of the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the next generation could
give to whatever for their lawn just
[SPEAKER_01]: because they got so much they don't have a
lot of time to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time becomes a bigger commodity that that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we break through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough thing because we're not well
funded with a marketing program.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know our our lawn website gets about
1400 hits a day in April and May 1400 and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's nothing compared to what guys who
make goofy videos on YouTube about lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: The insect side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something playing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of like so deer ticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah of course of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question about ticks in these
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we don't know Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some suggestions that and and
generally we see it but not as a rule that
[SPEAKER_01]: mowed lawns where deer don't frequent and
lay and you know because it's a fairly dry
[SPEAKER_01]: environment out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally aren't big havens but ecotones
the edges are enormous because they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there like it's a it's the
gladiators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see all the carbon dioxide out there
with the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not going out there because
it's inhospitable to them unless they get
[SPEAKER_01]: on a deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get on a deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're in your lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit trickier to get on you
unless you're a little person and you go
[SPEAKER_01]: in your bare feet in your onesie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're a little bit more even on a
lawn a little bit more at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no definitive population.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough ecological data to
say yet what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know for sure they're at the wood
lines around the lawns in enormously high
[SPEAKER_01]: populations as we'd expect after a master.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the very first one where it says
zero shouldn't be a zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: What should it be.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one site grassland support no
community activity other than aesthetic or
[SPEAKER_05]: observation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's incredibly important to
understand that green spaces even if you
[SPEAKER_05]: can't walk on it or play ball on it is
incredibly important for sustainability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just there's data that show even
publications in the Nature Journal about
[SPEAKER_05]: the value of being able to look at green
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what all the studies show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So patients recover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's well but this you know I'm not
even sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even I don't even think that these
have ever been drafted because most of
[SPEAKER_00]: that's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is basically saying it has no
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no community activity other than
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are saying instead of observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your point is well taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should give that points for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made these critics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah we made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: No no no it's not part of sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't let us in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were saying that this is no
no we propose this to them and we put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it in the format to send it to them
but I still don't think it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No but did they take the points approach
which we propose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we should look to see if it's not
written like that but they do consider
[SPEAKER_04]: well adapted to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they've given it a zero we should
probably go back and fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
Thank you very much.
