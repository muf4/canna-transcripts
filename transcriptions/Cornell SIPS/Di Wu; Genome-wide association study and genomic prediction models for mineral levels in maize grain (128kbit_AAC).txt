[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to present my results on
genome-wide association study and genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction for mineral levels in maize
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mineral nutrient deficiencies can cause
very serious health problems, including,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, iron-deficient anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in this map,
especially in developing nations,
[SPEAKER_00]: some can have over 40% of the population
that can be affected by anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to put things into perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: the current concentration in maize kernels
are not enough to meet the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: daily allowance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is especially the case where in
the area where maize are the staple food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first row here, you can see the
RDA for iron zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And note that the male and female have
different recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second row here are the USDA's
maize average in dry kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for iron, it's 2.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for zinc, it's 2.2, which is far less
than the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the third row here, I'm presenting
the harvest plus breeding goal for iron
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for iron, it's 6 milligram per 100
gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for zinc, it's 3.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the goal we've been working
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two goals for the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to do dissection and
selection for the nine mineral levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this includes to perform GWAS to help
identify the causative loci, and then to
[SPEAKER_00]: build and validate the GP models.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using Ames population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a collection of about 2,000 maize
inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it captures a high level of allelic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in the MDS plot,
it has non-stiff stalks and diff stalk
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm, and also have tropical
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Ames panel were grown in 2012 and
2013 at Purdue, West Lafayette.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kernels were then sent to Flinders
University to be grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ICP-MS were performed to generate
the phenotypic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to perform GWAS and GP study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for now, we only have one year's data,
which is 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the results I'm presenting today
are based on one year's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I calculated bluffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, they're near
normal distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we compare back to what we talked
about before, so the average in my panel
[SPEAKER_00]: for ion zinc are 2.3 and 3.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for zinc, it's near the breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for iron, even my best lines cannot
reach the harvest plus breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing the pairwise trait
correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the nine traits are positively
correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest correlation is between
phosphorus and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And iron and zinc are actually moderately
correlated with 0.53 coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is good news because we want to
improve the two traits together in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mase kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these traits is very good for
GWAS study, like molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is mostly controlled by a single
large effect locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see in the Manhattan plot
here, in chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene is actually cloned in
eryptopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is called MOT1, which is an MO
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the green lines here shows the FDR
corrected p-value of 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, ion zinc, there are more
polygenic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you can see here, there are a lot
of small peaks that pass the threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are much smaller effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have much smaller effect sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tells me one thing is that
probably for ion zinc are not good for
[SPEAKER_00]: can, sorry, probably marker assistant
selection are not enough or good enough
[SPEAKER_00]: for ion zinc because they're controlled by
so many small effective QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the better method would be
genomic prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the GP, we use five fold cross
validation and 10 iterations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm showing the average
predictability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, ion has the highest
predictability of 0.49.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for zinc, it's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a predictability of 0.38.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just to make the full use of our
GP model, we applied the GP model trained
[SPEAKER_00]: on aims to the semi-mast lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, in theory, should have high
transferability if the two populations
[SPEAKER_00]: share a high number of aims.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in the PCA here,
so the blue dots are the aims panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow dots is the semi-lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the circle actually is the tropical
subpopulation inside the aims panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the semi-lines and the
tropical lines actually co-localized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing the genomic estimated
breeding value for the semi-lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the green box plot here is the
average GBV for CMLs using 80% of the aims
[SPEAKER_00]: panel as a training set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that for five iterations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a comparison in the blue box
plots, we're showing just the aims,
[SPEAKER_00]: GBV for aims trained on aims, so the cross
validations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as expected, it has much smaller
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The semi-lines have smaller variation than
the aims lines, which is to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just co-localized with one of
the aims subpopulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually just got the CML
phenotypes from CEMET Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to do validation on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step would be to do fine
dissection of the candida gene regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially for the more tractal
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do validation of GP models in the
CEMET panel, and then ultimately do
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement of mineral traits with genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to thank my
committee member, Mike, Alina,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Robert, all the GWR-LAT members for
the support, my collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Torbert and James, and also Harris Plus
and CEMET for providing the funding and
[SPEAKER_00]: the data.
