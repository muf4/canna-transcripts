[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donnie, Peter Woodbury and I are just
researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to just say thanks to Dave Wolf
and Ag and Markets for supporting this so
[SPEAKER_00]: that just the researchers, just the
farmers, just the policymakers,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the educators can meet in a room
together and come up with a just plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, climate change,
I've been doing it for a while and I went
[SPEAKER_00]: through a period of despair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I no longer have that sense of despair
because it is one gigantic puzzle and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing us an opportunity to join forces
because soil health, water quality and air
[SPEAKER_00]: quality are all connected to our great
lunches that we eat on a day like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to frame the talk for how farms,
landowners and citizens can promote
[SPEAKER_00]: resiliency through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you one example,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With climate change, we have a longer
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an opportunity for double
cropping, which increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestration and slows the rate of
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases the resilience, resiliency by
reducing erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces the impact from extreme weather
events by being able to absorb extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it increases productivity because we
are working to which results in local and
[SPEAKER_00]: global sustainability, increasing
knowledge and maximizing impacts for
[SPEAKER_00]: future generation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a point and we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give some context, Cuomo has an
executive order 166, which has a goal of
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 by 30, which is a 40 percent reduction
in 1990 levels of greenhouse gases by 2030
[SPEAKER_00]: and 80 by 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an 80 percent reduction by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge group effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's tons of programs that there
are out there to support these agendas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't seen some of these
names, look for them because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for all of us in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we talk about greenhouse gases,
most people think about CO2 because indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: most of our greenhouse gases come from
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big piece of that pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two smaller pieces are methane and
nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I say this is because in
agriculture, we think beyond carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must also consider methane and nitrous
oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I will be talking a little bit
about nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrous oxide related to nitrogen
fertilizer in the soil, but methane
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to other ag practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why it's important to talk
about these other greenhouse gases is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have different global warming
potentials and these different gases have
[SPEAKER_00]: different impacts on the earth's warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to compare them or think
about them, we have this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if CO2 by definition has a global
warming potential of one, what you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: notice is that nitrous oxide is 300 times
more potent of a greenhouse gas than CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point being here is managing nitrogen
on your shield is incredibly important,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, because it has that factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we avoid emitting greenhouse
gases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples involving carbon dioxide and
nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can avoid producing carbon-based
greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reduce tractor passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reduce synthetic nitrogen purchase,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic nitrogen is a really
energy-intensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're reducing the fuel used at that
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can avoid the greenhouse gas impact
from nitrogen processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reduce your synthetic nitrogen use to
reduce the fuel nitrous oxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you manage your manure to also reduce
the fuel nitrous oxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some ways that we can mitigate or reduce
greenhouse gases with the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestering carbon dioxide in soils,
in food products or other products,
[SPEAKER_00]: root systems, wood or wood products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do this through promoting
vegetative cover, perennials, cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: improve pasture and grazing, add biochars
or other amendments to soil, increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yield by double-cropping, plant rows of
trees, buffer strips, and new forest
[SPEAKER_00]: marginal lands, and manage your wood lots
to increase the carbon in both the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the important things, though,
in thinking about carbon sequestration,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly with soils, is this concept
of permanence.
[SPEAKER_00]: For carbon sequestration to have a
meaningful impact on the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's necessary to ensure that the carbon
remains sequestered and is not released to
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So years of carbon built up in soils can
be released back to the atmosphere in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point here is some strategies are
permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others are not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the soil health strategies
we've been talking about today are
[SPEAKER_00]: important for productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things are better, applicable to
mitigating climate change, and others are
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize, conserve or improve
vegetative cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can protect agriculture and forest
lands from development, defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move towards soil sequestration
mechanisms, including perennials,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops, reduce tillage, biochar,
and improve pasture and grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: These practices against carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They improve productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reduce erosion, improve water
quality, and improve soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improve nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reduce the synthetic nitrogen
consumption to reduce the upstream
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions from producing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is both for agricultural lands,
but also for landscapes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manage manure and synthetic nitrogen on
the field to reduce field nitrous oxide
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: They remove emissions from fertilizer
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They improve profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They improve water quality, improve air
quality, and improve soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improve forest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than 60% of our state soil is
forested, and 30% is on ag land.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% of ag land is wooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farms can manage their woodlots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why these practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequester carbon in tree trunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Profitable, long-lived wood products
reduce erosion, improve water quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So improved soil health reduces greenhouse
gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as farms increase soil carbon,
that increases the soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop productivity, the water
infiltration, and retention, and can also
[SPEAKER_00]: sequester carbon in the soil and in the
products that we grow off the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: These mechanisms include tillage practices
for amendments, annual versus perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, cover crops, double crops,
and produce on-margin lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say that there are lots
of opportunities out there, and we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: start leveraging these opportunities for
these multiple benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are climate smart community
grants that are due July 27th for
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the projects include but are not
limited to reduction of future flood risks
[SPEAKER_00]: for implementation of municipal food waste
and composting programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Trees for Tributaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an application that's due in
September for planting trees along
[SPEAKER_00]: waterways as buffer strips for nutrient
benefit, but also it has a climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigating benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In February of 2018, and possibly in
February of 2019, the climate resilient
[SPEAKER_00]: farming allocates $2 million available,
and it covers 75% of the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this money is for agricultural waste
storage cover and flare systems by pairing
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer systems, green corridor,
conversion control, rotational grazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil conservation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the horizon, the Climate Action
Reserve, which is a carbon trading
[SPEAKER_00]: reserve, is revising their nitrogen
management credits, and those should be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out soon as another way to fund
nitrogen management on your acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need assessments to better quantify the
financial environmental benefits and
[SPEAKER_00]: costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to promote the best management
practices that we're already doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also include greenhouse gas
mitigation, the climate change adaptation
[SPEAKER_00]: and long-term resiliency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to create some policies to
provide science-based information to
[SPEAKER_00]: policy makers as they negotiate a
multitude of societal needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I would like to do is
open it up for questions or comments
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly on how we can think about
taking climate change into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of our work.
