[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Don said, I was an undergraduate
here and at the opposite end of this
[SPEAKER_03]: hallway work mounting herbarium specimens
back in my senior year is one of my jobs,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the better jobs I had here as an
undergrad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really nice to be back in this
building and relive memories of this
[SPEAKER_03]: building.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a lot to cover today,
probably more than I can cover,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we'll see how far we get today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I primarily want to talk about is
the role of botanic gardens that you may
[SPEAKER_03]: not think of in terms of plant exploration
and plant introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And give you the briefest of histories of
the Morris Arboretum, but then get into
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the work that I've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really focusing on China.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do some collecting in the United States
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I have time, we'll finish with
that, but mainly focus on China because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's exotic and they're good stories about
traveling in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Morris Arboretum was formerly an
estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: John and Lydia Morris, who were siblings,
moved there in 1887, set up their family
[SPEAKER_03]: estate or their country home there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's shown on the left of this slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, it was very open at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was sort of out in the country and
this really was a self-sustaining country
[SPEAKER_03]: estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very interested in all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were interested in antiques,
plants, artwork, and they collected plants
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as lots of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this shows the Rose Garden and the
conservatories back in the early 1930s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since then, the Arboretum has evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are still a collection and we really
think of ourselves as the
[SPEAKER_03]: collections-based botanic garden,
but we embellish the garden and embellish
[SPEAKER_03]: the collections with ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're well known for our Rose Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our historic collection of trees,
and Philadelphia has a pretty ideal
[SPEAKER_03]: climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of a sweet spot in terms of
growing trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the things like our big
cassora are the biggest of their kind,
[SPEAKER_03]: and certainly in Eastern North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Don said, we have a great witch hazel
collection, one of my interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magnolias is something we've had a
longstanding interest in, and then maples
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all of these are some of the
primary focuses, but we have other things
[SPEAKER_03]: we grow as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll give you a 30-second plant
exploration history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people think of the golden
age of plant exploration as the early
[SPEAKER_03]: 1900s when people like E.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilson were collecting first for beach
nurseries in England, and then for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Arno Arboretum in Boston.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Wilson is famous for lots of things,
including the dove tree, Davidia,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Vallucrada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Wilson also had a strong horticultural
interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later, after he broke his leg in
China, he traveled to Japan, which even
[SPEAKER_03]: then, travel was a little easier in Japan,
collected a lot of azaleas.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the Karumi azaleas, the first
introductions, were through Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was also interested in flowering
cherries, which is something that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: is long forgotten about E.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my great interests are
flowering cherries as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through World War II, China was still open
to Westerners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things like Metasequoia were able to
come out of China, as it were.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our big Metasequoia Grove at the
Morris Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say we're four hours pretty much
due south up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not that hard to get to
Philadelphia, but it's probably a full
[SPEAKER_03]: zone warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it feels like Nina always brings her
class down in April, and they feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: they've arrived in the tropics when they
come down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please come down and visit us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do we go plant exploring?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some of the reasons, and I won't
read through these, but I'll try and touch
[SPEAKER_03]: on not all of these, but many of these
today in my talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back in the late 70s, the Arboretum
identified regions around the world that
[SPEAKER_03]: we would target for plant exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these seem obvious,
the Eastern United States, Central China,
[SPEAKER_03]: going up into Manchuria or Northeastern
China, the Korean Peninsula, Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what might be less obvious are the
Balkans and Asia Minor, areas that have
[SPEAKER_03]: similar climates to Philadelphia,
and that yield plants of good ornamental
[SPEAKER_03]: interest for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were our goals in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where we've gone since then in
terms of plant exploration trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's better seen graphically on this
slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see in purple are the target
areas, and then the pins represent where
[SPEAKER_03]: we've gone since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've really, over the last,
it's almost 30 years now, really set some
[SPEAKER_03]: goals and been able to systematically
achieve those goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to start out this talk with
talking about invasiveness, because when I
[SPEAKER_03]: first started giving this talk,
that was always the first question that
[SPEAKER_03]: people ask, like, do you want to bring
back invasives?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I start with this and hopefully we'll
dispel that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps the greatest example or a great
example of invasives that were planted
[SPEAKER_03]: with great ideas and great intentions is
Callery pear or Pyrus calleriana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Planted and promoted widely starting in
the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the original plantings of
Bradford pear.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the original planting of Bradford
pear in College Park, Maryland,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great tree, looks really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are today, and they've really
done well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pruned well at the beginning,
and they've held up really well,
[SPEAKER_03]: other than the power lines on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all know the problems with Callery
pear.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the weak crotches and them
splitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think more important from an
ecological point of view is the
[SPEAKER_03]: invasiveness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's happened is originally there
was basically one clone planted,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is self-infertil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subsequently, additional clones were
planted, so there's out-crossing and fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have one of these, unfortunately,
in front of our house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually my neighbor's tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those little fruits, not only are they
annoying, but they stain the paint on your
[SPEAKER_03]: car, which is doubly annoying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were to drive I-95 from
Philadelphia to Washington when the
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoshino cherries were in flower,
this is what you would see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are not Yoshino cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are Callery pears.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, once you hit Baltimore and
from Baltimore to probably at least
[SPEAKER_03]: Richmond, this is what I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I-95 looks like the first third of April.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly, we don't want to recreate
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to avoid this wherever we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as plant explorers and as botanic
gardens, I think one of our roles is to
[SPEAKER_03]: evaluate invasives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't shy away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something we need to
embrace and think about and take on as a
[SPEAKER_02]: role of botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little more exciting than that is
looking at hardiness and vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may think of Philadelphia as being
the banana belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really cannot grow camellias that
reliably in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some cold winters in the early
80s that wiped out most of the collections
[SPEAKER_03]: of camellias in Philadelphia and certainly
in Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from that arose a program at the
National Arboretum mainly to do camellia
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding for hardiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you think of the camellia belt
basically as Norfolk, Virginia going down
[SPEAKER_03]: the coast, the Gulf Coast, and then
California up into the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're above what might be called the
camellia belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with this in mind, in the mid-80s,
our director and some colleagues from the
[SPEAKER_03]: National Arboretum and Longwood Gardens
went to a couple islands off the coast of
[SPEAKER_03]: Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: These islands are above the 38th parallel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was politically sensitive to go
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the northernmost populations of
camellia japonica, or the common camellia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are camellia japonica growing on
those islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see, you may be able to see on the
lower left, there's a person standing
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these get to be small trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they collected a large number of seed
from three islands there.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are single red flowered camellias,
not the highly ornamental camellias.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the purpose of this was to look for
extending hardiness in zone six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we planted out about 750 of these
starting in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a couple of winters, this is what
they looked like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from those, we culled those and
they're down to about 50 plants from those
[SPEAKER_03]: original 750.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are now planted throughout the
Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We subsequently did evaluations of those
and made four selections from our plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of which is here on campus in the ILR
quad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was shown to be extra hardiness
in these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is, if you think about it,
the selections were made around 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants were collected in 84.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a generation of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the beauties of where I work,
and I think of Botanic Arts in general,
[SPEAKER_03]: is you do have that long-term horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're able to do projects that take a
whole generation to undertake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, nice glossy leaves,
single red flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are not just our selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours are the bottom four, balustrade,
bloomfield, meadowbrook, and Morris
[SPEAKER_03]: mercury, and others that came out of
Longwood Gardens, and then another Korean
[SPEAKER_03]: fire from a private individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this was a really targeted
collection that did result in improved
[SPEAKER_03]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are now commercially available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can buy these from a few
mail-order nurseries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting in the early 90s, our focus
shifted to collecting in China,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 80s, really, there was focus on
Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Politically, things got easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so China opened up, and we've really
gone on a large number of trips to China
[SPEAKER_03]: since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't done this alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We partner, as Don said, a partnership
called NACPEC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a really great, we call it a
consortium, because there's no bylaws.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a group of gardens that are
committed to this that have been working
[SPEAKER_03]: together for 25 years to collect and work
with partners in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a really great effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about China and the United
States, they are about the same landmass,
[SPEAKER_03]: roughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Large parts of China have very similar
climates to the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of areas that are easy
targets in terms of finding climatic
[SPEAKER_03]: analogs that work in, whether it's
southeastern Pennsylvania, or Boston,
[SPEAKER_03]: or Chicago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we've really targeted are a set of
mountains in central China, the Qingling
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountains, which is the continental
divide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between the Yangtze River to the north and
the Yellow River to the south.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, other way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow River to the north, Yangtze River
to the south.
[SPEAKER_03]: And collecting around the city of Xian,
which is one of the terminus of the Silk
[SPEAKER_03]: Road, the ancient capital of China,
and where you may know it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: terracotta soldiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that area has very similar climate
and great plant diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've really, as you can see,
targeted the Qingling Mountains,
[SPEAKER_03]: both from east to west.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's it mean to go to China?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have partners, and often we'll land in
Beijing and spend a couple of days just
[SPEAKER_03]: getting acclimated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 12 or 14 hour flight from Chicago
to Beijing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd need a little time to recover
from jet lag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little sightseeing in some of the
historic sites in Beijing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little horticulture browsing or
looking at some of the places.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Pinus Bungiana at one of the royal
palaces in Beijing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go to the Great Wall,
the touristy things.
[SPEAKER_03]: In recent years, we've transited to Xian
because it's closer to where we're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Xian is a fascinating place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a melting pot of cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a strong Muslim influence there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a very culturally interesting
place in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the two cities with the
remaining wall in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most cities in China have walls,
city walls.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were torn down during the Cultural
Revolution, but the one in Xian was
[SPEAKER_03]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an interesting juxtaposition
between the modern and the ancient when
[SPEAKER_03]: you visit a place like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from there, we then head out and start
to do our collecting in targeted areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, oh, last year I was there
in southern Sichuan and visited kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: again at the beginning of the trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Visited a place that is basically the
Yellow Zone of China, Huanglong Nature
[SPEAKER_03]: Preserve, which has these very interesting
travertine pools, a really remarkable
[SPEAKER_03]: place to visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I traveled the last several years with
another Cornell grad, Michael Dostman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael and I have these sort of strangely
parallel lives that have intersected at
[SPEAKER_03]: many points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've been great friends since the
mid-90s and have traveled in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are still friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a testament to something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, this was last year,
which I'll get back to in a minute,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a wonderful place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice to have at least a day or so
to acclimate and just do a little tourism
[SPEAKER_03]: before you get out into the field and
doing your collecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, partnerships are really key.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the last 10 years or so, we've worked
with the Beijing Botanic Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the right is Kang Wang, who works at
the Beijing Botanic Garden and has really
[SPEAKER_03]: been our entree into China and really has
sort of makes it all happen when we're
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also then partner with local
botanists.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2005, we worked with Professor Sun from
the Lanzhou Botanic Garden in Gansu,
[SPEAKER_03]: province of Gansu.
[SPEAKER_03]: This past year, we worked with the folks
at the Huanglong Research Station.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always good to have a local
botanist.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is someone from Chengdu Institute of
Botany in Sichuan who was with us last
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start out sort of, we'll set up
base and try and stay there for three or
[SPEAKER_03]: four days and then radiate out from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not traveling too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you drive through
countryside that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there doesn't seem to be a natural
plant as far as the eye can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sort of wonder where something
that we're targeted in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this side is a couple years old,
but you still see this just this terraced
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture is pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many machines up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some ways, it's like traveling back
in time when you visit these very rural
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, you hit the end of the road
and then start hiking up and doing your
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we try and find these forest cuts
where the seed is actually lower on the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants where it might be able to reach the
seed on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things, as I said,
that we've been trying to do is looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: species conservation and using botanic
gardens as a model for species
[SPEAKER_03]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, in terms of capturing enough
diversity that you can actually do some
[SPEAKER_03]: conservation in the garden, but then also
collecting unusual and rare species as
[SPEAKER_03]: demonstrations and as educational
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been focusing on maples as one of
our groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're part of the APGA's Plant
Collections Network along with Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: Botanic Gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're one of the multi-site holders of
maples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last few years, this has been one
of my great interests in building our
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've collected things that look,
you know, you think of as maples,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is Acer singlingense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks a lot like a sugar maple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then things that don't really look
very maple like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That yellow shrubby plant in the mid
ground is Acer stachyophyllum,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a high elevation Chinese species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't look very maple like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually related to Acer spicatum if
you know that native species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one is Acer pectinatum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you know, looks somewhat maple
like, but kind of stretches what you think
[SPEAKER_03]: of as a typical maple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly the samaras give it off
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a recent collection is something
that hadn't been in the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: Acer trichodatum, which is related to Acer
platanoides, a plant that wasn't in
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I think it's best used as a
teaching tool to talk about plant
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: A very interesting and beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something, you know, sometimes
you come across things that are familiar,
[SPEAKER_03]: but perhaps in their native setting don't
seem that familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a plant that I've seen all
over, not all over, but seen relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: commonly here on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone know what this is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan?
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is Acer griseum, growing in the
wild, which you may not think of,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, there it is growing
basically out of a rock face here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about 2010, this publication came out,
The Red List of Maples, and what's on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cover?
[SPEAKER_03]: Acer griseum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was an epiphany for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized at this point that Acer griseum
is an endangered species in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, I wouldn't say common,
but it's a well-loved garden plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a wonderful garden plant,
but in its native habitat, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: endangered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly through habitat fragmentation and,
you know, reproduction, reproductive
[SPEAKER_03]: barriers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started a project to look at how
much genetic diversity is in cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: and whether or not that captures the
genetic diversity of plants in the wild or
[SPEAKER_03]: whether further conservation efforts need
to be made.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially how many pandas,
how many Acer griseums do you need in
[SPEAKER_03]: captivity to capture the genetic diversity
of the wild, if the pandas or the Acer
[SPEAKER_03]: griseum were to go extinct?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the native range of paperbark
maple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, if you don't know this plant,
it's a wonderful garden plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has this great exfoliating bark,
fabulous fall color, and a plant of many,
[SPEAKER_03]: many interests throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, you know, one of my favorite
garden plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The known collections in the United States
only come from a relatively restricted
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the range.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this kind of reinforced our hypothesis
that perhaps what's in cultivation is just
[SPEAKER_03]: a fragment or a segment of the greater
diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we decided to do starting in 2013
was to sample known wild collected plants
[SPEAKER_03]: in the United States at these locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then folks at the Morton Arboretum
were doing the molecular analysis of
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if there's any molecular biologists
in here, I'm going to have to pass on the
[SPEAKER_03]: questions, but I sort of know the general
concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we collected the United States and then
in 2014 went to England and collected from
[SPEAKER_03]: old known wild collected trees throughout
England, Scotland, and Wales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here's the national champion Acer
griseum in Wales with my friend Chris
[SPEAKER_03]: Bachtell from the Morton Arboretum in
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in 2015 Chris Bachtell,
Michael Kang, and I went to China to
[SPEAKER_03]: collect across the range of Acer griseum
in China and taking leaf samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we traveled within a 500 mile radius of
Xi'an.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to give you some perspective,
we traveled about 1600 miles in two weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: which a 500 mile radius of Philadelphia or
Denver gives you some idea of the area in
[SPEAKER_03]: which we traveled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the topography was probably more
like Denver than it was like Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as I said, here were the known
collections previously in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were taking leaf samples and wherever
we could seed, there was only two places
[SPEAKER_03]: we saw seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we tried to cover as much of the
known range as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So comparing the two, we really expanded
the range of collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to give you another example of
where we collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think we feel that we've well
sampled the range.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one population that we couldn't
find, but we feel like we have a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good handle on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably the most impressive tree we
saw was one that a colleague had seen in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1995.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tree growing outside of a
village in southern Shaanxi province.
[SPEAKER_03]: And colleagues of ours had seen this,
had made notes and had GPS readings of
[SPEAKER_03]: where this was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to go back and look at
their notes and go right back to that
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really speaks to this idea of
keeping good records.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things about collecting in
the field and being a botanic garden is
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping good records.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a great testimony that we were
able to go right back to that spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Morton Arboretum doing this work
has been able to construct this molecular
[SPEAKER_03]: tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the main thing I want to point out is
the blue center where it says Hubei Wilson
[SPEAKER_03]: 1901.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all the plants in cultivation
from the United States and from England.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, everything that we've
sampled in cultivation came from a
[SPEAKER_03]: collection that E.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilson made in 1901.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we call a genetic
bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, everything in cultivation is
one seed collection, supposedly 100 trees,
[SPEAKER_03]: germinated then, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see in comparison,
the other populations that we've sampled,
[SPEAKER_03]: the northern populations in China are on
the top, and then the more subtly
[SPEAKER_03]: populations are on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from this data, it looks like we're not
well capturing what's in cultivation right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one missing piece of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a major nursery on the West Coast
in Oregon, heritage seedlings,
[SPEAKER_03]: that grows something to the tune of 40
thousand acergrisium a year and sells,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just grows, but sells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've sampled those and they're not
included in these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last question is, do they have
anything else that's not shown on this
[SPEAKER_03]: slide?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once those data are back,
we'll have the full picture and we'll know
[SPEAKER_03]: which populations we need to target for
preservation in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next steps are to work with our
Chinese colleagues to do NC2 and XC2
[SPEAKER_03]: conservation of some of those more
threatened populations in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this project's been a really exciting
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taken about four years now and it's
been a really gratifying project.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally taken me around the world
and really been a fun and interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving on, talking a little bit about
insect and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So living in Ithaca, certainly you know
Canada Hemlock, which is sort of a
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful forest species.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most recent map I could find
of the spread of Hemlock woolly adelgid
[SPEAKER_03]: and it does seem to be creeping up into
this part of central New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a problem in Philadelphia for 25
or more years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it basically saps the strength of the
Hemlocks to the point where they're very
[SPEAKER_03]: thin and weak and eventually succumb to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they can sort of limp along with
Hemlock woolly adelgid, but they really,
[SPEAKER_03]: from an ecological point of view and from
an ornamental view, they really lose their
[SPEAKER_03]: value either in the wild or in the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chinese Hemlock appears to be resistant to
Hemlock woolly adelgid.
[SPEAKER_03]: The adelgid that is the invasive one is a
Japanese insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up until the mid-90s, there had been two
collections of Chinese Hemlock and really
[SPEAKER_03]: two trees in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, a real genetic bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we wanted to look at increasing the
diversity for hybridization work and for
[SPEAKER_03]: evaluation work, we targeted Chinese
Hemlock and have made a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: collections in central New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Central China since the mid-90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Chris Bachtell with the collection
in 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things we do, as I said,
when we're doing these collections,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still living in the pencil and paper
world, takes scrupulous notes so that
[SPEAKER_03]: people in 20 or 50 years know where we
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take herbarium specimens, which are
deposited in various herbaria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we spend our time in the nights and
evenings cleaning seed and getting ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to package the seed and bring it back to
the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we generally collect seed because if
you think about it, 100 acorns have a
[SPEAKER_03]: great deal of diversity and they're really
transportable.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you try and bring back 100 oak
seedlings, it's very, very challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a seed basically is prepackaged to
travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole point of seed is
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes our lives a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are very meticulous about
cleaning and packaging our seed and making
[SPEAKER_03]: sure we get it in appropriately and with
all the appropriate permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are packing up at the end of
one trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the really exciting part is when
you see them germinate in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are Suga chinensis that we collected
in 2005 and then growing on in your
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse and then eventually planted in
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the fulfilling part.
[SPEAKER_03]: With some of these collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're actually at the stage with the
Chinese hemlock where we have a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: collections in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're evaluating them for horticultural
traits and we're actually working on
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation both vegetatively and through
seed to try and get some nursery folks
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in growing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is again a 20 to 25 year process
from inception through propagation and
[SPEAKER_03]: seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been another good example of how
botanic gardens can function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again talking about insect and disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably all know about the emerald
ash borer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how close it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very close to Tompkins County.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an insect introduced from northern
China into Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kills ashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be all native ashes by
creating these galleries in the cambium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it started out in the Detroit Windsor
Canada area and has spread very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go through these slides quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the last 12 years or so across the
northeastern United States and just keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: spreading.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's finally reached Philadelphia about
three or four years ago and you can see it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't seem to have any boundaries or any
limits so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the most recent map is September
2007 and you can see it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: encircling, it seems to be going down the
Erie Canal or highway 80, no not 80,
[SPEAKER_03]: 90 and then inching its way up from
Connecticut as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said it affects all native ashes,
American ash which has a wide native range
[SPEAKER_03]: and widely planted horticulturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green ash, fraction is Pennsylvania,
has an even wider native range and if you
[SPEAKER_03]: live in the Dakotas or in Montana it's one
of your primary street trees even if you
[SPEAKER_03]: live in Chicago or Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So huge economic and biological impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is sort of the scene you might
see in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my wife's cousin's college in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it affects everybody where it's really
having a big impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows about this, not just
horticulturists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are slides from Dan Herms at
Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is taken in Toledo, Ohio,
sort of a before and after shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are huge implications for this in
many, many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stormwater runoff, heating and cooling
costs, removal costs, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are many nurseries that
basically had to tear out their nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Hinsdale Nursery, a big nursery
outside of Chicago, destroying all their
[SPEAKER_03]: ashes about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with this in mind, starting around 2008
we decided to go to China and collect a
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity of ash species.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was very little Asian ash in the
United States so the idea was to collect,
[SPEAKER_03]: expand the number of species, get them in
the hands of people who were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: research on this and look for any inherent
resistance and any potential for breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we realized quickly that there were no
ash experts and we became the ash experts
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of on the fly when we were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we collected, starting in 2008 and
going up until the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_03]: a number of different species and I'll
just touch on a couple of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fraxinus manchurica, which is essentially
the green ash of China.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets to be a large tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a timber tree there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be some resistance here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are collecting those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fraxinus insularis is a medium size tree,
previously not known in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows along stream beds so perhaps
might be a good urban tree and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: get too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has some potential as a urban
tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The green tree on the left is Fraxinus
insularis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another tree, Fraxinus chinensis,
which is sort of a small ash tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, this chinensis has a very
similar range to the emerald ash borer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there is any inherent resistance,
Fraxinus chinensis might have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are collecting some along the
roadside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were growing on at the Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten them into hands of
researchers in Ohio and in Michigan who
[SPEAKER_03]: are doing work on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really a way we can serve as a
conduit to get material into the USDA and
[SPEAKER_03]: into the Forest Service system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to talk a little bit about
traveling in China because it's part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole experience and it's sort of an
immersion in economic botany in and of
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is still sort of what you see when
you're there, a day in the life of
[SPEAKER_03]: traveling in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might come across roads like this or
something like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've never been more terrified than
driving in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try not to tell my wife or show my wife
some of these slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just sort of look out the window and
hold your breath when you're in these
[SPEAKER_03]: situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see all kinds of crazy things when
you're driving around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure whose idea this was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get out and fix the road while
you're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as I said, you sort of encounter
this, you're immersed in a world of
[SPEAKER_03]: economic botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this woman is drawing Pinus armandii
cones, which is used as a pine nut and
[SPEAKER_03]: widely used as a nut like Pinus edulis or
the other pine nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a woman cracking these
and boiling these, sort of like buying
[SPEAKER_03]: boiled peanuts in the South.
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy boiled pine nuts as you're
traveling through.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was outside of Xi'an.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another roadside stop,
as I said, was just sort of this wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: example of economic botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: In central, near Xi'an, there's a lot of
kiwi production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kiwi is really the Chinese gooseberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the New Zealanders started to
grow it and call it kiwi, but it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: native to China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the world's production for
juice comes from this part of China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's locally grown kiwis,
plums, apples, two kinds of walnuts,
[SPEAKER_03]: the English walnut and Chinese walnut on
the left, chestnuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of a whole bounty of locally
grown things growing by the side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just sort of experiencing the
different architecture and different
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects of culture is pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a lot of coal being burned,
so I won't make any political comments
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you still see coal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our hotel, which sort of mimicked
the local architecture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even being in cities is pretty
fascinating to see the markets and just
[SPEAKER_03]: see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the cities and what goes on on the
street.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think because a lot of homes in China
are small, there's a very vibrant street
[SPEAKER_03]: life, which is really pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can have your keys made at the
local key maker there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have your things mended by the
local seamstress out on the street and so
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite shops was the spice
shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was basically could pick out your
blend of spices for hot pot and they had
[SPEAKER_03]: their sort of house blend and then you
could pick out and make your own from the
[SPEAKER_03]: various things that are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my favorite shop, I love chili
peppers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the local chili pepper shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the grinder in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what it's like to work
here, but it certainly was an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: place to visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, wonderful street food
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This woman has become sort of our
unofficial noodle shop in Xi'an.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the name like Tony Aiello, I've been
eating noodles, you know, pretty much my
[SPEAKER_03]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are, you know, among the best bowls
of noodles I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so every time we're there,
we go back and this is a coal fired stove.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little scary, but a delicious meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's just really interesting to
see hand pulled noodles.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well, and I make my homemade pasta
pretty regularly, but I don't do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even after a while, you get a little
tired of eating noodles, three meals a
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what happens after a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to skip a couple,
skip ahead for one second to skip through
[SPEAKER_03]: these, because I want to focus on
something that we've done in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll wrap up with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have done a fair amount of
collecting in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2012, again, Michael Dostman and I
had this idea of collecting live oak,
[SPEAKER_03]: Quercus virginina, at the northern limit
of its range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we had, in the whole history of
the Morris Arboretum, we've had two plants
[SPEAKER_03]: of live oak in the 1950s, which never made
out of the seedling beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Arnold Arboretum has never had
live oak in their collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought, well, why don't we go to
the northern limit of the range,
[SPEAKER_03]: both wild populations and cultivated
plants, collect acorns, bring them back,
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them on, and see if there's any
inherent hardiness among them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with climate change, perhaps this may
be a plant of the future, even in
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this slide shows in light green the
native range of live oak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see in far southeastern
Virginia, one little bright green county.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does get up into southeastern
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually crosses over into the
Delmarva Peninsula.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made a number of collections,
as I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another slide showing its native
range.
[SPEAKER_03]: The red dots show it in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made collections starting in Richmond
and then going down to the coast in
[SPEAKER_03]: Virginia Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both Michael and I are northern boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really know much about live oak.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we made a number of collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is at a park in Richmond.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a tree there in the center,
which has been there probably for about
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Richmond may be a tad bit warmer than
Philadelphia, but pretty comparable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought if this tree has survived
for 100 years in this park, then maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: there's something to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also collected at Williamsburg some
trees there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, as I said, in Virginia
Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we're taking notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we're in cultivated areas,
we're taking notes and keeping track of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're collecting using the same
processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as I said, going down here,
collecting at William and Mary and then in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colonial Williamsburg itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think these trees were collected
locally and planted there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've been there, again,
going on 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably a little bit, well,
it's definitely warmer there than even in
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, just sort of testing that
provenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, ending at one of the
northernmost populations in Virginia
[SPEAKER_03]: Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, Virginia, this is a place called
First Landing State Park, a fascinating
[SPEAKER_03]: state park.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes from the coast, a dunal ecology on
the coast, to a bald cypress swamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are seven ecotypes in this one state
park.
[SPEAKER_03]: A really fascinating place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also the northernmost population of
Tillandsia, Spanish moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we didn't collect that, but we were
tempted to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here you can see, Michael,
on the right, is a live oak growing on the
[SPEAKER_03]: beach, the darker green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the sort of middle,
to his left, is Quercus incana,
[SPEAKER_03]: another oak growing on the dunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, a very drought tolerant
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's some very old live oaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how old these are,
but they're Stoleniferous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this organism, this plant, is probably
150 years old, if not older.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we brought them back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same kind of process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had really good germination of them
and lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We overwintered them in a somewhat heated
greenhouse and an unheated polyhouse to
[SPEAKER_03]: see if there's any effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just last fall, you can see some
in the spring, some leaf damage,
[SPEAKER_03]: even at 34 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we threw those plants out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here they are again, a winter in
the polyhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, some damage, and so those plants
get tossed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Planted them out this past fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've had one not very cold winter in
Philadelphia out in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're waiting to see what happens
over the next couple of winters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of in the early stages of
evaluations of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: But perhaps in 50 years, live oaks will
line the entrance to the Morris Arboretum
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of Magnolias.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have to wait and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I'm happy to take any
questions in the couple of minutes that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were those purple plums in the market
Europeans or diploids?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have known.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look more like Europeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have been, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem pretty large.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they seem like what I think of as a
plum that we get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think they were any sort of
land race or anything really unusual.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions from Mexico?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find any resistance to the hemlock
woolly adelgid in those hemlocks that you
[SPEAKER_01]: brought back from China?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Chinese hemlock seems to have
great resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say total resistance,
but it seems to have great resistance to
[SPEAKER_03]: hemlock woolly adelgid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does get some of the Fiorina scale,
but not on the same level as our native
[SPEAKER_03]: hemlock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been evaluating it for 25 years
actively and really have not seen any
[SPEAKER_03]: impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some work done by a graduate
student at Yale looking at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, the woolly adelgid that we
have is Japanese and affects Japanese
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are woolly adelgids in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: That affect the Chinese species,
but those haven't been important to the
[SPEAKER_03]: US.
[SPEAKER_02]: To follow up on Sonia's question,
what is the potential value of introducing
[SPEAKER_02]: a Chinese hemlock or a Chinese ash or its
cultivars into the US in terms of our
[SPEAKER_02]: native forest ecology?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's an interesting and pretty
complex question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think from a horticultural point of
view, I think there's great potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it gets a lot muddier and more
difficult to sort of tease out when you
[SPEAKER_03]: think about whether or not you should use
these for naturalization or for
[SPEAKER_03]: reforestation in natural areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's sort of the question with the
American chestnut, even though it's 15,
[SPEAKER_03]: 16, so 31, 30 seconds American chestnut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that truly an American chestnut or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think my approach has really been
more from a horticultural point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when you get into kind of
restoration work, it gets a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have a good answer to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of the grad students have a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When evaluating invasiveness, do you look
at the roots influences on the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen dynamics or do you look more at
compatibility and the speed of the
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling growth?
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably more at the seedling growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, what do we evaluate
when we look at potential invasiveness?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing we look at is how it
behaves in China or in the wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we look at how well it germinates
in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it germinates really, really well,
we're excited by that because it's great
[SPEAKER_03]: to have a lot of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is also kind of a warning sign at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if it gets through those filters,
so to speak, we'll plant them out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden and watch them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And gardeners hate to pull weeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So gardeners don't like weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if something starts to seed in,
the gardeners at the arboretum or wherever
[SPEAKER_03]: they are, the first sort of line of people
who tell us about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there have been a few cases where we've
actively had things in the garden that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've eliminated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really more through the lifecycle
as much as anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had collected in 2015, there was a
hydrangea aspera that we're very excited
[SPEAKER_03]: to collect in Sichuan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought it back and had incredible seed
germination, which was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I happened to be in China again last year
in 2016 and saw this hydrangea everywhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: on roadsides everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the kind of thing that makes you
think, well, OK, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems very adaptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It germinates very readily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we really need to keep an eye on
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nina?
[SPEAKER_00]: So has there been a problem getting suga
chinensis into the nursery trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been talking about it with
nursery folks, and no one's picking it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, the challenge is to
getting the nursery trade to grow suga
[SPEAKER_03]: chinensis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had the same experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sent cuttings to a nursery on the West
Coast who was able to root them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow them really well, climb out
there so much better, and produce these
[SPEAKER_03]: great plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he sent us his dregs of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had, I forget how many,
a couple hundred plants from the cuttings
[SPEAKER_03]: we sent him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't know what to do with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because on the West Coast, they don't know
anything about hemlock woolly adelgid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was essentially going to trash these
really nice Chinese hemlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I told him, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll find some nurseries on the East
Coast that'll buy them from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's one of those challenges
that are really hard to overcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure what it is, because I
think there is a market out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if a couple people start doing it,
maybe it will catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to folks who said,
where's the source that I get them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some seed sources that you can
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they germinate easily from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who has seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm always happy to send cuttings to
people, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, I want to thank Tony for
an absolutely fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
