University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the garden of the McEvoy
Educational Center, three Cornellians came
[SPEAKER_00]: to build a piece of community-minded
living sculpture with students.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start the planning process,
they made a list of goals for the project,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone agreed creating a private and
quiet shaded space would draw community
[SPEAKER_00]: members to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: To create this contemplative space,
they built this tunnel and dome from
[SPEAKER_00]: willow and dogwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The design of these pieces is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dome sits within the curve of the
twisting tunnel, and the entire space is
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to maximize people's interactions
with the sculptures.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the layout of this piece is
interesting, this sculpture is seen better
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tunnel was created using cuttings of
willow and dogwood, which were planted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground in the hopes that they would
grow roots and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a difficult practice because fresh
cuttings require a lot of water and care
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to become established.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more successful parts of the tunnel
are made from willows like this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has survived because of its thicker
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the strengths of living sculpture
is the adaptability of its components.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this project may not have turned out
as planned, this tunnel and dome are still
[SPEAKER_00]: effective because plants like this bean
vine and these sunflowers are growing to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill in the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be frustrating to work with living
materials, but every project has the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to grow into something new.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
