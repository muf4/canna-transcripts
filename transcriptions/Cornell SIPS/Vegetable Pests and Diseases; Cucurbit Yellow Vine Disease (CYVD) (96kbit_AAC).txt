[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Kenzie Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PhD student at Cornell and I'm
with... Hi, I'm Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a professor of vegetable pathology at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today our video is about diseases of
cucurbit and today we will talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: cucurbit yellowbine disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kenzie, what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a squash plant and we have here
some of the, one of the diseases that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just found a couple of years ago here at
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see here some of the scorching
margins and there is also some jellowing
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaves if you can check it out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is called cucurbit yellowbine
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this bacteria is transmitted by the
squash bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So previously the squash bug is known as a
pest, was known as a pest, but it was not
[SPEAKER_01]: known to transmit any disease,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to know this
because now the squash bug, it's a threat
[SPEAKER_01]: to transmit this disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see here in the plant,
we can see some of the neem of the squash
[SPEAKER_01]: bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the squash bug life cycle, it has some
neems and then it can become a senado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can also see here some eggs and
these eggs will hatch and we become like
[SPEAKER_01]: these neems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here like two stages of
the neems.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the smaller ones that are the
ones that hatch and look like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will become bigger and they
will get this like grayish color later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will grow and they will become an
adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not all the squash bugs can bring
the disease because like they have it in
[SPEAKER_01]: their guts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if one squash bug have the disease or
have the bacteria in it and will feed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, then the bacteria probably will
get into the plant and the plant will get
[SPEAKER_01]: disease eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does a squash bug have to feed on every
leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that how the plant dies or does the
bacteria move in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually the squash bug have to,
the squash bug feed in every part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but for the bacteria to be
transmitted, it has to feed in the phloem
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to feed in every leaf
as long as they can feed in the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mainly the disease will start the
crown because the bacteria just like can
[SPEAKER_01]: feed, can be in the phloem and this will
clog the phloem of the plant and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: create this yellow that we see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually what happens is that since the
bacteria is clogging the phloem,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will get this yellowish because the
nutrients are not getting into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as it will be if the plant will be
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so it's like you're clogging the veins
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main thing is to control the squash
bug or manage the squash bug because once
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria is seen, it's hard to
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the main things is getting rid
of the squash bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it manually, maybe removing some
eggs that we see in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we can also remove the adults that we
see because the adult can overwinter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to scout the field at
the beginning of the season to see if we
[SPEAKER_01]: can see some adults and take them out of
the field and be on the lookout during the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole season for the eggs, for the neems
and also for the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant looks to be a pumpkin or
winter squash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it go to all the squashes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it go to other cucurbits like melons
or cucumbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these disease can be seen in zucchini,
in watermelon, in squash, winter squash,
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have seen if we plant different
species or varieties of these ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will see that they mostly like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the squash bug preference is mostly
seen in winter squash, in zucchinis,
[SPEAKER_01]: in acorn squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will probably see that this is more
present in these varieties or these
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, but it also can go to
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you just have watermelon or even
cantaloupe, you will see that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: there probably too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, so it depends on which plant the
squash bug likes the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's mostly dependent on what squash
bug like the best because as we said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the squash bug is the one that transmit
the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more squash bug the higher the
probability that you will see that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: in that specific plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the squash bug start reproducing,
you will see like thousands and thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of eggs and neems in only one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will highly increase the chances
for you to get in the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this disease get into the
plant every year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does it live in the soil or does it
come in on the seeds that we plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mostly know that the squash bug is
the one that can keep the disease in their
[SPEAKER_01]: gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the squash bug will overwinter with the
disease in their gut and then with the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in their gut, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whenever the new season starts
and the adults start coming in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will be the one that will feed and
will transmit the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will also see that it will leave
some leftovers of the plant that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting, whether it's a pumpkin,
that might be an overwinter site too for
[SPEAKER_01]: the squash bug and the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to try to clean
your garden or your field at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important that you get rid of
all the, let's say all the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you already harvest and you have like
the leftover plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that we get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make sure that at least we keep the
population of squash bug low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kenzie, I know you're doing your
research in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that you'll be able to help
the farmers in the state of New York
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of their plants dying
from this bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited for this because I am
trying to determine what is the preference
[SPEAKER_01]: of the squash bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of now, we are trying to have
different varieties and cultivars to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the most preferred by the squash
bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will be working with doing
some screenings to see if there are
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that are less likely to have a
lot of squash bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also want to determine where the
disease is in the state, Chris,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know a lot about the disease here
in New York because we just reported the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are really hopeful that we will be
able also to determine or detect the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease because sometimes it's confused
with other diseases or people think that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have like nutrient deficiency in
their field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually what they have is the disease
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think diagnostics is one of the first
thing that we have to focus on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the symptoms can be really similar
to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good luck getting identifying plants
that are more resistant to this
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to check out more about
this disease, we will have more
[SPEAKER_01]: information available in the Cornell
vegetable website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
