[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to thank you, to thank my
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what our group meetings looked
like on the left side of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either cubby holes or meeting in
Central Park when the situation seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate before the next variant showed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, particularly, I wanted to
highlight the individuals here who
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kimberly Gibson, Dolly, and Stephanie
Zullo are students of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now off to better things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viviana Medina is a student of Matthew
Gilbert, Dean of Physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Santos Barreira, who also contributed
to a few of the slides, was a longtime
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher at Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he then recently obtained his PhD at
the University of Nebraska in a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will, this is kind of a brief
overview of my program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to outline that my talk is
that it's well-timed because the ICCP or
[SPEAKER_00]: IPCC came with that latest report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's as troublesome as ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't seem to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to talk about,
briefly introduce the topic that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to include and speed up germ plasmid
utilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I think that a lot of people
are doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the target seems to be ever more
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll introduce then the model I'm talking
about, which is inspired by research on
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication hotspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seven domestications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two of these domesticate are
tepary bean and lima bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may help us in this dire
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll end with a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clear that we have been putting
out CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a rate that is not slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this in the left part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, we have benefited, and this is
the domestication work that shows,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a relatively stable climate for the
last 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And except then, but to the right at the
end, you see an ever-increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue will not go away, even if we
were to stop right now all the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions and other greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two curves here, this is the
emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take the best-case scenario,
where we stop all the emissions as fast as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, the light blue line here,
the CO2 content of the atmosphere is
[SPEAKER_00]: barely going to decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are set with a continued,
continually heated climate all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the consequences also.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, people have said,
well, where is this global climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as recently, I think there was an
article in the New York Times that
[SPEAKER_00]: questioned that to stay out of US
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The French president said, you have never
told us that we were going to be faced
[SPEAKER_00]: with these catastrophes and so on,
upon which the French media put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: clip where they listed almost several
instances dating back to the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they said, hey, we are faced with
global climate change and certainly global
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give a recent example here,
at the left, this is what the situation in
[SPEAKER_00]: California in September of last year,
not very long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the situation now in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a radical change in terms of
the drought status.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a drought improvement of the
drought status in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are expecting another atmospheric
river this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to affect mostly central
and southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say that this is a consequence of
global warming to the people of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we deal with this heating and
this irregular precipitation?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be faced with drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to simplify, because it's going
to come back later on, there are at least
[SPEAKER_00]: two types, major types of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the one in the middle,
intermittent drought, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: irregular rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the crops have to be faced with
sufficient water, insufficient water,
[SPEAKER_00]: in succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the bottom, you see the
terminal drought, where the crop is grown
[SPEAKER_00]: as a consequence or based on the residual
moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we talk about drought,
we have to at least define these two big
[SPEAKER_00]: classes of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will talk mostly about the two,
the intermittent drought and the permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should point out that this is from a
work by Fisher who was talking about rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an issue that goes across
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the second theme is that we have
these gene banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been established all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA has an important germplasm system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it's probably the biggest
and if not the most successful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one limitation is the use of it to the
lack of there are and also the speed at
[SPEAKER_00]: which we use these accessions in a gene
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will focus primarily here on this
aspect here, the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get it into the current breeding
cycles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've been working on phase aeolus for
quite some time, starting at the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the gene bank in Seattle, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the predictions here is, you see here,
this is a work of Ramirez Caral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shows the optimum versus less
optimum areas in principally, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: here in South America and in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highlight these regions because they
are so important in the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the people haven't eaten beans,
they probably think they haven't eaten at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's beans and rice, beans and maize,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we look at the prediction for the
future in the Americas and in Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that the suitable area,
which is the green area, is shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the current materials and in the
current way of growing these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an incentive, actually,
to look what can we do when faced with
[SPEAKER_00]: this heat, increased heat, and also the
irregularity of the precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genus phase aeolus itself has five
domesticated species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been known for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have common bean, which is by far the
most important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have runner bean, which is a close
relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the so-called year bean,
which is the least known of the five
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predominantly in Central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also then have these two other
species, tepary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lima bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have found is that two of those
species have been domesticated twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common bean in Mexico and in the southern
Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lima bean, again, in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Andes, but in a very restricted
area on the western slope of the Andes in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecuador and northern Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, that area also has
these wild common bean, but those were not
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an altitude difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lima bean is on the lower altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And common bean is at a higher altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's almost like people made a
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they domesticated lima bean rather
than common bean in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that people
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated these different species?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see on the screen is the
distribution of the wild ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the left, you see common bean has the
broader distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lima bean is close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it involves this migration in both
species from the area of origin of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genus to Central America, and then most
importantly, to the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several break points that
are naturally determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lima bean has pretty much the same
distribution, but in terms of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relatedness, it's somewhat different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have runner bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this tepary bean, which is
concentrated in, you could say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the northwest quadrant of Mexico and also
the southwest of the US, principally
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the year bean has a very narrow
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wild ancestor in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably caused because of the
fact that it's a hybrid, a stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid between runner bean and common
bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the three gene pools in
common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red one and the blue one have been
domesticated, not the yellow one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, again, the seven
domestications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see at the top row is the wild
relative, a very small seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's camouflaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next row are the domesticated
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a tremendous change in size
and color and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that differentiates them is
their adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important species here,
common bean, and I say economically at
[SPEAKER_00]: this stage, is growing in an intermediate
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too hot, not too cold, not too dry,
not too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left of it are the species that are
adapted to a cooler or humid environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which on the face of it might not be
useful in a scenario of global climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to plant earlier to adapt these
species to global warming, maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have to plant earlier into a cooler
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not that they are not useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, we don't concentrate on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, you have lima bean and
tepari bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are adapted to drier and hotter
climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the case for tepari bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lima bean, this is a species with the
broadest adaptation in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect that we have studied is the
domestication syndrome, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological differences and
physiological differences between wild and
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated types in common bean mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I emphasize these traits because they
are still useful today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a matter of the past 10,000
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They affect the productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The productivity and the quality of these
crops even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a number of characters here for
seed and pot colors and weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing the color is extremely important
in terms of consumer acceptability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not the right color, people will
not accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not just talking about red or
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a particular shade of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a particular shade of yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumer, especially in the
Americas, less so in Africa, are
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely, how would I say, recognizing
picky, if I could say, about the color of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first actually character of
domestication that we identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene for domestication was the
determinacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which creates a bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, actually the gene responsible
is a homolog of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has three copies in the genome,
in the bean genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is where most of the
mutations, the loss of function mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: for these genes were identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also, we took care of the
opportunity in order to demonstrate that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really the gene, we transformed
Arabidopsis with a functional allele of
[SPEAKER_00]: the homolog in beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to restore the wild type,
the phenotype, in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene is important in the bush
production of green beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it shortens the flowering time and
making harvest easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the period sensitivity, you will see,
is tremendously important, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of germplasm utilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genophysiolus is a semi-tropical genus
adapted to short days or long nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we plant them in temperate areas,
many of these exceptions don't flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it affects utilization, the screening
of germplasm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two genes that have been
identified based on the materials that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by Jim Weller in Australia and Martha
Santaya in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed dormancy is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to do with the permeability of
the seed growth and decomposition in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of waxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more recently, Travis Parker,
who is a student and now postdoc and now
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher at Davis, studied the
development of the pod during
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first step was to eliminate or
reduce pod shattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a trait that is still
important today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also then studied the absence of
threads or strings, people call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about string beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the modern green beans don't have a
string.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to figure out what the
locus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, again, a homolog of Arabidopsis in
the Hising gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that locus, the stringless beans have a
duplication combined with an insertion of
[SPEAKER_00]: a retrotransposon in between the two
copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That creates an increased expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it eliminates the string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the same time, this duplication
creates an instability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through an equal recombination,
you can revert at a high frequency about
[SPEAKER_00]: one in 1,000, and you can revert to the
string state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are still looking at what is,
how can we deal with this to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a major issue in terms of quality
control and maintenance of genetic stocks
[SPEAKER_00]: in the green bean industry, the production
of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they spent some kind of $50,000,
we don't know for sure, trying to guess
[SPEAKER_00]: every year, just because they have to send
down people through the fields to rogue
[SPEAKER_00]: the revertence.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, these revertence are
excellent isogenic lines, because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the original state and the revertence
state in an isogenic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are sequencing them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it illustrates how these
domestication traits are still important
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions is, what is the
equivalent of these genes, the homolog,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these other phasiolic domesticated
species?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to introduce tepary bean to you
and lima bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the seedlings you see in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the left is a tepary bean seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a lima bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the left, you see common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the right is tepary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very branched growth habit,
prostrate, hugging the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that it's part maybe of the
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the same thing in common bean in
the ecogeographic race Durango from
[SPEAKER_00]: northern Mexico, where it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have this prostrate habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, interestingly, in the Andean
domestication race, Chile also has these
[SPEAKER_00]: prostrate growing habits, presumably
because of that dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a difference in the
earliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the left, you see common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry patches are these mature,
senesced tepary beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to the right here is lima bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are differences in the average
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, tepary bean is the shortest
cycle, which is part of that tolerance to
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to run your cycle as quickly as
possible to escape the droughts at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the seeds look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale here is centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are photos of the gene bank of Cia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It systematically takes photos of the
seeds and the pods of their holdings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, overall, the seeds are fairly
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is an issue with the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gene banks, you have the USDA as
holdings, the Cia illery in Africa as a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that branched growth habits
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also Australia and Brawa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the wild types, the orange dots
there are distributed, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the northwest quadrant of Mexico,
but also spilling over into Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the domesticated types in purple
have a slightly broader distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not that broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are differences among the
wild populations in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have types here near the stream,
edges, but then going up the slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their leaves also change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are at the slopes are in dry
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have smaller leaves, so smaller
evaporative surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a collaborative trial with Cia
and Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carlos Urea, who is the bean breeder in
the panhandle in western Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And myself and Jorge Berni is a student
here in Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Santos Barera is the person from Cia,
who was kind of central to these
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then heat stress trials here were
conducted then both in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The university has these really
unappreciated series of experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: stationed kind of north, south,
in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have very diverse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One here is at the so-called Desert
Research and Extension Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's near the border with Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, it's, quote, stinking hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have done a preliminary experiment
growing common bean, lima bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: and temporary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common bean was killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only two species that survived
were lima bean and temporary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have done a preliminary experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they also conducted experiments
in Colombia, the northern coast near the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean, very hot and humid this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Alvarado in one of the valleys of
the Magdalena River, which can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results of this analysis,
then, if you compare, UC Davis and another
[SPEAKER_00]: station west, the West Side Research and
Extension Center, the three species here,
[SPEAKER_00]: common bean, temporary bean, and lima
bean, are color-coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the green ones are common
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph then shows well-irrigated
and drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a fairly good correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But common bean is the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adapted to this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then comes lima bean in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in blue is temporary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, there are tremendous marked
species differences, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: intra-specific differences in their
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will highlight here these tep varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually bred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not just germplasm lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tep is actually a product led by Tim
Porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know Tim Porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a graduate of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows, on one hand, that,
yes, we can use the land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: But breeding will add to the tolerance of
this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been almost no breeding in that
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MET stands for multi-environment
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see here an analysis just of
temporary bean under heat stress and under
[SPEAKER_00]: drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two combine a fairly high
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these tep materials come out on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is room for breeding in this
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing here, where you look at
the yield, which the improved lines figure
[SPEAKER_00]: here as the highest yielders in this
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that is interesting
here is that at each of these locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow them under drought and the well
water conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might ask, well, how do they group
these locations and these treatments?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say, well, all the drought
stressed materials group on one side and
[SPEAKER_00]: the well watered on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it going to be grouped according to
location?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what turns out is that they group
rather based on location rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment within location.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it suggests that we don't
completely know what is adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treat them here in terms of,
broadly speaking, the general temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the general rainfall, or the amount of
water supplied during the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be other characters involved in
adaptation besides these few simple ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that really differentiates
these locations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here is this is UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Alvarado in Colombia, high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Palmira, also in Colombia,
drought and irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here the pattern that the
different treatments tend to group
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really separated by location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a new observation really,
but it raises that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, tepary bean has been of interest to
people in common bean because they see it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a source of genetic diversity,
and particularly resistance to common
[SPEAKER_00]: bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance to common bacterial blight in
common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and people have developed over
about, I would say, 20, 25 years from near
[SPEAKER_00]: absence of resistance in common bean to
fairly high levels of resistance by
[SPEAKER_00]: combining different sources, including the
resistance in aquitaphobius, in tepary
[SPEAKER_00]: bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the intention is then to combine this
also with tolerance to heat and tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's going to be possible
depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the common bacterial blight
resistance was, in essence, an easy task.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major gene trait in tepary bean,
although it's more complex in common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were able to do it using
acrobatics, which I will explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: With drought tolerance, we almost showed
that it's a generically more complex
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the point I would like to make here,
the emphasis is always transferring
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity from tepary bean to
common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the opposite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take this adaptation to heat and
drought in tepary bean and build tepary
[SPEAKER_00]: bean as another crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people start to think,
turning around to that, but the emphasis
[SPEAKER_00]: has always still been improving common
bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point in this talk is, yes,
we should be able to do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if the situation persists,
it really improves tepary bean as a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tepary bean here has domesticated wild
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be crossed with extreme difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have to use embryo culture and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lunatus actually cannot be crossed,
two vulgaris and the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I would say, gene P4.
[SPEAKER_00]: While tepary bean is gene P3, reciprocally
between common bean and tepary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an issue to take into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done whole genome sequencing of
land races, breeding materials in common
[SPEAKER_00]: bean, including these genetic stocks that
are resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here, the organization of
genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the 11 chromosomes from 1 to
11.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue, so the blue color represents an
Andean origin for the chromosome,
[SPEAKER_00]: the part of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these block of lines here from A
and D to Nabe 14, these are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: Andean domesticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, the red or pink lines
from Elbe to Vaxix are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesoamerican domesticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that there is some
integration, maybe asymmetric,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have more integration from
Mesoamerica to the Andean group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because of breeding,
wanting to introduce disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, we see a few other
interspecific introgressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one from tepary bean here is
typically at the end of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly why, but we have
noticed that disease resistance clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: are usually at the end of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be because there is higher
recombination there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recombination creates genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which could face the variability of the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also maybe easier to introgress a
material in a high recombination region
[SPEAKER_00]: than in a low recombination region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clearly is a caveat in terms of the
future, in terms of introgressing these
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says we need to have larger
populations, maybe to identify rare
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the contribution here of Santos,
who, although he got his degree at
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska, he came through summers to Davis
to help to also screen these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he did was to cross an interspecific
inbred line, the INB8P4, with a wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relative of tepary bean, the Parvifolius,
which has been relabeled recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same Parvifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have vulgaris, acotifolius,
and Parvifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they called it the VAP plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you the comparison,
if you cross vulgaris by acotifolius,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to make tons of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the labels to the left here of
the failed crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, on the other hand, you cross this line
to Parvifolius, you have a relatively high
[SPEAKER_00]: success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a visual comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get, then, seeds that will
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a normal vulgaris by tepary bean
cross, you have to do an embryo under your
[SPEAKER_00]: culture to retrieve anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is easier to cross this
vulgaris-containing hybrid inbred line
[SPEAKER_00]: with Parvifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, then, here, the developing
embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a plantlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, a whole plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this line is still sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you back-cross it to vulgaris,
you get a progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you compare the normal common bean
by tepary bean cross, the number of F1s
[SPEAKER_00]: that you obtain, in spite of the large
number of crosses, was maybe 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison to the cross of these
vaplines by tepary bean, you could obtain
[SPEAKER_00]: a large number, tenfold increase,
in the number of progenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of pods was also larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in spite of having a lower number of
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these vaplines, what they have allowed
us to do is to cross vulgaris with tepary
[SPEAKER_00]: bean at a much higher rate than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, initially, crossing vulgaris
and Parvifolius was low viability,
[SPEAKER_00]: low criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere in that genome, there must be
segments of Parvifolius that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: increased success rate in the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the genes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an empirical observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines have been sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here the reference genome,
which is an Andean reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an Acutifolius genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Mesoamerican genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have these vaplines,
these bridge lines, and interspecific
[SPEAKER_00]: vulgaris by Acutifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they looked at the number of
Parvifolius segments that were transferred
[SPEAKER_00]: to the progeny in these vaplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a much higher frequency here
compared to these interspecific vulgaris
[SPEAKER_00]: by Acutifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to remind you, these vaplines
are also interspecific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they involve a third species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a higher rate of
transmission in these vaplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be a problem in maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, is the sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light blue is common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common bean genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have introgressions,
the purple and the brown here,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Acutifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so large segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still, there is an issue of
recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these vaplines have an increased
introgression of Acutifolius or
[SPEAKER_00]: Parvifolius segments in the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So centers then wanted to test out if it
made any difference in terms of drought
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by crossing these vaplines with the
common bean as a source of drought
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance, you get a hybrid which you
back-cross to Acutifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then back-cross it to vulgaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another back-cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the pods here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no evidence, really, marked
evidence of sterility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually, he did then test the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have these interspecific lines
that result from the cross between
[SPEAKER_00]: vaplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Acutifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the vaplines themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have common bean lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these interspecific vulgaris by
peppery lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let me show you the results of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He then performed drought and heat stress
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that the progeny
lines, you can identify where you see
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny lines that have better yields,
more significantly higher yields under
[SPEAKER_00]: drought in two years, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his interpretation is that we are
successful in transferring some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerance into lines of common
bean that themselves are already more
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the field you see here,
the comparison between, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original vulgaris by Acutifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the process involving this
three-way cross with Parifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conclusion is, from other studies,
is that Acutifolius is for terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, terminal drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lima bean is actually for intermittent
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also working on lima bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here is we developed a
large-scale recombination from a tinbread
[SPEAKER_00]: population that was useful in developing a
reference genome in lima bean with
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian researchers and then mapping
several traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, you have determinacy in the
same chromosome location as in common
[SPEAKER_00]: bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 100 seed weight, which shows an
additive pattern flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also heavily determined by determinacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cyanogenesis, which shows
epistatic interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final thoughts here is that if we
want to increase the use of gene banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to be involved in pre-breeding,
like the experiments in crossability,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the testing of germplasm
conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using these domestication traits to
introduce them into an adapted germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of the opposite way that
we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I would acknowledge these
three people, because they are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take over the bean breeding program,
the East Africa program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have a group looking at the
physiology and the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Matthew Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can retire happily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I won't be retiring, let me tell
you, because I'll be working on that lima
[SPEAKER_00]: bean project with the SCRI to the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least I'm somewhat alleviated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very grateful to these individuals
for continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sorry, I'm running a little bit
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know Christine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the purpose of the slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if your map lines already
showed some kind of agronomically or
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculturally improvement in terms of
drought stress, or really just better
[SPEAKER_03]: possibility with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the fact that they have
viability, fertility, they survive in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, we think that it's a big progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the final detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pre-breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have to be next steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to realize what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I showed that slide with all
the labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try, you try, you try, and they fall
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having something that is viable and
fertile is already a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one gene that is every variety in
North America has to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the i-gene for resistant immunity,
I think for resistance to the common
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has reached the stage where people
cross elite by elite in common bean in
[SPEAKER_00]: North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they don't even have to screen for
it because the parents have it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: father needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that definitely is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other might be some of the
consumer traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed size, at least reach something that
is like a navy bean or a black bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the colors already, but the seed
size could be larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others, yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking now at heart-shattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think that it's a problem because
it comes from a dry area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are looking at the genetic basis of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that once we start growing,
the diseases and pests will find their way
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's wide open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting narrower and narrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are in competition with other
places in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So common bean has disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be, but then it's competing with
North Dakota, Michigan, and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's now lima bean, black-eyed pea or
cow pea, and garbanzos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And garbanzos get planted in the early
winter as a winter crop, whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: others are seen as a summer crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in California, they're also in
competition with trees, not trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand that because these
are going to need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect them to start complaining that
they don't get enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you plant a tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the economics is whatever
yields or brings in most money per unit
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying that at the beginning
lima bean is more of a water user versus
[SPEAKER_02]: the temporary beans or water saver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So could you highlight more on maybe the
water user part of lima beans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you've been able to
learn from the water saver beans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just really just the growing season
and that's why the different lengths?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in a sense, peppermint is not
that different from common bean,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for the fact that it accelerates
its growth under stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has this plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, if you used to work with water
fields, say, hey, I've beaten up on this
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary bean and it grows faster and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lima bean, what I think its
distinctive trait is, is that it has lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of biomass, including a very deep group
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so under heat stress, the leaf
temperature is lower than what you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: common bean or even temporary bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it is because of evaporation
that cools off the canopy and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that deep group system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen the same thing in wild
common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use wild common bean to improve
yield under stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The populations that do that come from
drought areas in Mexico, the driest areas
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have the deepest group
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a strong correlation,
but it's 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm satisfied with 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what is adaptation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a multitude of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is not one trait that determines
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 percent is insoluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these wild beans, they reshape
their root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you impose a stress equal amounts of
biomass, they get deeper and less branched
[SPEAKER_00]: root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know of a legume that has a really
high level of pre-amino acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the highest digestibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can maybe understand why they would have
digestibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to cleave those proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, they may also have
three non-protein amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of amino acids and not
necessarily the protein amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they really nutritional positive or
negative factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like there are some amino acids
that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to go to the depth of my...
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say anything for you to embarrass
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I meant to say is that the yield
pattern among the standard set of lines is
[SPEAKER_00]: determined, is grouped by location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not by the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a priori, you could say, well,
I'm going to have all the drought
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments on one side and all the well
watered on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's actually said it's grouped by
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nebraska seemed to be quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, oh, it's a fairly dry
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to resemble California maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's very separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be other factors involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really asking the question to try
to find an answer to draw the attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: people is that, how do we characterize an
environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
