[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I get started, I wanted to just
orient you to what I'm going to be talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I will be talking about the WU
Organic Farm, 15 years of research and
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because the organic farm has
only been there for about 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually was there when the organic
farm got its start.
[SPEAKER_02]: These pictures that you see on this first
slide will orient you to where I am in my
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I talk about biodegradable pots,
this will show up in the corner of the
[SPEAKER_02]: slide, so you know kind of where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
talk a little bit about the marker garden
[SPEAKER_02]: section of the organic farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to next talk a little bit about
biodegradable pots, and then a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about mulches, organic mulches,
and then finish up talking a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about education.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get started, I would like to
kind of introduce myself to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I am not necessarily a big name in
horticulture, despite that wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am a Belgian native, which is kind
of interesting by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just became a US citizen about three
months ago, so I'm really excited and
[SPEAKER_02]: proud about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a very classical horticulture
training in Europe, in Belgium,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I went to vocational technical high
school studying horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a very practical, hands-on
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I finished up my undergraduate
degree at Michigan State University,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was time for me to go to graduate
school, and I found myself in a molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: biology lab, which was Randy Woodson's
lab, and that's where I studied flower
[SPEAKER_02]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started at West Virginia
University, I continued doing some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: work on flower senescence, and there's
several papers that can be found with my
[SPEAKER_02]: name on it that is actually molecular
biology work, including this one in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Journal of Experimental Botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when I first came to WU,
there was the idea of starting up an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic farm, because we did not have a
lot of horticulture faculty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only natural for me to get involved
in this project, and so I started actually
[SPEAKER_02]: doing work on the organic farm,
specifically in vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had that strong kind of background
that allowed me to kind of go between
[SPEAKER_02]: these very, very different fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit more about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach anywhere from greenhouse
management to an introductory plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: people course, garden center management,
storage and handling of horticulture
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, herbaceous plant materials,
and I guide about three to 10 independent
[SPEAKER_02]: study students every semester.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can be doing a number of different
types of projects, so I do a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get started on organic,
the WU organic farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why study organic or sustainability?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, one major reason for
that is there's consumer demand,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have to apologize a little bit for
this slide because the white lettering
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't show up as nice on this picture as
I maybe wanted it to, but consumer demand
[SPEAKER_02]: is one of the main reasons to study
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can argue back and forth about what are
the benefits of organic and if it can feed
[SPEAKER_02]: the world or not, but what we cannot argue
with is that organic has seen an increase
[SPEAKER_02]: in production and consumption every year
for the last so many years since the final
[SPEAKER_02]: rule came out in 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a personal note, why do I study
organic farming and how do I see that
[SPEAKER_02]: relate to flower senescence even?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for me, studying organic is kind of
like being tied with your hands behind
[SPEAKER_02]: your back and trying to figure out how to
get something done, and that to me is what
[SPEAKER_02]: organic is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I see it as a real challenge to
actually produce something organically
[SPEAKER_02]: because we don't have the easy and
ready-made ways to deal with problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we have to work within a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why do we want to have an organic
farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the WU organic farm is unique,
maybe not completely unique, but the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: farm is organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is because we wanted a holistic
approach to organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farm actually incorporates animals,
chickens and sheep, agronomic crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: and vegetable crop production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a very holistic approach to
farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to mimic a very diversified
small farm in Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a very holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the goals of the organic farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not to compare conventional with
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to just assume that we want
to grow organic, that we want to give
[SPEAKER_02]: people that want to grow organic
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are not doing any comparison between
conventional and organic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we are interested in is best
management practices in organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are also interested in long-term
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the studies that I'm going to
talk about today is to kind of highlight
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of doing long-term work and what
kind of influence or what kind of impact
[SPEAKER_02]: that can have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly is to educate
undergraduate students and graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: students at this facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're seeing here is the actual
organic farm outlined in red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in white is the market garden section
of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to continue talking a little bit more
about organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to talk about today is
the market garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to talk about agronomic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to talk about the sheep or
the chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to focus in on vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I talk a little bit about the
long-term studies that we've got going on
[SPEAKER_02]: in the market garden, I'm going to talk
about plastic alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about biodegradable
containers and mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will see that there are some
connections between the market garden and
[SPEAKER_02]: these alternatives to plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try to highlight those for you to
kind of make sure that you see that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some contact continuity in my
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the market garden, like I said before,
the organic farm was started in 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of coincides with the final
rule that came out in 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farm was actually transitioning
while the USDA was actually putting out
[SPEAKER_02]: the final rule in 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were fully transitioned in 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important because I'm going to
show you a couple of data points from
[SPEAKER_02]: right after the transition phase and more
currently about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to try to make some
comparisons between those two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original objective was information
on transitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually wanted to look at what is one
of the best ways to transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to talk about that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The current objective is to look at the
impact of long-term manure applications on
[SPEAKER_02]: organic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will see there's some benefits and
some drawbacks to long-term manure
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the future objectives starting
next year is going to be the effect of
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage on soil quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have been building soils for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now we want to kind of know what
effect tillage will have on these soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing, of course,
is education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And education is key to what we do at the
WU Organic Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the market garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a completely randomized design with
32 plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 of those plots are low-input plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 16 of those plots are high-input
plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The low-input plots only get green
manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high-input plots get green manures and
a manure application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the big key to this particular
slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that we have a
four-year crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crop rotation goes between
legumes, solanaceae, cucurbity,
[SPEAKER_02]: and composites families of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a four-year rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means each crop has four low-input
plots, four high-input plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you keep on adding that up,
you come up with 32 plots, 16 and 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within those 16, there's four that are
solanaceae, four cucurbits, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the way this whole system is
set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we grow for the legumes,
we grow provider beans in a succession
[SPEAKER_02]: planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow coastal romaine lettuce in the
leafy crop or brassica, which is not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not a, so in the brassica,
we actually have, and I meant to say leafy
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, have coastal romaine lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the cucurbits, we have
dungeon zucchini.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the solanaceae, we have both
tomato and peppers in those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way that the actual experiment
is structured.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have high input.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have compost, which is basically aged
manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The manure that we use has gone through an
aging process, but is not organically
[SPEAKER_02]: certified compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we apply this material,
we treat it as if it is actual manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you some more information on
that to show you what kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: properties and characteristics are of this
manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we apply about 10 tons per acre of
this manure in the high input plots,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing in the low input plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: In winter, we establish a rye-vech cover
crop in both systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the summer, if we're done with a crop,
we either put in buckwheat or sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: also some other cover crops just to hold
over those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that's really important here
is that every year, every other year when
[SPEAKER_02]: we grow solanaceae and when we grow
cucurbits, we apply a hay mulch to those
[SPEAKER_02]: plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that hay mulch actually gets
incorporated into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the low input plots, they get cover
crops, but they also get, every other
[SPEAKER_02]: year, they get a mulch that is tilled in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that becomes part of the nutrients that
actually make it into those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one, the high input,
gets an extra 10 tons per acre of manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, 10 tons per acre is a very,
very small amount to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically just a little dusting or
coating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I mention that is because you
will see some of the big impacts over a
[SPEAKER_02]: period of 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the actual compost or aged
manure analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to draw your attention to
is that it's got a fairly high pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because it actually comes from
a dairy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is some calcium that actually
made it into this compost or this aged
[SPEAKER_02]: manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want you to note the fairly
high levels of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are also key to what I'm
going to show you next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm showing you here is 2004,
immediately after transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also showing you 2014,
which is the last year that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I analyzed data for.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want you to note is right here,
the phosphorus levels in the low input
[SPEAKER_02]: plot have remained about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the key to that is we basically we've
been removing vegetable matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we've been reapplying the hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of that is completely basically
balanced things out when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we are looking at 2014, one thing
that I want you to note is the huge
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in phosphorus levels between
2004 and 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get huge increases in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is only logical because we've
been applying manure for the last 15
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you may say, why are you keep on
applying manure over and over and over
[SPEAKER_02]: again, even though you have plenty of
phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we were doing this experiment in
conjunction with another long term
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment that actually had a seven year
rotation in agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to get through at least two
of those rotations before we switched up
[SPEAKER_02]: this experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we get to these very,
very high levels of phosphorus that really
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't need or you probably don't even
want in these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was just basically part of the
experimental design.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I want you to note is
the very high levels of calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because that aged manure came
in with quite a bit of calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also occasionally limed the plots,
especially the low input plots,
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that the pH was about the
same as the high input plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a little bit more information
on the actual yields that we received off
[SPEAKER_02]: of those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this is showing is we have the low
input.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have pounds per acre and high input
pounds per acre for 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the same thing for 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we noticed is that when you
combine multiple years together,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't really see very many differences
between low and high input plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we normalized the data
to percent of an average yield for that
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that allowed us then to combine the
two years, the 2004 and the 2014,
[SPEAKER_02]: together and do statistical analysis on
those combined years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is plenty of other data that
I'm just showing you for these two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the result of all of this is
basically that for the high input plots,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get about 20% to 25% higher yields
when you apply 10 tons per acre of this
[SPEAKER_02]: aged manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what we came up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that kind of consistently,
except maybe for tomatoes, where we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: see those same differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that does is if you take that
amount of yield and you turn it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: monetary value, and basically what we did
is we can get, let's say, $2 for green
[SPEAKER_02]: beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have a yield that is about 5,000
some pounds more per acre, you multiply
[SPEAKER_02]: that by the amount that you can get for
the beans, let's say $2 per pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: you come up with a number that indicates
what that compost is actually worth to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually see that this compost,
this 10 tons of dairy manure, is worth or
[SPEAKER_02]: is of a lot of value, especially to a
market garden type of setting where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do retail selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this basically shows you that
getting compost off-farm, you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: get that at very high cost and still come
out ahead when you're applying this
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the main thing that I want you to
remember of all of this is that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: still get good yields in the low-input
plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just use cover crops and hay
mulches, we get good yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: We add in manure, we get about 20% higher
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means is that 20% higher yield,
you can actually make a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can actually afford to apply more
manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are some drawbacks to
applying manure over and over and over
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of those drawbacks is those
high-phosphor stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are also some key benefits to
applying that manure over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that you will see
here is that in the high-input plots,
[SPEAKER_02]: after about five years of applying four
years of applying this dairy manure,
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually increased the level of soil
organic matter to 6.4%, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also saw that if you keep on doing
this, after about 15 years of application
[SPEAKER_02]: of this aged manure, we saw that you can
actually increase the organic matter
[SPEAKER_02]: content of the soil to about 8.7%,
which is really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, we can see differences just
by looking at the soil when it rains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually see differences in the
darkness of these soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's by applying basically 150 tons
over 15 years of manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that sounds like a lot, but if you
only do that every single year,
[SPEAKER_02]: very small amounts, that is a very,
very small amount to apply every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other benefit we saw, besides
increased in soil organic matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: is we also saw that the bulk density of
the soil decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what you see right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bulk density is basically inversely
related to the soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you have more organic matter,
the soil is weighs less per volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what you see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want to draw your attention to
is that those differences, if you see
[SPEAKER_02]: those error bars, those differences did
not show up until about 10 years after we
[SPEAKER_02]: started the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because we just have a lot of
variability in those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my suggestion here is that this is
related, or this is important when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about long-term studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that you would have
never seen if you would have stopped this
[SPEAKER_02]: study after about five or six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are some of the reasons that
I think that we should actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term studies, because some of these
differences don't show up until much
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to recap this section of my talk,
green manures together with haymilch
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporation can maintain yields about
80% of those when you actually apply the
[SPEAKER_02]: manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite improvements in yield,
soil organic matter, and bulk density,
[SPEAKER_02]: continuous application of relatively low
levels of manure can lead to excessive
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of potassium and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what we want to do next with
these plots is we want to reverse the
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to take the high-input plots
and start treating them as low-input
[SPEAKER_02]: plots, trying to draw down the phosphorus
and potassium levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to take low-input plots and
start applying composted or aged manure,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then stop at a normal level of
potassium, phosphorus, and try to manage
[SPEAKER_02]: those particular plots only with green
manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an occasional addition of regular
manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next I'm going to talk a little bit
about alternatives to plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to remember that I talked
about hay and hay mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will come up here in a little bit
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to make sure that
you're on board with me on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about alternative
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was part of a specialty crops
research initiative project where we
[SPEAKER_02]: studied 10 different biodegradable
containers that were either on the market
[SPEAKER_02]: or were poised to be on the market in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we actually tested these 10
different containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular control plastic, a bioplastic
wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a commonure, our compost pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a wood pulp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's called a biosleeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made out of also a biodegradable
plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a rice hull, both slotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And solid rice hull.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is made with rice hulls and basically
a wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pressed together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a straw pot that's made with rice
straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have a peat pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are the different pots that
were used in this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing that I want to show you is
that there were actual differences in
[SPEAKER_02]: growth when we grew plants in these
biopots or these alternative containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big difference that we saw is right
here, that the control actually had
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly lower levels of growth than some
of these biopots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll get in a minute here why that
could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really what I want you to note is that
the straw pot and the sleeve had some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the highest biomass production in these
different pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that people sometimes
say, well, that could be because these
[SPEAKER_02]: pots had different volumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have different volumes of media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why you might get different
levels of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when we first started this
experiment, we actually measured the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of media we put in each pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of the plants were growing in the
same volume of media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if the pot was a little bit
taller, you had the same amount of actual
[SPEAKER_02]: media in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we think is going on here is this
straw pot and this sleeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sleeve does not have a bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I think is going on here is
additional aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these drain better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing with the straw pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very, very open to the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the media dries out much more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this warrants some more
investigation because even for plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: pots, if that's the case, maybe there
should be more holes in a plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying if that's true or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's the case, you could actually
minimize the amount of plastic you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually put in a pot and still get good
or better production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's something that I think came
out of this research is that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility that maybe aeration is really
key to increased biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the crop we grew right here is
New Guinean patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a floriculture crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was all done in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing that I want to show you is
we checked for pH differences within these
[SPEAKER_02]: different pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used the pour-through method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the result of that was that the dairy
manure, which you would expect to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher pH, actually had a higher pH
throughout the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are averages over the whole
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are pH averages over the whole
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we noticed that the dairy manure
actually had higher pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you could expect that because if you
use the pour-through method, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going to leach some of that
compost, the dairy manure that makes up
[SPEAKER_02]: that pot into your leachate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's probably why we have a slightly
higher pH in those pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also probably why we have a
slightly lower pH in peat pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you rinse it, you leach it through
the pot, it's going to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this really makes a difference or an
impact on the actual growth, we doubt
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably more an artifact of actually
how we measured ECM pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing that I want you to know is
that these pots have different ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: hold up during production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we did is we took containers
after we were done with production,
[SPEAKER_02]: we emptied them, and we actually measured
how much force it will take to penetrate
[SPEAKER_02]: the side of the pot to see how well they
disintegrate or how well they hold up
[SPEAKER_02]: during production.
[SPEAKER_02]: The result of this, not surprising,
is that plastic pots hold up better than
[SPEAKER_02]: most other alternative pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we also see is that the dairy
manure, the cow pot, and this jiffy pot or
[SPEAKER_02]: the peat pot, they disintegrate the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: After about six weeks of production,
when you try to lift up these pots,
[SPEAKER_02]: they basically fall apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these studies were done in shuttle
trays, and so these pots were held
[SPEAKER_02]: together pretty well during production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after production, if you tried to lift
them up, they do tear apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing, again, we're looking at the
cow pot and the jiffy pot, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way, are brand names.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a composted dairy manure and,
again, a peat pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we noticed is that we got more algal
growth on those pots than any of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: pots in the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the only other one is the wood fiber
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to draw your attention to some
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I want you to notice the
idea that this straw pot has more aeration
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's cross-linked straw,
and it's got lots of openings.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rice hull has slots, so it has more
aeration, better drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this biodegradable pot has better
drainage because it does not have a
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want you to focus in on the idea
that these two pots now have come up twice
[SPEAKER_02]: with some caution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will get into how I actually want
to try to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing that we did is we
looked at how easily can these pots
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be denested, how easily can they
be used in a production line where you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually are trying to take the pots
apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we noticed is that some of these
pots, the rice hull pots right down here,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are a lot easier to remove out of a
stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, for example, this Jiffy pot,
and even the control plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what I want to focus in on is
that these two pots actually are very
[SPEAKER_02]: easily handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I want you to think about
is that this surface is very rough,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that makes these pots stick together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes it much more difficult to
actually handle these pots in production
[SPEAKER_02]: settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's switch gears.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to switch gears now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had the information about the
biopots in greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do these pots behave when they're
planted in the actual field?
[SPEAKER_02]: So two pots that we didn't plant directly
in the field are this bioplastic one and
[SPEAKER_02]: this rice hull pot because they are
actually supposed to be removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are compostable, but they are not
supposed to be plantable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this study, we only use plants that
can actually be planted in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why there's a cross over
these two that are basically not part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing that I want you to see here
is really there's nothing to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the result of all of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, all of these plants,
if you plant them, together with their
[SPEAKER_02]: pot, into the field, and you compare it to
a plastic pot that has been removed and
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant planted in the field,
you get the same biomass production over a
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, once they go in the ground,
they grow just as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter which kind of pot you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pot decomposition at the end of
the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the season, I had my
graduate student dig up all these pots,
[SPEAKER_02]: take all the little pieces of biopot she
could still find, and feed it through a
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf area meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she looked at how much of that pot
was still there in the actual field,
[SPEAKER_02]: or opposite how much was still left over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice that the manure pot,
and even less so the pea pot, but the rice
[SPEAKER_02]: hull pot, they have very little
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rice hull has very little
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: The manure pot has a lot of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's related to the
greenhouse study, where I actually talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about the idea that these pots,
they fall apart after about six to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks of production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to recap all of this, and I know I'm
going to run out of time, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to run through this a little bit more
quickly, to kind of really emphasize the
[SPEAKER_02]: main points of all of this is that all of
these pots have pros and cons associated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one should you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it all depends on what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all depends on what you're
ultimately looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for a pot that holds up
well during mechanized production,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would gravitate towards a plastic or
even a rice hull pot, because they can
[SPEAKER_02]: easily be denested.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are looking for a retail setting,
you may want to stay away from the pea or
[SPEAKER_02]: the dairy manure pot, because it has a lot
of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of algae growing on it,
and it's unsightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all depends on ultimately what you
want to do with these pots, where you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go with these pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I think is important,
just the same we have controlled release
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers that are used in horticulture,
I think we should have something that is
[SPEAKER_02]: akin to controlled release pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, we should basically market
these pots based on how long they hold up
[SPEAKER_02]: in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can envision a pot that would be
a six-week pot versus a three-month pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would be different materials and
structured differently, so that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're growing and you know how long
that pot is supposed to hold up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plastic still rules for the main
reason that it's just easy to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of attributes that really
work well for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I want to talk about is
mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this picture is showing is a wool
mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I told you before that we have a
holistic approach to our organic farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to use on-farm resources
as mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this study, where we looked at
different mulches, we thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: what does the farm have to offer that we
can use as mulches?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are raising sheep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to shear these sheep every
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wool does not make much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not a lot of money in wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually thought we could use it as
a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing with hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farm generates hay for the sheep in
the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We started using hay mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last one is leaf litter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have woodlots that are part of our
organic farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we collected leaf litter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We set up an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's a randomized design.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had seven different treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two were plastic, basically plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had that in two areas, a 10 by 20 and a
20 by 20 area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main reason for that is we wanted to
know if in the middle of those plots,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we still got enough moisture to
actually grow a pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we had these two
different sizes of plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also used hay, waste wool, leaf litter,
and then hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no weeding at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, the result of all of this is
marketable yields in plastic are high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can get comparable yields with hay
mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what this is showing is
basically that hay mulch gives you
[SPEAKER_02]: comparable yields to plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about this is that
this, by the way, I want you to note that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's 67 to 76.
[SPEAKER_02]: Degrees on this axis just to show the
differences a little bit more clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clearly, plastic is going to have
higher temperatures, whereas hay had much
[SPEAKER_02]: lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is just an inherent result of
those materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing that I want to
show you is that the moisture content
[SPEAKER_02]: under plastic was much lower than under
hay and even wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this wool is something that we've seen
over and over again is that we see much
[SPEAKER_02]: higher soil moisture under wool than we
see in any other mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not just in this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some other work that we showed
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are some problems with wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, basically, what I want to say
is that on-farm resources can substitute
[SPEAKER_02]: for plastic mulch, specifically hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hay has the additional benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, back to when I first started the
talk, you can use it as a mulch,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can also use it for fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a double kind of thing that
you can get out of hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it as something that is
actually incorporated in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also use it as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wool has a potential as a perennial
mulch because one of the things it does
[SPEAKER_02]: not do is degrade very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the season, you have almost
as much wool left as you do in the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really, really thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it has potential for
actually a perennial mulch because it just
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't degrade very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes many, many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have to clear it off the
plots before we till it because it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: bound up in the tiller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, plastics come out ahead mostly
because of the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about hay, applying about
five tons of hay per acre of vegetable
[SPEAKER_02]: production, we're talking about a lot of
hay, hay that can be sold or used as
[SPEAKER_02]: animal feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about a very high cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there's some drawbacks associated
with some of these alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other work that I've done at the
organic farm includes some work with green
[SPEAKER_02]: beans and control of Mexican bean beetle
with a biological called Pediobius
[SPEAKER_02]: fivulatus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done some work on solarization in
West Virginia, which actually works,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some work with water inclusion
in season extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also done some work on transplant
production, specifically transplant
[SPEAKER_02]: production for organic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, I'm sorry if I'm going over a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that if people
have to leave that I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing is the organic farm and
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, we've had about 40
interns that have interned at the farm and
[SPEAKER_02]: learned about organic production
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just recently got a retired faculty
member donate $25,000 a year for an
[SPEAKER_02]: internship program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we now have about six or seven
interns every year that can help us out
[SPEAKER_02]: with the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the research that I've shown you
was done on kind of a shoestring budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it was done with
undergraduate researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the, I guess,
there's a benefit to that, to the student.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, it's sometimes difficult to
find the consistency in data collection
[SPEAKER_02]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have two majors that link up with
the organic farm very closely,
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture and agroecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do have these two majors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have the organic farm internship
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we run a winter CSA and a summer CSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty small CSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still generates about $8,000 for
the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter CSA and the summer CSA are
20-week CSAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask for about $20, $25 a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we generate about $8,000 to $10,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also started looking into wholesale
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because so far, really, the farm has
focused very much on local production,
[SPEAKER_02]: local markets, CSA, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to venture out into something
that is a little bit more wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've contracted with a company in
Virginia, Appalachian Harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: to take any butternut squash that we
produce on the farm that meets their
[SPEAKER_02]: standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as part of that effort, we actually
had to get GAP certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to actually go through the
process of GAP certification now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the really neat thing about that is
students actually can be involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic certification process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now also in the GAP certification
process, which is really important if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to do any production that
you're trying to sell wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most suppliers, most aggregators,
will actually require that you're GAP
[SPEAKER_02]: certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Future directions for the work at WU.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, what I want to look at is no-till
or low-till vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to compare that to conventional
tillage and see how these soils that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: built up over the years with this high
soil organic matter, this low bulk
[SPEAKER_02]: density, how are those soils going to
behave under different tillage systems?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we're going to go with
that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to continue that long-term
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I want to look at is
mulches a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, these on-farm resources and
how we can best use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we definitely want to expand the CSA
and entrepreneurship options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the university is really keen on the
idea to get students exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the key pillars of WVU is
prosperity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the university is really pushing
the idea of creating entrepreneurs on
[SPEAKER_02]: campus that can go back to their
communities and actually start businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we will definitely emphasize this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing that I think we
don't do enough is actually measure the
[SPEAKER_02]: impact of educational methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the impact of these CSAs,
of these student clubs, on the learning
[SPEAKER_02]: and teaching at a university?
[SPEAKER_02]: So keys to undergraduate education at WVU.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes anywhere from undergraduate
research, which, by the way, stretches
[SPEAKER_02]: limited funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can oftentimes find students that get
interested and excited about a project,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can get them for credit to help me
out with my research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one way that I stretch my very,
very limited funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, the students gets exposure to
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes, they go on to graduate
school, either at WVU or somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Independent studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of the projects students do are
research projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to encourage projects beyond just
research projects, more demonstration,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just to teach them certain techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that we do in
independent studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow seven or eight hundred poinsettias
every fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow a bunch of hanging baskets in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And students actually get exposure to some
of those things that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clubs can be a key to education.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to instill a sense of
entrepreneurship, because clubs are
[SPEAKER_02]: oftentimes in fundraising mode if they
want to travel somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a great way to kind of combine
these two together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last one is internships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Internships both on the farm, the WVU
Organic Farm, but also outside of the farm
[SPEAKER_02]: are key to a really good undergraduate
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple more minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to do is I want to introduce a
few of my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there is any interest beyond what
I've talked about in the audience,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to focus you in on what some
of the other people are doing at WVU.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kang Mo Koo, right up here,
he's a new faculty member.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an assistant professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been with us for about a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working on glucosinolates,
mostly broccoli, but also some other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, looking at nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Guttensohn, right here,
he's also new.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been hired within the last year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is very interested in plant
biochemistry, specifically terpenoid
[SPEAKER_02]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Nicole Waterland, who's interested
in greenhouse production, does work with
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also has switched over some of her
ornamental work into vegetable production
[SPEAKER_02]: in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: David Davis comes to us by way of Virginia
Tech, and he does mostly teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis Jett, down here, he is high tunnels,
and he does a lot of work with high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels in West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim Cotson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here, he actually takes care of the
sheep and the economic crops on the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, of course, many, many others
that have other additional roles at the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to finish up, the take-home messages,
the things that I really would like you to
[SPEAKER_02]: go home with today, are manure
applications have clear benefits,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that you could have
probably guessed even without doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I would like to note is that
building soils can also lead to excessive
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea is that you really have to
combine these manure and compost
[SPEAKER_02]: applications together with cover crops to
really come up with a good mix for
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plastics are popular for a reason,
and the alternatives have very high
[SPEAKER_02]: standards to match.
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing else, cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just very, very cheap to lay down a
layer of plastic, and it is just much more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive to use other alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing that I'd like you to
remember is that some of these changes
[SPEAKER_02]: that we see, not just in soil organic
matter, but also in bulk density,
[SPEAKER_02]: are very, very slow to materialize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so long-term studies are very,
very important to what we do in
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said before, more is not better
when building soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes, we still have growers that
will not necessarily test their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is, again, basically saying
soil tests are key to good fertility
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then plastics, in many cases,
still rule for good reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing that I want to
mention is these other class experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other class experiences are, to me,
key to a good education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of education happens
outside of the classroom, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: inside of the classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so internships, clubs, any kind of
independent study, even though that could
[SPEAKER_02]: be considered a class, is additional
exposure to creativity that I think is
[SPEAKER_02]: very important to foster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'm going to stop right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll entertain questions if you have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a threshold for the T and K in
the soil that creates an adverse effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not reaching the high enough salt
levels to affect yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we are doing is basically those
very high, potassium is not as big of an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue, but phosphorus can actually become
a pollutant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it could be a point source of
pollution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those levels that I showed you
after 15 years are three times as high as
[SPEAKER_02]: what would normally be good for
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're way, way higher than the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think part of developing a holistic
organic farm is also selecting plant
[SPEAKER_00]: idiotypes that are suited to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious if the organic farm does
any variety evaluations or any direct
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's any breeding efforts at the
farm, no, we do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one graduate student who's doing a
little bit of breeding work with quinoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's about the extent of any kind of
breeding that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely have to say that that is
really important, the idea that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to use varieties that are basically
developed with organic systems in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just started using certain of these
varieties and just for consistency sake
[SPEAKER_02]: have stuck through a lot of these
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for example, we do use a local
variety, West Virginia 63, that was
[SPEAKER_02]: developed at the university that has some
late blight and early blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do try that we just have not made
any kind of major inroads into any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question was, do we use any
irrigation on these plots?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the long term study, we do not
consistently use irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my best way of describing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years, we do a better job than other
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all depends on again, because we
have undergraduate students that help us
[SPEAKER_02]: out and some years, we can just do a
better job of that than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potassium for sure, the phosphorus is
probably bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that probably cannot necessarily be
leached as easily as the potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there could be an argument be made for
that very high level of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tie that together with organic
matter, that it is not as much of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pollutant as if it was just in a more
mineral soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm not going to necessarily make
that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just wondering if you could talk
a little bit more about the organic farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: the structure, the management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a teaching farm, a research farm,
or a student farm?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, does the organic farm help
you recruit more students?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you attracting new students that
wouldn't normally be interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farm is teaching and education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a manager?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a farm worker that does the
mowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the other stuff is run by me
and Dr. Coates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we manage the interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We manage everything that happens at that
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to generate some funds to go back
into that internship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do run that CSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do sell a little bit to farmers
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been really reluctant to sell to
farmers markets because we oftentimes get
[SPEAKER_02]: complaints that we compete with local
producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that I haven't heard
here, as I've been talking to people,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit of an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the other part of the
question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you attracting students because of the
organic farm?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you use it as a recruitment tool?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do use it as a recruitment tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And agroecology, that's the major that
this is closely tied to, even though a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the students that intern are also
horticulture students.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we bring students on campus,
this is something that is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: highlighted as something that we have on
hand for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, it's definitely used in recruiting
efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly tied to agroecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greenhouse is more used to recruit
horticulture students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we quickly go to Geneva,
there is a lunch for graduate students
[SPEAKER_01]: starting very soon on the third floor in
the conference room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything quickly from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking at producing more of the
nitrogen in the plots themselves or
[SPEAKER_02]: elsewhere on the farm to try to balance
out that question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the big thing is going to be we
need to get a better handle on how much
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen is in that hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be our first, that would be
the way we would grow the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: green manures, measure how much nitrogen
we're fixing there, and then fill in with
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly the hay as an additional level of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then only as a last resort,
if we need basically phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to the manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be kind of the level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would try to meet what are
basically kind of standard levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen that you would want to apply to
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the problem that we sometimes have is
how much of that nitrogen is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: available to that crop versus how much is
held over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a whole other reason for the
research question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we would try to manage most of
it by cover crops, by legumes.
Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Stan, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could all give him a round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
