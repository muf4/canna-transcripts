[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone, for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the introduction alluded to,
I'm going to talk about my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: while on the Drear Award.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what my main focus is in giving this
talk is less to kind of walk you through
[SPEAKER_00]: my experience in a chronological order,
but more to share with you some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences, some of the findings,
and some of the things that I found to be
[SPEAKER_00]: most interesting while experiencing the
biodiversity in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here in the horticulture
department, and I spent a number of years
[SPEAKER_00]: working in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a horticulturist, whenever you come
up and you meet a plant, you have to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: it three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did you get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great picture of a ficus
macrophylla here in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me for scale standing down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the kind of questions that I
tend to like to ask plants because they
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to reveal very interesting stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I asked this question of some of
the plants that I've experienced and seen
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout visiting gardens or other
places around the world, one place kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: kept coming up time and time again,
where you just would find very unusual and
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting flora and just something that
was just kind of outside the realm of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we tend to typically find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a lot of people know here in the
horticulture department, South African
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have had a large impact on the
horticultural trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may or may not realize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through some examples
right here of a bunch of plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not realize come from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Xanthondysia, the calla lily,
is a very common plant that is endemic to
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been used and hybridized
extensively for all sorts of ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pelargoniums, the flowering geraniums,
a plant that is completely ubiquitous and
[SPEAKER_00]: used for planting and potting beds or as a
popular bedding plant is a genus of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that also comes from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nephophia, the red-hot poker, a very
common ornamental plant that we tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: find in Mediterranean climates and
subtropical regions and is used
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively also comes from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterlitzia, the bird of paradise,
a very interesting genus of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five species that comprise the
genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including some that grow as large as
trees, but as we can see from these
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures here, also picked up and used
very commonly as a garden plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Proteaceae is a large family of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the very special components of
plants that we kind of see in South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, a lot of people when they think
about the Western Cape, when they think
[SPEAKER_00]: about finebos, this is one of the images
that comes to mind, this idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: this protea, this group of plants that is
unique to that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get into some of these details as
we go through the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteas are used as for fresh flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the flesh flower industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also, when you dry the florets
themselves, can actually store quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this picture is
illustrating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right are protea heads that have
been cut and are dried and are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped all over the world to use for cut
flower displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Succulent plant biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa boasts having roughly 30% of
the world succulent plant biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find this particularly in the
Northwestern part of the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we find all sorts of interesting
things like high diversity of aloes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or many of the plants in the Azoaceae
family, such as Haworthias, or plants like
[SPEAKER_00]: Conophytums, which are also commonly used
horticulturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are very interested in these plants
for some of the interesting adaptations
[SPEAKER_00]: they develop, but also because they're fun
and they're interesting and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to put them in terrariums and
other such uses such as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two different genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bulb biodiversity is another
major, you know, we're getting through a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of plants here, and I hope to exposing
people to the kind of diversity that is
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here are just some great pictures of
the bulb biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even here in the horticulture
department, we focus on, some of our labs
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on growing plants such as the
Ornithoglum, or as well as the Eukomis is
[SPEAKER_00]: another cut flower and also bedding plant
that has also gained worldwide appeal and
[SPEAKER_00]: use in the horticultural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost through, one of the very
interesting things about South Africa is
[SPEAKER_00]: known as some of the mass flowerings up in
Namaqualand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namaqualand roughly refers to a region
that is the Northwestern part of South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, and they're known for having these
magnificent displays if they get good
[SPEAKER_00]: rains in the wintertime when they get
their precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a phenomenon that's been noted
for, I want to say, since the late or
[SPEAKER_00]: early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to kind of point out what's going
on here in particular, this picture on the
[SPEAKER_00]: far right, this is a picture taken at one
of the National Botanic Gardens that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually managed more of a natural area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking at here is you can
kind of see is just the vast diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: different bulbs that are blooming and
growing in this one set of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a landscape that has been managed
primarily only by weed removal and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: having grazing that came in and causes a
natural disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings people to this kind of part of
the country where most people wouldn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: for tourism otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you contrast this to the shots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a farm that's also in the
Namaqualand region, but they annually plow
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage these pioneering species like
the Ursinias here that cause this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mass carpet blooming effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see from the picture,
it just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these images of the mass blooms
have really captured people's
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of one of the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually taken by Hans Hera,
the first curator at Stellenbosch Botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden where I was spending my drear
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was one of the first color
photographs to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a postcard, actually, to make it to
Europe and kind of put this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: biological display kind of on the world
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also find some of the weird and
the wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants such as the Hidnora africana
here, which is a parasitic plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows on euphorbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a Piper ales, so related to
Aristolachia or the Dutchman's pipe that
[SPEAKER_00]: some people may know, as well as wonderful
plants like Welwichia mirabilis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in the Nutellis order,
a very fascinating plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only species in its whole family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this grows in the Northwest region up
into Angola and Namibia in kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: fog belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a very unusual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been amazed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, Stellenbosch
Botanic Garden was the first garden to
[SPEAKER_00]: ever grow this plant from seed and get it
up to a point where it would cone and set
[SPEAKER_00]: seed once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through that kind of display of
pictures that I just showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to have revealed just some of the
things that really make the biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: of South Africa so fascinating,
so interesting, and something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty unusual compared to what we may see
when we walk out of our door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the natural question that comes
to mind is, why is South Africa so
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically diverse when it comes to its
vascular plant flora?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm showing you an image here of
what's known as a flower show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flower show in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in large contrast to what we
may experience if we went to a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: show, maybe like the Philadelphia flower
show or a flower show in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these kind of flower shows that
we may be used to are kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: contrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go and we'll see a plant,
but the plant may not be the main focus of
[SPEAKER_00]: the display.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be more kind of ornamental or
innate, or the scene they create around it
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be something that they kind of
focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In South Africa, there's a number of town
that host these flower shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these flower shows, what farmers and
local people in that community will go out
[SPEAKER_00]: just into their fields, just around the
roadside, just anywhere that's around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll harvest these massive amounts
of just plants that are growing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: These weren't grown ornamentally just for
these displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the natural kind of abundance
that's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, putting it together is kind
of contrived in this kind of context of
[SPEAKER_00]: having so much of the biodiversity or the
plants themselves stuck together in one
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to share this image just
because it shows both a different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective of how South Africans interact
with their flora, but also just the sheer
[SPEAKER_00]: magnitude of the diversity that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are great experiences for
getting people interested in horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: in gardening, but they also have a large
educational component where they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have sections where they label all these
plants and you can go and you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually learn what's around you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of put South Africa in context
and put the flora there in context,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place that we're all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: North America, excluding Mexico,
north of Mexico, makes up roughly 15% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Earth's surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that 15% of the Earth's surface,
we have about 6.25% of the world's total
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular plant biodiversity, 20,000
species, roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we jump to South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking at here is less
than 1% of the Earth's surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 0.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30,000 individual species,
so roughly 10% of the world's total
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a huge amount of biodiversity in a
relatively small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this distribution is not even across
the whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain areas that have more
speciation than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to continue to give people a context,
we're going to work from a large scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: focus in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's multiple ways how people
choose to describe the different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that are around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the biggest scale, the scale we
typically look at is known as floristic
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And floristic kingdoms describe
relationships that are primarily between
[SPEAKER_00]: family and on the general level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they focus on three main different
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They focus on distribution of these
families in general, either being
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmopolitan, very widespread,
being endemic, very narrow, only occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very small amount of space,
or having disjunctions, large barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: between different types of families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redwoods are a good example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in China, you may have the dawn
redwood, Metis aqua ecliptis scroboides.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in North America, you have the
coastal redwood or the giant redwood would
[SPEAKER_00]: be an example of distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to point out in this
picture, we can see that the Halarctic
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom is the largest, the one that we're
probably most familiar with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look down to the tip of Africa,
we see that there's one little section
[SPEAKER_00]: here that stands out in pink here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is known as the Cape Verde.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I show this picture and
kind of point this out is that even on
[SPEAKER_00]: this scale, even on the largest scale of
the Earth, what we're seeing is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something going on down there that
makes the flora there so unique in its
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships and families in general that
it highlights this one region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only country in the world that
houses its own floristic kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a big way of looking at
plants, so there's some subjectiveness to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good general context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now taking it one step down,
we step into the levels of biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what biomes primarily describe are
plants based on their structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they overall look?
[SPEAKER_00]: And on ecological factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main factor is that people use to
describe flora based on biomes are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be minimal winter temperature,
seasonality of rainfall, and then summer
[SPEAKER_00]: aridity, how dry it gets in a region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are kind of, we're going to go
into some of these in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the kind of big landscapes that we
may think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the northeastern part of the United
States, for example, we think of our
[SPEAKER_00]: hardwood forest as being our predominant
biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we went to the Midwest, we would think
of what historically would be the Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Plains as being another biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big kind of character, you know,
the way the floras grow, the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually look is the major kind of driver
of this or the way we describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go through a couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start off with the
savanna biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is found in the north eastern part of
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are areas that tend to be
dominated by a lot of grass and few trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the area where you'll find the
beginning of the baobab trees that will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue some of the world's most widest
trees that you find that will continue up
[SPEAKER_00]: into subtropical and tropical Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the landscapes that support
the large mammals that are major drivers
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ecology in this landscape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next kind of biome, we stepped into a
very big one now, is the forest biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forest biome is a very interesting
biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the smallest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's less than a percent of the
total biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that map I showed you before,
you didn't probably even notice it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this biome is very interesting because
it is a biome that receives, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomes in South Africa are either dictated
by summer rainfall or winter rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a major definer of the kind of
plants that tend to grow in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the forest biomes, they receive
rainfall all year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because they are on just along
the south coast of South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about this biome is
it's very, very concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, with the lights,
it's hard to make this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about this picture here
is saying it's a very kind of compressed
[SPEAKER_00]: where these forests actually grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is along the south coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of going north here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much where this picture cuts
off right here, you end up in finebos
[SPEAKER_00]: biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes from kind of shrubby
grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come in down here,
and you're in this forested area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually see this contrast
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little bit here is actually finebos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then forest immediately stops off
these cliffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a relatively small biome,
but a very interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where we tend to find, obviously,
the big trees, things like the Podocarpus
[SPEAKER_00]: vulcatis, or the yellowwood, which are
some of their giant trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podocarpus are some interesting lineages
in themselves having relations to flora in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, or New Zealand, and some large
disjunctions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this other picture up of
Trichoclatus cronatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to the witch hazel family,
which we may know from our local flora
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and kind of one of the few that is
present both in our flora as well as South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major biome is the Karoo biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the kind of areas that support
a lot of this really interesting succulent
[SPEAKER_00]: plant biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to get winter rainfall and have
a lot of these interesting succulent
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, cam adaptation,
and do interesting things like grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in this picture here,
they're little kind of phytums that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just eking out an existence just between
these rocks where they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to direct sun and have their root
system dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to find a lot of biodiversity
here in aloes or this near endemic family,
[SPEAKER_00]: Azoaceae, with things like the Drosanthums
and the Conophytums as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least on our tour of
biomes is the Finebos biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Finebos biome is what most
people think about when they talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of the concept that comes to
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this biome kind of looks like is
you have lots of restios, lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: grass-like plants that we can kind of see
on the slide on the right, and then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left, this is kind of a more typical we
see proteas in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a shrubby landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never gets much above three meters in
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we tend to find the
highest amount of our biodiversity and our
[SPEAKER_00]: highest amount of endonism in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few more images of what you may
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It supports a large bulb flora as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a few more pictures here for
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this middle picture here
just the size of this flower head,
[SPEAKER_00]: of this proteus and aroides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of walked people now starting
from a global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stepped down to a more localized scale
by thinking about biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the finest scale, well,
pretty much the finest scale that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into here is vegetation maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a vegetation map is a way of defining
your flora based on more of the species
[SPEAKER_00]: level and more of the general level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I kind of want to point out just
here in this picture is that as we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the northeastern part of the country,
we're still seeing pretty large swatches
[SPEAKER_00]: of solid colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we get down to the western part,
it looks like someone took paint and just
[SPEAKER_00]: smacked it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot of different
interactions between all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: specific vegetation types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each of these patches is big enough
to be able to define them broadly by
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships or likenesses between
species in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within that, we see that we have
tons of different vegetation types going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a quick thing to point out here,
this is pretty much we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: finebos regions in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more of the succulent crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the main areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The western cape is really the main areas
where we find these high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: speciation occurring within these
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another blow up of this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that it's on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an area that primarily receives
winter rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mountain ranges here going both
north to south and east to west are major
[SPEAKER_00]: definers of this kind of landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the western cape, as I've probably
hammered into everyone's head at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point, is highly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not just highly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that make it very unique
is that you have this high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: endonism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why when you look at the
floristic kingdoms on a broad scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: this area really shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one out of five families, 20% of the
families in the western cape are endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a species level, up to 70% of
species are endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means again is plants
that are occurring in just one location,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even in most cases short distance
away, you'll find maybe related species,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the same ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, it comes back to the
question of why is this actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an easy question to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that defines the
western cape region flora there other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest levels of endonism is also
what one botanist described as the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of excessive speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most striking example of this is
the genus Erica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known to grow in other parts of the
world as well, but in South Africa out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 800 species that are known globally,
730 of those occur just within this one
[SPEAKER_00]: small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other large examples of this,
such as the geraniums, the palergoniums,
[SPEAKER_00]: or gladiolus, or axalis, other plants that
people in this room may be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: having species numbers that are high above
100 just found in the western cape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the question is why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some of the kind of major
drivers that are causing this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: speciation to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's three or four that I'm going
to present right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, as I pointed out in the
picture previously, was that these
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain ranges are a very important part
of the landscape in the western cape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main hypothesis or theory here is
that these topographically complex regions
[SPEAKER_00]: act as barriers causing isolation of
plants within them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have a plant that is
distributed to a certain extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from changes in the landscape or
just over time, gene flow is not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: move back, and you end up having
speciation events that therefore cause
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these patterns that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few more images of the topography of the
western cape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is the Adhaic, the soil
properties of the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been described as kind of a
mosaic, if you looked at a soil survey map
[SPEAKER_00]: of the western cape, where you have,
in very close proximity to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main theory here goes is that
you're going to have sister species that
[SPEAKER_00]: are related to each other, but in
different soils will have speciated and
[SPEAKER_00]: formed new ones as being the next kind of
major driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I, I'm sorry to scale back,
the other thing about the mountain ranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other major driver here that is
important is that in these mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, it's considered to have a long
period of climatic stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, you know, one thing you hear
oftentimes cited in some of the botany
[SPEAKER_00]: literature is that these long regions tend
to drive speciation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last major driver is fire
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually an image that was taken
just last Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the western cape region, in an area
that's known as Silver Mine, and this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it was kind of burning in full forest,
this is about a day later, looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute moonscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, this just happened last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a picture of the same region
when I was out there in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So complete transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, what this main kind
of, the theory that goes behind this are
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's abilities and their
adaptations to deal with fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main two different adaptations
that you tend to find are on one hand the
[SPEAKER_00]: resprouters, the ones who are,
root systems are not completely destroyed
[SPEAKER_00]: by these, by these events, but actually
have the ability to sprout up once again,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the reseeders, the plants that actually
need fire to act as scarification,
[SPEAKER_00]: or also just remove competition to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is that you tend to have
sister species that have different fire
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on one or the other, you have
this speciation events occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on kind of all these different
things, I thought maybe South Africa might
[SPEAKER_00]: be an interesting place to go and have a
look at plants, and to study the flora,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to help out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in an application for the drear
to work at Stellenbosch Botanical Gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just experience this remarkable flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to give people a background on
Stellenbosch, it is the oldest university
[SPEAKER_00]: botanic garden in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was originally established in 1902,
primarily as a teaching garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 20 years later, it moved to the
location that it's at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on, they had a big focus on
succulent plants, as I showed that picture
[SPEAKER_00]: of the postcard before by Hans Herra.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first curator and did a lot of
work with this near endemic family,
[SPEAKER_00]: Azoaceae, as well as some of these other
things like Welwichia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Stellenbosch, the garden was
originally based off the garden design at
[SPEAKER_00]: Padova, the world's oldest botanic garden
in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, it has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stellenbosch is in a pretty
interesting position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll kind of go on, I'll talk a little
bit more about this when I talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the national botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that actually makes
them stand out, and this may seem like a
[SPEAKER_00]: funny thing, since I just went on and on
about how interesting the flora of South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is, is that they actually grow
exotic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow plants that aren't from South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do grow a lot of plants that are from
South Africa, particularly for their
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this actually does is it really
creates an opportunity to engage the
[SPEAKER_00]: public and to draw them into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for someone like most people in
the room or myself, you go to South Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to see the flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see the fine boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see these families that are
just totally different than what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you grow up around that,
you may not actually realize that what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have around you is so spectacular unless
you have opportunities to engage with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the unique places that
Stellenbosch is actually at is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow things like Victoria lilies,
or strongly load on the jade vine,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even have bonsai collections,
which draw people in and engage them with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and the landscape in a
different way than some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens in South Africa can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support the educational mission of
the university, and they do this through
[SPEAKER_00]: labs and practicals, as well as
collaboration with researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example down here is that Stellenbosch
houses the living collection for oxalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of those genera that I
mentioned before has more than 100 species
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they maintain the living collection so
that the taxonomists who are working on it
[SPEAKER_00]: at the university can use it as part of
their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really good relationship for
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stellenbosch being a botanic garden,
they have a plant record system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they use the Iris BG system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of right now, some of the national
botanic gardens have also gotten on board
[SPEAKER_00]: finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're actually, Stellenbosch was the
first garden to have a comprehensive plant
[SPEAKER_00]: record keeping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of those things that most
people kind of maybe not think about plant
[SPEAKER_00]: records all the time, but it's one of
those things that makes a botanic garden
[SPEAKER_00]: different than just a park.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that every plant that comes into
the collection is labeled, is numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep up with the taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take images of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's wild collected, we'll take GPS
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, you know that when you
bring that plant into your collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just something interesting to
look at, but it also is a representative
[SPEAKER_00]: of that population from the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings a lot more value to your
collections and also assists in things
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you're actively involved in
plant conservation programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also run a plant conservation
program, as I was just kind of going on
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three species that they
focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk in too much detail
about this, but this was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary things that I worked on while I
was down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a, just have to point it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Drosera regia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sundew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow around here as well,
but there's a lot of diversity down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the biggest in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're carnivorous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a hat for scale, but you can
just see the massive length of these
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just among carnivorous plant growers,
this plant has gained a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is just so, so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, Stellenbach
Botanic Garden is another one of its
[SPEAKER_00]: strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that makes it stand out is
that it is not part of the national
[SPEAKER_00]: botanic garden system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only eight permanent staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its affiliation with the university allows
it to take on initiatives and to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: be very nimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may not have as much capital or
resources as some of the bigger gardens to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on projects, but their small size
allows them to make kind of meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: small impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my main goals, I'm just going to go
over those while I was in the jury
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, was to go work at Stellenbach
Botanic Garden, but it was to develop my
[SPEAKER_00]: field botany skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, you know, I'm in the
horticulture department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some person may ask, why should you
develop, why should you work on field
[SPEAKER_00]: botany?
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly in botanic gardens,
which I hope to continue in once I
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate here and have worked in the past,
this line between botany and horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: is not so well-defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the plants that we come to
appreciate in this day and age,
[SPEAKER_00]: either as ornamental plants, obviously at
some point came from the wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: and botanic gardens for a long time have
had a very active role in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: exploration and also bring plants into
cultivation so then we can use them in
[SPEAKER_00]: various different types of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also to help out in plant
conservation program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also a reciprocal agreement,
so in order to give some expertise and
[SPEAKER_00]: some training to the garden itself,
so I helped out in doing, I did a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work on the plant records as well as
getting in and doing horticultural work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also did training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a background in arboriculture,
so doing some work with some of the staff
[SPEAKER_00]: and learning how to tree climb,
how to do proper chainsaw safety use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of these other kind of skill
sets that they didn't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_00]: down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least was to gain
experience in botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just at Stellenbosch, but also
with a number of the other botanic gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: that I interacted with while I was in
South Africa, learning about how they
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct horticulture with these special
plants that they grow there, and also to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about how they manage their gardens
and what their general approach is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of learning about the
management of how this is all done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was down there, I also had an
opportunity to have a look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much all the pictures that we've
seen so far are pictures that I've taken,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the exception of a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not all the places that I went,
but this is just illustrations of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural areas and botanic gardens kind
of across the country that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to visit and interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last kind of part of my talk,
I'm just going to talk about the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity in South Africa, as well as a
little bit how plant conservation is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that was the main kind of focus of
my work down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state of the biodiversity in South
Africa, as I've kind of described before,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very fascinating, but is also very
challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges that we have in
terms of figuring out how to do effective
[SPEAKER_00]: plant conservation work is that we still
just don't know, people still just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, with 30,000 species occurring across
all of South Africa, people just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know what the full extent of the
flora is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flora is far from complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: New species are found all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2009, there's been more than 300 new
species described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rate of discovery cannot be kept
up with the expertise of taxonomists,
[SPEAKER_00]: either in South Africa or abroad,
since there's experts in these groups kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the threats to biodiversity,
the three main biggest ones are ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The loss of habitat, alien species
invasion, as we can see up here just
[SPEAKER_00]: marching.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Western Cape region just
having Port Jackson march across invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, just march across the landscape,
as well as a large one is unethical plant
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a picture from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a picture of Kirstenbosch
Botanic Garden, where people actually came
[SPEAKER_00]: in at night and somehow stole cycads
directly out of their collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an amazing feat, but really
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go over some of the major
players and the way that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation is actually conducted in
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, the National
Botanic Gardens are a major player in
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and they fall under the purview of
what's known as the South African National
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodiversity Institute, or SANBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SANBI is a large blanket organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a government organization that
primarily covers all biological research
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes on across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have entomologists,
ornithologists, marine biologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: botanists, and so on and so on that are
under this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they are very large, they have a lot
of resources and can make large impacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as I was kind of describing before,
they may not be the most nimble in being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take quick action, which sometimes
is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SANBI oversees the National Botanic
Gardens across all of South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tenth has just recently been added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the National Botanic Gardens are very
interesting institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a strict mandate to only grow
native plants, and this is kind of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point of what makes Stellenbosch a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a wonderful mandate to have,
because with so much biodiversity down
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it's important to have folks that
are really focusing on working on these
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that don't grow anywhere else,
and also to learn how to display them and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the public generally engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are mostly pictures all taken at
Kirstenbosch Botanic Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting thing about the
National Botanic Garden is that they all
[SPEAKER_00]: have contiguous natural areas that are
attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see from both these pictures
here, there's formalized landscapes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture on the right is Table Mountain
off into the background, that continues
[SPEAKER_00]: off into Cape Town, or Leopards Cliff here
on the – sorry, that's on the right-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The left hand is Kirstenbosch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these natural areas are managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in and make sure invasive plants
aren't coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do population counts of species in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a continuous part of the
garden and the garden experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a model that actually Cornell
Plantations uses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be contiguous, but
Plantations also manages lots of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like it makes sense,
especially if you want to do plant
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation work, but it's actually
something that's fairly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of gardens out there
that have this kind of dual role of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural lands management.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as cultivated landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The National Botanic Gardens house the
herbarium, and they have departments that
[SPEAKER_00]: do the work mostly on the systematics and
taxonomy of actually describing the flora
[SPEAKER_00]: in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also, like I mentioned,
have developed horticultural expertise in
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out how to actually grow a lot of
these types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put this in place out to the
general public in a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of books of how to grow
a lot of these specific genera or families
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants that may be unknown to most
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've also had the ability to
prioritize learning the horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are necessary to keep these
things alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of the succulent
collection at Crewe National Botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting to talk to the
horticulturalists and the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually work with these plants is very,
very fascinating, because the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nuance that they've developed in how to
take care of a lot of these really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting taxa is quite extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great that they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting books out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creating a medium by which they
can express this to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the National Botanic Gardens aren't
the only players in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also are other folks who get
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a partnership
with industry and a group that I was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend some time with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cape Institute of Micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They primarily focus on DISA orchids,
the genus of orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a couple of pictures of DISA
uniflora, probably South Africa's most
[SPEAKER_00]: famous orchid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're a private organization that
also does conservation work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is they go out to the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do plant surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll GPS where actually they find these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pollinate, take capsules,
bring them back, figure out how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them into culture, grow them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll do different things with
them, depending on what species they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an ornamental interest in them,
they'll figure out ways to continue these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in culture and then send them
internationally abroad to make some money
[SPEAKER_00]: for the organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they also will go back out and do
replant reintroductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cape Institute of Micropropagation
also worked with Stellenbosch on DISA
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbeta, which has one of the smallest
populations of any DISA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing repopulations using
these kind of methods and protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also tend to find conservation being
conducted in places like private gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the part of South Africa that I was in,
there's lots of estates and vineyards that
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of a major part of the
horticultural trade in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the interesting partnerships
that you'll find is some of these gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: actually being active in plant
conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the example of this is the silver
tree here on the right, Leucodendron
[SPEAKER_00]: argentia, was known to kind of have one
main population on Table Mountain that
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years has kind of declined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirstenbosch has been active in
maintaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only other known population,
a disjunct population, was also found,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these aren't the best pictures,
but this is very close to Stellenbosch,
[SPEAKER_00]: the town that I was in, these mountain
ranges that are in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rustenburg-Wana State goes pretty much
right up to this mountain slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on these slopes, they found a second
population of this Leucodendron argentia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not because they have to, because they
want to, and they're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually go out, they remove invasive
plants, and they monitor these populations
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to keep them thriving as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a big citizen science
initiative and people who are just
[SPEAKER_00]: generally interested in plant conservation
in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one organized example of that,
known as CRU, custodians of the rare and
[SPEAKER_00]: endangered wildflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are folks who are, they're
mostly retired, but they're a volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: group that will, it's based by region,
they'll identify natural areas within
[SPEAKER_00]: their region that haven't been surveyed,
and they'll coordinate with SAMBI,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll go out and they'll actually do
these surveys where they actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on out there, they'll keep
population counts, and then they'll submit
[SPEAKER_00]: that so that it can be used for consensus
across the whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of this, is a program
known as iSpot.
[SPEAKER_00]: iSpot is an application you can get for
your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is, is if you are out
botanizing, doesn't matter if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: walking around, you're on your farm,
you're on your land, and you see a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't know is of interest to you,
you can take a picture of it, you can post
[SPEAKER_00]: it up on iSpot, either attempt to identify
yourself or it will alert experts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll come in and take a look at
these plants and identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great way of kind of doing
quick surveying on the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what's been interesting about it is
that as more and more people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: using this program, that there's actually
been a whole handful of species that have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been discovered because of this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of one that we saw,
I saw one of the flower shows where folks
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, someone just took a picture of
this and went out to the expert,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't know what it is, they came and
they did the field work, they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it, find it, define it,
and therefore it was introduced as a new
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of getting towards the end of the
talk here, why does it all matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've described how there's so much
biodiversity in South Africa and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it is kind of under threat, and this is
the same challenge that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation's focus have everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In South Africa in itself, about roughly
25% of the flora is either threatened or
[SPEAKER_00]: of conservation concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kind of point I want to make here
is that we all know that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation or any kind of conservation
is a very important activity to undertake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of focusing on what the sheer
numbers are here, through many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: examples that I've shared with you before,
I think more of the point is that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of interested parties and
interesting collaborations that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted that really look to address
these problems on multiple levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a really interesting
and powerful finding for me to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in general, it's not just on a
global perspective that the plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all are threatened or in peril,
but there's also been a restriction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: education of how to actually conduct some
of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are two articles that came out
just this last week in Popular Media.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is talking about collections
specifically and the value that those
[SPEAKER_00]: hold, and the other one is talking about
field biology skills and how fewer and
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer folks are actually being trained in
these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have challenges in conservation,
not just on the plant side, but also in
[SPEAKER_00]: our education system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my last kind of point is that
even though, again, we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges, I think it's more of a point
of optimism that we still have places like
[SPEAKER_00]: educational institutions, universities,
and botanic gardens which are able to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: all this information together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I've been giving this
perspective from the side of botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, these institutions really stand
out as being places that can do this work
[SPEAKER_00]: not only on a theoretical level,
but actually can get out there and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: applied work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can bring all their resources
they have to bear to this mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just monitoring these plants in the
wild and monitoring populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually developing horticultural
protocols, how to do in-situ and ex-situ
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation, how to document the flora of
our world, and follow up with the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: research that is important to allow plant
conservation to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank the
horticulture section or department and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreher committee for allowing me to have
this kind of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of direction this talk could
have gone, and it went in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways anyway.
