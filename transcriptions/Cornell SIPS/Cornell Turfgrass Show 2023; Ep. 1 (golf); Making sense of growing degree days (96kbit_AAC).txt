[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's kick it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is season four of the Cornell turf
show, something that started really out of
[SPEAKER_00]: necessity during the COVID pandemic when
Frank and I were looking for things to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for people to see in any capacity,
even the virtual world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're on season four and thanks to
everyone who's been listening and enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: the information along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank and I have really appreciated doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to talk to a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have guests on every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to learn a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Dr. Arthur
Gigaitano, director of the Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Regional Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get to a conversation
with Art a little bit later, but I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring in my co-host as always,
Dr. Frank Rossi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, welcome back to season four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just I'll second that, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really great because of the people
we get to share it with, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you got three Italian guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without any further ado, without any
further ado, let me get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Carl said, we started this just
howling at the moon, Carl and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think during the pandemic, just to try
to support guys who didn't know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could work.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could you work?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people could work?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people in a truck?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the things that were involved in
getting things done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's really created a body of
content that someday, somebody's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: mine and they're going to say,
wow, that Rossi was stupid, but Scamenti,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, he really had it going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to pick pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very fortunate that we share these
things collectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you listening on the
podcast, I've got a slide that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: shows people lay inside around a bunker
and a blizzard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is what caught us off
guard a little bit, but really in honor of
[SPEAKER_01]: having a wannabe meteorologist with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that this particular tweet was
really typified, something we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about art for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the damn wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciated the way this
meteorologist presented this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who don't know, art is
involved here in the earth and atmospheric
[SPEAKER_01]: science department and has personally
trained a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even this particular woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking those are bullets directly
from my class on the Degutano wind speed
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: She could be a student.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't cite you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But listen, before we get going with art
and growing grass, I want to bring in my
[SPEAKER_01]: co-host, Carl, bring you back and also say
what a joy it's been working with you and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in your new role as the urban
environmental scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the process of hiring a new
person for the state park agronomy job and
[SPEAKER_01]: golf course for the ecosystem job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl, you've assumed this new role and
we're going to give you a chance to rant
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially about one of the topics I've
been listening to you rant about for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while and the golf balls changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Carl, without any further ado,
it's all yours, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks, Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting into some of these segments
now as we progress in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to get to some of the
things I'm interested in my new job
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity, ecosystem services, the value of
turf grass and urban landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the topical discussion for our golf
show this week really stems from the
[SPEAKER_00]: recent announcement from the USGA and RNA
about a new golf ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they announced really their intent to
create this model local rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they want to have a golf ball
for only elite competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what elite
competitions mean yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to go shorter, somewhere
between 15 and 20 yards shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of hemming and hawing about
if it's good for the game, bad for the
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really looked at the two arguments
that USGA and RNA have made to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why this is something they should
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first argument really has to do
with the skill sets of golfers now versus
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day and how that shifted
because of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that good or bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into that today,
but that's sort of their primary argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secondary argument is what I do want
to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say in their statement, they said
increased hitting distances and course
[SPEAKER_00]: lengthening threatens golf's long term
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, that's a pretty interesting
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they got in our lane, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got in our lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've studied this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I want to get into,
the idea of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most golf courses out there,
the only version of sustainability is
[SPEAKER_00]: financial, economic sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you making money and able to thrive?
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we got to go back to this is
competitive elite competitions,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they talk about courses who are
affected by the new golf ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: having to change their golf course,
Marion, St. Andrews, Augusta National
[SPEAKER_00]: Cypress Point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a picture up here for those watching
of a new tee box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Augusta just made the 13th hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a new tee box there,
about 40 yards they added.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid $30 million for that 40 yards of
course length.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound to me, Frank,
like a course that's struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wish I had that 40 yards of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying almost a million dollars per
yard to lengthen that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So economic, that's not what they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about environmental
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their argument is that because courses
have to lengthen, they then have to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain more golf course and that
requires more resources, more inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, fertilizer, water,
greenhouse gases, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've studied this, Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two papers out now looking at
pesticide use and pesticide risk on golf
[SPEAKER_00]: courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've looked at it sort of
internationally, not even just in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what our researchers showed in all
these cases is that the fairway resource
[SPEAKER_00]: use, the pesticides we applied to fairway,
the same is true for fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation, the greenhouse gases we spent
mowing and applying cultural practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fairways are the primary driver of
resource use on golf courses because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very big, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not treat them quite as intensely
as the greens, but they make up such a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger area, 25, 30, 35 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially on championship courses,
which have high expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be interesting for us to know how
have courses changed sort of how they lay
[SPEAKER_00]: their course out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they increased their fairway acreage
over the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out this has been studied and
it's been studied by the USGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the USGA green section did this a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mapped courses over time using aerial
images and GIS software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they used 80 random courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even had championship courses in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their finding was that championship
courses had actually decreased their
[SPEAKER_00]: fairway acreage by six acres from their
inception, despite adding 300 yards of
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually the opposite of maybe what
we thought, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying one of the USGA's
arguments in the statement, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're managing more land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this data, we're actually managing
less of that land, that fairway land,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the most resource use intensive
as we know from our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get to my verdict here,
is the golf ball affecting sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: of championship courses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving that a thumbs down,
Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what's affecting the
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will say is affecting the
sustainability are these other factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the player expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green speeds, this comes back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at courses, TPC sawgrass
looked beautiful last week, played
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, and it's super uniform,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires a lot of resources to
maintain uniformity across 200 plus acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the players demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want every fairway, every green,
every bunker, all the rough to react the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way across a changing landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very resource use intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it doesn't happen, like Chambers
Bay, you can see a couple of tweets here
[SPEAKER_00]: of pros getting up in arms about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're thinking about environmental
sustainability, Frank, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other factors I would address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's interesting, Carl, that I love
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a wow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bit of a wow, because
intuitively you think, well, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: longer, it's got to be more land,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because length is going to give you land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so fascinating that by their own
measure, they're not indicating that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is rendering some of these elite
golf courses irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the thing, you didn't answer the
question there, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not letting you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should there be two different types of
balls?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to answer was, why are they
doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to buy the
sustainability argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to say, hey, we want to go to
Cypress Point and we want to stay at
[SPEAKER_00]: Pebble and we don't want to change St.
Andrews, that's much more of sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: touchy-feely conversation that I could
either take it or leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't care.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no verdict on bivurcation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy the arguments they're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen, let's talk about golf and a lot
more people are playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that Jim Copenhaver and his Pellucid
group is involved with National Golf
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation, they got really good round
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round numbers are up dramatically from
when we started this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're holding on to a lot of people
that came back to the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one, the thing to say is at the
end of 22, we had about 40 million more
[SPEAKER_01]: rounds, about 12% more rounds,
13% more rounds in 2022 than we did when
[SPEAKER_01]: we started the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's fascinating is the weather sucks,
Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather sucks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at this data from golf playable
hours from Pellucid over a long period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now golf playable hours is you got enough
light and Jim's secret sauce says the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather factors are good for golf,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you'll go out and play golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So places like San Diego are pretty much
only, well, not this year, but pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: only governed by how long the day is
because it's 70 and sunny every day in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Diego for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously you'd imagine a high volume
of playable hours there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the other end, a very low volume of
playable hours, even here in central New
[SPEAKER_01]: York, where we thought we'd be playing
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at the long, the 10 year
average, we have less time people to play
[SPEAKER_01]: golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nationally, it was a big drop,
10, 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people playing on less time to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another way that Pellucid looks
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is playable hours year over year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compared to 21, 22 had 20% less
playable hours in the month of November.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at the utilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way off the charts, 7% up year over year.
[SPEAKER_01]: More golfers with less time are really
leading to concentrating traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl has really pioneered a lot of
discussion on how we should be thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about traffic in the golf business moving
forward and using this Pellucid data to
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrate to people, hey, this is not
only, we got more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're playing in a compressed amount of
time in certain places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Art, here's the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that from the School of the Minds,
the one on the left?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's right when I first got here
on the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got here about the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art and I are in the same tenure class,
oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met that president, Jeff Lehman,
who was here for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably how we got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably how you and I got tenured.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy came, he tenured us and then he
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art and I have been at this a while and we
started just doing conference calls and it
[SPEAKER_01]: led to being able to use weather and
climate data to try to help turf grass
[SPEAKER_01]: managers grow grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people even paid attention
to it when we first started doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it allowed us to begin to collect data
and look at trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we published a paper in 07 basically
foretelling what we're experiencing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now is that we have more consistent dollar
spot pressure, Art, and been a big shift
[SPEAKER_01]: in many areas to the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a heavy period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was really appreciant at the time
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's, I'm going to try to set you
up as best I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got winter with a question mark because
it looks like it just got here and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully not going to stay very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back at the December to February
time period, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love these ranking systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the North, these are
everything that's orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art, this has got to be like top five,
10% of the warmest winters we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you do the math there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That period of record starts in 1895.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do the math, those are pretty
much, you know, top one, top two actually
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in, in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I was a little surprised by this
because I was hearing about not as much
[SPEAKER_01]: snow, not as much rain, but we hear in
central New York, you could, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in central New York here, we, well,
sorry, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get the pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, for those people listening
on the podcast, you can't see it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm circling the central New York
where it looks almost 200% above normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go on Long Island where Beth Page is
and they tell me it's pretty dry down
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on whole, what would you say about
the moisture from the winter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the, the moisture from the winter
helped us out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can remember back in the fall,
you know, most places, a lot of places in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York and New England, especially in
Massachusetts, we're really talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of drought as we moved
into the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really this map, and if you look at any
of the drought maps really show that the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter pretty much took care of that
drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had adequate, adequate, or if not
above normal rainfall for most places,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not all places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, New York and our,
our Northern New York and New England,
[SPEAKER_02]: really good rainfall stream flow has
jumped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Groundwater has jumped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything's looking really optimistic
there, but like you kind of point out,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you move further south, things don't
look all that, that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, on this map, even the
further south you go, the worse it gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is still some lingering dryness,
not quite drought, but, but boy,
[SPEAKER_02]: right on the borderline there in Long
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as you move into the New Jersey
and Philly area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature's been the story and it looks
like eight to 10 days we're going to stall
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got this teaser at the end
of February.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is off of your drought page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also looks like we're going to be
at least slightly on the dry side for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the Northeast, but it looks hard to
predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how you feel about anything more
than 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to say about predictions
for the next eight to 14?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as, I mean, if you went through
that time series of my pictures,
[SPEAKER_02]: my faith in the eight to 14 day forecast
has, has, has really expanded a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I actually do put a lot
more faith in these in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think what you're showing
the next week here, I think this is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be short-lived.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're going to, you know,
we're going to have a bit of a cool down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, today, at least up here in
Ithaca, it's supposed to almost crack 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then drop down a bit as we move into
the weekend and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this one week period here that
you're showing is, is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a, I think you, you said it well,
a pause basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a stall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, just looking at it,
I know the forecast temperatures again for
[SPEAKER_02]: upstate in our area next week or,
or probably mid forties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sounds pretty good actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but we're getting into that time of
year where yes, it's below normal,
[SPEAKER_02]: but below normal is still, you know,
getting to be not too bad, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and to your point, thank you for
giving me a perfect transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stumbled across this data, you know,
how are, we always talk about the length
[SPEAKER_01]: of the growing season and how things have
changed over time and how climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: is bringing the climates of New York city,
the metro area, maybe closer to the Philly
[SPEAKER_01]: area on its way to the Baltimore area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that with warm season
grasses slowly starting to creep up and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and frost free days are an indication of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some data from growing season
link, just looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a real shift in the slope
here, Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the first time I've ever seen
people put actual days on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at it skeptically,
you know, the 80 to 2000 period,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 days per decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean we've added almost a month
in 30, in 40 years of our growing season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years a decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, almost, almost a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, you can take this graph in
a number of different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd argue in a lot of cases that 80 to,
you know, to current period of time is a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of cherry picking because there is
that number of years there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I really think is more dramatic
about this graph is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you go to the fifties to the present,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a nice long period of time and you
have a nice consistent trend there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you can play games with where
you're going to start things and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: get, get a consistent trend, but yet that
can trend, that trend is consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and boy, aren't you the perfect
guest because the topic for today is
[SPEAKER_01]: trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we've advanced some of our
understanding of growing degree days in
[SPEAKER_01]: many ways, our use of them, base 50,
base 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was a year where we really called
into question whether our March 15 start
[SPEAKER_01]: date that we always used historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it really comes as an
artifact from the one, the weed control
[SPEAKER_01]: model that was for 24D.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use that date, I think for base
32, but maybe we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know our, our models were enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the question for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm looking at, I pulled this,
yesterday, this is the proxy seed head
[SPEAKER_01]: thing from Michigan state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically saying that,
you know, the metropolitan New York area,
[SPEAKER_01]: southeastern New England, all the way into
central Pennsylvania should be making
[SPEAKER_01]: their seed head application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, how do I want to make a
little more sense of growing degree days?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a goofy question.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is a growing degree day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a growing degree day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my point is about the stall,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we counted them since January,
and we had them that said we had 50,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever we had, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last month, it's been sitting
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean we start at zero?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did we get to capitalize on the 50?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the question, because we base,
especially in the springtime, a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: models on this growing degree day thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give you a chance to sort of
give us a, you know, a 101, if I was
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in your class on growing degree
days and talk about some of the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: general issues we have and things we still
need to learn before we can use these
[SPEAKER_01]: things discreetly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I'd start out with,
you know, a growing degree day has sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, they've been around for a
long time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually a pretty simplistic
measurement of really just saying how far
[SPEAKER_02]: is the average temperature of a day
basically different from some threshold
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, affects the grass,
affects an insect, you know, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it's calibrated to, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It really needs calibration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think, you know,
if you've heard any of my extension talks
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything like that, one of the things I
rant about is really using the calendar to
[SPEAKER_02]: make these decisions that are weather
related, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that for a long time,
you know, whether it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we chat with you, it's like,
oh, it's the, you know, I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the date wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first, you know, the first week in
May, we need to put down a dandelion
[SPEAKER_02]: control or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in, in, in some years that might be
prudent and other years it might not be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so the weather is a key there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really going back to your first
question, it's really that pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, again, climate change factors
into that, you know, we can be looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: a period of time, say in January,
where we do, you know, over a week or two
[SPEAKER_02]: do accumulate a substantial amount,
particularly of base 32 degree days,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then, you know, it, it, we,
we plunge into the deep freeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the polar vortex comes over
us and the rest of March and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: February are, you know, pretty much we're
not collecting anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, my question there becomes,
maybe I'm going to throw it back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say in your biology class?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the turf respond to that kind of jolt
in, in, in January?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when it, when it comes out
of that deep freeze being covered in snow,
[SPEAKER_02]: does, does it remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for asking it because my answer
would be, I think it would be set back
[SPEAKER_01]: further.
[SPEAKER_01]: If in fact, those plants, and some of it
is not understood honestly, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a function of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the ground sat bare when it was
warm, the sun beat down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were seeing soil temperatures are at
two inches into the mid fifties brother on
[SPEAKER_01]: Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, my feeling is those plants
respond to that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that we know about the
potential light impact because you still
[SPEAKER_01]: are fairly shallow angle that,
you know, mid late February.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that first thing is, I don't know,
but my concern is we get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this stuff comes and it sets it back
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was to say anything, I would not
pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, let's just start doing it where
it accumulates consistently for two to
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're back in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit the key word there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was going to end up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that consistency needs to be a
part of it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going through January and you
have a day here and a day there,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even into February, March, and you have
a day here, that's very different than
[SPEAKER_02]: this prolonged period of time where,
where, you know, the biology of the turf
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever can kind of pick up and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in a lot of cases, you know,
the, the, the fruit guys are maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more sophisticated with you,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there they have a, they have a
distinct measure on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have this idea of chilling,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a certain amount of chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you start to accumulate
the degree days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, all right, we've gone through the
winter, we've done our stuff, we've gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: enough of this, and now I can start to
wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there doesn't seem to be that in,
in, in the case of, of, of turf or even
[SPEAKER_02]: insects and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we've been talking
about, we have for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, and there's, there's been some
research going on in Minnesota,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly on this, the concept of a
false spring, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That concept of false spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just take a minute and describe,
I mean, this is a, is this a relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: new phenomenon as part of the,
a signal of climate change or is,
[SPEAKER_01]: have the springs always been screwed up
like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they've always been
screwed up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more, it's more, it's become more
prevalent in, in a changing climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can go way back, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in my South Dakota days, we did some
work actually with, with tree rings,
[SPEAKER_02]: so long records.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the things you looked
at in the trees, this idea of false
[SPEAKER_02]: springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get these very, very short,
small rings where the trees start to,
[SPEAKER_02]: start to go crazy in the spring,
and then it gets really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we all know we count the
number of rings to see how old a tree is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in those cases, there's like two
rings, there's that false ring because the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has been a phenomena that has gone
on, you know, for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at thousand year records in
some of these trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it becomes more prevalent as,
as, as we move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we did some work with, we did some
work with frost risk in apples,
[SPEAKER_02]: frost damage in apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the key thing that we see,
it's the variation in the temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can warm up as much as we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's really not this idea of false
spring, but as the, as the variance,
[SPEAKER_02]: the day to day change becomes different,
that's the thing that gives you that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that false spring that, you know,
in the case of an apple blossom,
[SPEAKER_02]: they develop and then boom, you get hit
with a frost and it's down, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there, it's a one day thing in,
in what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say with turf, we need a more
prolonged period of time of, of it being
[SPEAKER_02]: cooler and having a false spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Carl, are there questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a great question from Jason
Griffiths that goes right along with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said he got some, some significant
growing degree days in mid February,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the soil temps at two inches,
two inches were still down at 31 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's asking how much is that a key to keep
the plant in dormancy, which for turf is
[SPEAKER_00]: good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to acclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then it's going to be more
susceptible to winter care.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways, I think that's the easy
thing to look at here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're looking, we're doing air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not doing soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a good case, you could accumulate
degree days in February, but there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: foot of snow on the ground, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the easy thing to say,
Hey, these don't count.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting to look at the soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the soils are frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do get some data on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be another way of kind of
tempering what goes on in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Art, when you said, you know,
the simplistic growing degree day
[SPEAKER_01]: calculations, how much of a difference you
think there is between doing it daily,
[SPEAKER_01]: hourly, AM, PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an entomologist on Ben McGraw from
Penn State who pays attention to this a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He drew some attention to the differences,
the way they're calculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take a minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think number one, ours on our
websites are daily, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about the differences in
measuring them more granularly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I have two things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're totally going to be different,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have, you know, you can think
of especially spring days if we're using
[SPEAKER_02]: base, you know, base 50 or let's,
you know, as a degree day, you have many
[SPEAKER_02]: days in the mid to late spring where the
daytime temperature is above 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still below freezing at night,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you average that out, then you get
zero degree days, even though a good chunk
[SPEAKER_02]: of the day was in the 50s and presumably
the plants were responding to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, so yeah, there you do get a
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the numbers we look at about maybe
10 percent, particularly if you do it
[SPEAKER_02]: hourly versus daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it really doesn't matter that it
depends on what the models were built at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody built the model all on
daily values, right, that's that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's what you're using in the
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're saying this disease,
this insects, this whatever is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: occur at this many degree days,
what's really important to go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: literature and say, hey, how did they
compute?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so in fact, my question was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A degree day is not a degree day when
there's a foot of snow on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Jason's point, well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A degree day is not a degree day if the
soil is at 30 degrees and frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's probably worth in places
like that really paying attention to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
as you get further south art, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have, you know, it's it's it seems to
be progressing in the metropolitan areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take one more second with our
urban environmental scientists here and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how this warming potentially
impacts grass areas around cities more
[SPEAKER_01]: than it might in rural areas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think this is a good
winter to actually just go out and look at
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if you walk around New York City
or actually even on campus here,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've been past Roberts Hall,
the witch hazel is already in bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's bright yellow, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some more we did some new stuff in
the city where the trees are are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: in bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that that city environment
just adds so much to the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of tempers those fluctuations that
we talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in those types of environments,
yeah, it's it's key, actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the mass heats up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that paved mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's like a big old heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a big old heat sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, sitting around the
campfire and the rocks are still hot in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fastest 30 minutes, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We defy the space time continuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming, Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a ton, Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure, Carl and Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everyone, for joining today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back right again tomorrow with
our sports show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our attendees today, Ben Palmer,
is going to be on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to quiz Ben on some spring,
some of the spring maintenance practices
[SPEAKER_00]: he does and a new New England regional BMP
document for the sports tournament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you, Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the Web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
