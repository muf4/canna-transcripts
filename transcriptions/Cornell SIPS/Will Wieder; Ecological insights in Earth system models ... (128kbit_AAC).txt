[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here, especially with so
many soils folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I am the soils person at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm trying to justify like why soils
matter all the time, and so it's awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in a room full of dirt nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this topic I think is really important
in the sense that, especially what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: calling knowledge model integration,
I'll talk some about what the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: is, but really that knowledge is the stuff
that you guys are working on here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations that I've had with students
and post-docs and faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the stuff that you guys are doing and
the models that I'm talking about are
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale models like Dan said,
so global scale models that run at really
[SPEAKER_00]: coarse resolutions and how do we integrate
this fine scale knowledge into coarse
[SPEAKER_00]: scale models and what are the kind of
simplifying assumptions that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's at a high level what's driving
some of the questions that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make the distinction between this
knowledge model integration between what's
[SPEAKER_00]: more commonly known as data model
integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might have an example,
and this is kind of just an illustrative
[SPEAKER_00]: vignette of how oftentimes model
development happens, but you have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what the truth is and some data that
lets you know, okay, this is in this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of truth, this might be, to take a
different example, somebody with great
[SPEAKER_00]: hair who's a sharp dresser and has
wonderful songs that's been loved by
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that's your idea of truth,
you might make some models that represent
[SPEAKER_00]: that idea of truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great hair, sharp dresser, wonderful
songs, loved by generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could do that and you could maybe
resolve with data, make those models look
[SPEAKER_00]: more like the truth or the idea of truth
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would be a case where you have
high uncertainty in your models and
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively low confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, data can bridge that uncertainty
gap, you can reduce the uncertainty with
[SPEAKER_00]: data, but you're not gonna be able to
address the confidence gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this idea, you're still gonna
have low confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, you could come up with
different models that have different
[SPEAKER_00]: structural underpinnings that still meet
that base requirement of great hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp dresser, wonderful songs,
loved by generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you've got, you're sampling the
space of that truth wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might still have high
uncertainty, but I'd argue that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: more confidence in the model because we're
sampling the space around truth more
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in bringing that into the Earth system
and what I like to think of putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth in the Earth system, Earth system
models are really based in the geoscience
[SPEAKER_00]: community from atmospheric physics and
fluid dynamics and in the ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about ocean circulation and
original versions of these models
[SPEAKER_00]: literally black boxed the land surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason they did that was because
they needed to get air to warm over land
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than it did over water to get
circulation patterns right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of putting Earth or putting
terrestrial processes in Earth system
[SPEAKER_00]: models is really still a very nascent
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is science that's happened within my
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in making the Earth green, we've made
huge improvements in terms of representing
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the green slime that's on top of
the Earth and how the carbon cycle works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so representing the carbon cycle again
in these models is a really new idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's science that's around 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then what we can do then in terms
of biology I think is a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a brand new field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal in this talk is to illustrate
some ideas of how we can increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence that we have in these models by
considering life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is as a ecologist and as
a biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only moved into modeling in my
postdoc and now as a project scientist at
[SPEAKER_00]: NCAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these new tools that we have,
especially in this DNA images there
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally, I think new tools that we
have in peering into the very small,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small scales can really inform our
large scale representations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to talk about today is
kind of in two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is talking about functional traits and
how functional traits, especially in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms can affect, or how we can
start thinking about how they may affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the global carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one is to talk about
nutrient limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I chose that kind of for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is coming to kind of a more soils and
agricultural focused building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about how we think about
nutrient limitation in large scale models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's I think some really
pressing needs to advance that science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we step back and think about how we
do this model knowledge integration,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally the way I would argue that
science kind of works is you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of scientific paradigm which is based
on measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those measurements inform a theory,
and so theories about how carbon is
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilized in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come up with numerical models
that are both represent, that both use the
[SPEAKER_00]: data to parameterize the models that are
based on your theoretical understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: how the system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that happens in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really matters how it happens in
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys here know this, but soils
store more carbon than all the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the atmosphere combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the largest terrestrial carbon
reservoir that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the source for all the rock
derived nutrients that plants use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, again, tons and tons of
nitrogen in soils too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of biogeochemical cycling,
soils really are critical for thinking of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the models that we have for thinking
about how soils function biogeochemically
[SPEAKER_00]: are relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're based on these ideas of
chemical or calcitrons and somewhat dated
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas about how carbon turns over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might have a fast pool here
represented by candy bars of yummy,
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty, easy to decompose substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microbes are represented in models
like this, but they're represented
[SPEAKER_00]: implicitly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they eat that yummy sticky carbon,
and then they turn it into carbon that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not so tasty and it's not so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have a slower turnover time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this kind of idea is actually
represented in all of the models that are
[SPEAKER_00]: used at global scales to represent the
global carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these first order models with kind
of a cascade of decomposition reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: are well represented in these global scale
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only problem is they're not very
good at meeting their target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is kind of a bit of an aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do a really, really bad job
representing carbon, at least the initial
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the initial carbon stocks that
we think are all around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though these models are based on
the same set of assumptions, they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of based around the same subset of truth,
they do a really poor job hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of it, we've learned a lot
about how carbon is stabilized in soils
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of an increasing chorus
as it time to rethink how we represent
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the biggest thing we've learned is
that actually this kind of decomposition
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade of increasingly recalcitrant
carbon is probably unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what reality happens is microbes eat
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not taste very good to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once a microbe ingests carbon and it
assimilates it into their biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: that microbial biomass is really tasty to
other microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they go from a carbon molecule that
might be inherently slow to turnover,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they turn it into something that would
naturally turnover faster, except there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lock on the candy box now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is carbon that's
physiochemically protected within
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregates or on mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though it's maybe
thermodynamically would be favorable to
[SPEAKER_00]: decompose, microbes can't get to it in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what actually preserves carbon
in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all of this, the microbial catalyst
really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbe that's there is key in this
transformation of moving carbon from one
[SPEAKER_00]: pool to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the conditions matter,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different kinds of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're incredibly complex systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I like to think
about is how can we take kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: simplistic representations of microbial
diversity and apply those in models at
[SPEAKER_00]: large scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think about this knowledge model
integration kind of paradigm, there seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a lot of cracks in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're collecting new measurements that
are contradicting this idea of a three
[SPEAKER_00]: pool model and chemical recalcitrance
that's revising our theoretical ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: about how carbon is stabilized in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then what are the numerical models
that we need to start testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating and refining some of these
ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the knowledge part is
really critical and why I'm excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to so many folks here is because the
theory and the measurements that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are all making I think are really critical
to informing models in ways that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of completes this cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have a model that better
reflects your theory, you can understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what measurements you need to kind of
improve this whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: By going out and first off taking samples
and then thinking about microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: explicitly in models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thinking about microbes and
microbial diversity I think is a key piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's no slight task.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went out to the flower beds and
grabbed a tablespoon of soil, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly as many microbes in that tablespoon
of soil as there are people on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a hugely complex problem in
thinking about ways that you can represent
[SPEAKER_00]: this at large spacial scales is somewhat
daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to articulate is kind
of just one axis of this theory
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement modeling paradigm that really
emphasizes the theory and the modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I think this
project that we're starting to work on is
[SPEAKER_00]: also then thinking about the measurements
that we'll need to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at global scales, functional traits
are really important for certain parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on land, we think about plant
functional traits and the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between evergreen trees and
grasses and deciduous trees are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for moving carbon in different
ways based on the kind of biological
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that we can see fortunately from
space in terms of how different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: functional types respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: In global models at large scales,
we even think about plankton functional
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different aspects of the ocean
carbon cycle that control the biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: biological pump and how quickly carbon
sinks in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different plankton groups respond to
temperature and salinity and nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the kind of biological imprint
of the blue carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think about the green carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think about the blue carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm arguing is that we really
need to start thinking about the brown
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon cycle and functional traits and
ways that we can simplify the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, which granted is huge, and
especially focusing on how that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeochemical cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: With a really simple approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm highly reductionist in
acknowledging that from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to be able to take these
ideas that are founded on theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then apply them at really,
really large scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this idea of microbes,
we're implicitly thinking about two
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of them as a fast group and
a slow group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about them as bacteria and
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about them as copiotrophic
and oligotrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever axis of variation you want to
slice through these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the purposes of what I'm talking
about today, I'm going to just call them
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one group of organisms that has
really fast kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they produce biomass and turn over
at high rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also less efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these fast microbes are kind of the
live fast, die young, but relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: inefficient in how they handle carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And comparing that with the slow microbes,
which are kind of an ecological framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're K strategists, so they grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more efficient how they
handle carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a different life history
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two microbes eat different kinds
of plant litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this borrows heavily on the kind of
chemical recalcitrant theories,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got yummy, tasty,
quickly decomposable litter that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: low lignin, but high nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's relatively recalcitrant
litter, stuff that has high lignin content
[SPEAKER_00]: and low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's three soil organic matter
pools in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a yummy, tasty pool that maybe
chemically looks a whole lot like this
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic plant litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's available to microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not chemically or physically
protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's this physicochemically
protected stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be heavy fraction in the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be stuff that's on mineral
surfaces or in aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow it's physically protected from
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also this structurally
protected pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is stuff that maybe looks more
like plant residues, highly lignified
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is maybe more like light fraction
in the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got kind of heavy fraction,
physically protected stuff, versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: light fraction, chemically protected stuff
in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the carbon that the microbes can
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a model that we're calling
MIMICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked on this with Stuart Grandy
and Cynthia Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling back who Cynthia used to be at
UNH with Stuart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the model's a little bit more
complicated in the sense that we allow
[SPEAKER_00]: both the fast and the slow microbial pools
to eat both kinds of litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also can only eat this available
soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have access to the
physicochemically protected stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chemically protected stuff has to
be depolymerized somehow before it's
[SPEAKER_00]: become available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes into biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then when we think about evaluating
a model like this across scales,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of a nice theoretical model.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the data that we can use to try
to evaluate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we probably have the most data
thinking about kind of plot level
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, maybe cross continental
measurements, but looking at landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and then their potential
response to perturbations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to use these data then are for
global projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving up in scale, how can we take
these kind of site level measurements and
[SPEAKER_00]: have any confidence that what we're saying
at global scales matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving down, what are some ways
that we can think about functional
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and some of the assumptions that
are built into a model like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we revise and refine those
assumptions to kind of improve confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: across the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to focus at the landscape scale
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are results that I'll show from
some litter decomposition experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, talking about litter
decomposition is kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: eh, not very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you talk about litter
decomposition at a place like NCAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are fascinated to know how you
actually watch leaves decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like an unheard of thing for
atmospheric scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you know, you can put litter
bags out on the field and harvest them
[SPEAKER_00]: sequentially and kind of watch how quickly
they decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the data that I'm looking at here
come from the LIDAT data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: LIDAT was a 10-year experiment with sites
basically from the Arctic all the way down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the tropics and at 20-some different
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decomposed six different kinds of
litter both above and below ground for a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are results just from Harvard
Forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the observations are shown with the
closed circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the model results for mimics are shown
with the mean of all the six different
[SPEAKER_00]: litter types as shown by the heavy line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the standard deviation around those is
the shaded area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important to notice here is
that we both kind of capture the shape of
[SPEAKER_00]: the curve and maybe miss the tail a little
bit at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then more importantly, we're able to
capture because of the ideas of litter
[SPEAKER_00]: quality that are built into mimics,
we kind of capture the effect of litter
[SPEAKER_00]: quality as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're capturing the climate effect,
which is basically giving you the slope of
[SPEAKER_00]: the line and then the effect of litter
quality, which gives you the spread among
[SPEAKER_00]: the observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model is tuned up for Harvard
Forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at it kind of to
validate at Bonanza Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bonanza Creek's in kind of the interior
of Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much colder climate, much drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that mimics does a pretty
good job here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tuning the model to one site and we can
look at it at another and have some
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence that we're kind of doing the
right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, LIDAT was done not at two
sites, but at 26 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the results from all of
the time points from all of the sites over
[SPEAKER_00]: a decade worth of observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors here are showing different
biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of lumping things based on
Arctic tundra, tropical forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: deciduous forest, evergreen forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, mimics and descent here,
which is a kind of I would say the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard of what most models use,
a first order model based on these ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemical or calcitrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to distinguish between the two
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both models do a relatively good job
representing the mass remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd argue is that what we're
starting to do is sample the space around
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of hypothetical truth box
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Descent and Roth C and some
other model that's similar to those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got another great dresser,
fabulous hair, influenced generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we're sampling the space
around that truth better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really matters then is how you
extrapolate these models and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: show you in terms of global response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to spend a little bit of
time talking about the global response of
[SPEAKER_00]: these models, both in terms of their spin
up and what they look like at steady state
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how they might respond to
different perturbations in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this experiment, we took using a
different set of models now that one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I've learned is that model
development happens really, really fast at
[SPEAKER_00]: a place like NCAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's new versions of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to NCAR and we were using one
version of CLM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, we've come up with two new
ones since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all kinds of data that you can
use at a place like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is using the almost latest and
greatest version of the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not quite, and comparing to OBS on the
top from the Harmonized World Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just soil carbon stocks from
the surface down to a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw a lot of darts at the
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a ton of observational
uncertainty when you try to look at global
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon stocks, especially down to a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several different groups have had several
different maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one recent estimate puts the number
twice of what that top plot shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a huge amount of observational
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This version of CLM is pretty nifty in the
sense it has vertically resolved carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's got vertically resolved
representation of soil carbon pools,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows you to develop permafrost
carbon at high latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see so much red at high
latitudes in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then MIMIX is just using a single
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just extrapolating these ideas from
the surface all the way down to a meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a huge simplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's numerically a lot faster to solve
if you don't have to think about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil layers down to a meter depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd say that both of these models
kind of look reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have global soil carbon stocks that
roughly match the observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also add that both of these
models are better than the Star Wars,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sorem troopers throwing darts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the CMIP5 models are worse than
both of these up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've learned something in the last few
years since the CMIP models came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can look at how they respond
to different perturbations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took the steady state pools that
were spun up using identical forcing so
[SPEAKER_00]: the same climate, same NPP inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at how they respond here to
elevated CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you juice a model with CO2,
models like the community land model or
[SPEAKER_00]: really any Earth system model that have
kind of bulb area and far core
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis in them respond by
increasing plant productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you increase plant productivity,
you increase litter fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these models have the same
response, but from these initial pools,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they respond in future years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going from present day out to
2100 with only the elevated CO2 response
[SPEAKER_00]: in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not looking at temperature
sensitivity here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that CLM, which is the
community land model and mimics the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial model that I've been working
with, show really divergent trajectories
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the amount of carbon you can
store on land under elevated CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this matters in the sense that if we're
trying to make policy recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: about how much carbon we can put in the
atmosphere to reach COP21 or to reach RCP
[SPEAKER_00]: 8.5, to reach some target, we need to know
how much carbon the land can store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these models are telling you is
that you can get a factor two,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get twice as much carbon depending on
which model you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make policy recommendations
that might be realistic if we think that
[SPEAKER_00]: the land surface is going to continue
acting as a carbon sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's even more interesting to me is then
the spatial distribution of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens in the model is that
tropical NPP, tropical productivity really
[SPEAKER_00]: blows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that in the CLM results
where the carbon stocks are proportional
[SPEAKER_00]: to NPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any place that NPP increases,
that's where you end up storing carbon in
[SPEAKER_00]: the model like CLM.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a model like mimics, you can actually
lose carbon at high latitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's because of priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this isn't a thermal response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an elevated CO2 response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a microbial explicit model,
when you feed microbes more carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbial biomass pool gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger that microbial biomass pool is,
it can churn through more soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in places like high latitudes,
you actually lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger microbial biomass pools at low
latitudes here are actually stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: because of assumptions that the model
makes about how finely textured soils
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this really divergent spatial
pattern between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the assumptions that you make
in the model and the assumptions that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make about how different parts of the
model respond to perturbations really
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in terms of how these trajectories
play out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm absolutely not arguing that these
results are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because this is a microbial explicit
model, I want to start to think about ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can use some of these fine scale
data to refine our kind of projections and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the confidence ultimately at
global scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is no small challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sequence the genomes and the
metagenomes and do proteomics and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other crazy cool stuff that you guys have
learned to do to soils, you get just a
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And figuring out how to take that wealth
of data and distill it down into something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is simple enough for me and my model
to understand is really, really tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the challenge that I'd like to
make is that in some ways, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: this omics revolution is still,
in some ways, still in the 17th or 18th
[SPEAKER_00]: century and really just cataloging and
counting organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still are, at least in my
understanding, is we're still kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking some of the function in this,
especially broad scale functioning related
[SPEAKER_00]: to carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the challenge then is moving from
these kind of super detailed bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: diagrams of what microbes are in the soil
to what they're actually doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially thinking about that in a
functional sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be more complicated than this
two microbes situation that I've drawn up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's part of the trick of
what Dan and Johannes and our groups are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a few of these slides are blatantly
plagiarized from work that Dan and his
[SPEAKER_00]: group have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try not to butcher the
science too much as I talk about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what SIP technology and Dan's group
were able to do is to take an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental sample here, soils from a
local ag field, and labelize that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with 13C so that instead of looking at the
entire microbial community that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, you're only looking at the microbes
that are active, the microbes that took up
[SPEAKER_00]: this label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this sample, there's all these
other microbes that are in the soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not active.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't take up the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using SIP, you can label microbes and
you're only labeling the active part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you centrifuge the sample down to
separate the DNA and you're able to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at just the 13C DNA and see who's there
and potentially what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of forget about the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to worry about the rest of
the non-active part of the community as
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's some huge challenges in
going from the stuff that's published in
[SPEAKER_00]: FEMS and the journals like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how PCA axes map onto this
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the tricks, I think,
is figuring out how to have this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interdisciplinary dialogue and thinking
about ways that blips on this screen can
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into blips on this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are some kind of preliminary
results from Dan's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a PCA going through one of
these experiments, one of these SIP
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments where they added a whole
cocktail of 13C labeled substrates to
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and then looking at the variation in
who was active at what times and for how
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically looking at the identity of
who was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's explained by the first axis of
this PCA is basically an oligotrophic to
[SPEAKER_00]: copiotrophic ratio in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you have on the right side are
organisms that group functionally and they
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be relatively fast growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have high copy number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're utilizing relatively soluble
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're relatively low diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, on the left side of the PCA,
these are slower growing organisms with
[SPEAKER_00]: low copy number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're utilizing relatively insoluble
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really highly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a whole bunch of organisms that
are on this kind of slow growing side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about a model,
this is, at least for me, I was super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited that Dan was like, your model
seems to make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not totally, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a seminar to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not this one, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally lost my strength for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's support for this kind of
copiotrophic to oligotrophic or this fast
[SPEAKER_00]: or slow dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I think that would
be really interesting with these data,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dan and I were staring at all these
little curves on his screen yesterday,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is kind of a growth response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, where you can look at abundance
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the slope of these fast
growing organisms and the slope of these
[SPEAKER_00]: slow growing organisms and start to inform
some of the kinetics that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's temperature sensitive VMAX and
KM parameters that go into a model like
[SPEAKER_00]: MIMIX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've just kind of made some
assumptions up that give you fast and slow
[SPEAKER_00]: turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my hope is that we can actually
constrain what's really an infinite amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of these results in the sense
that you can estimate growth rate curves
[SPEAKER_00]: from these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one example where hopefully SIP
data can really be directly translated
[SPEAKER_00]: into a model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also note, none of Dan's
curves look nearly as nice as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me idealizing the data that he's
going to be producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's also some evidence from
these results that substrate quality
[SPEAKER_00]: really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these fast growing organisms are
the ones that are eating relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the slow growing ones are eating
relatively insoluble substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's slightly different than this kind
of metabolic and structural litter idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in MIMIX.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still this idea that there are
differences in microbial, in the food that
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those differences really matter in
terms of how they map on to who's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it, who has access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, and this is I think where
you'll see Johannes and his group come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that after the microbes access the
food, then they die and either get eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: by other microbes, or they stick to
mineral surfaces, or they form aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And figuring out the fate of these
microbial residues is really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's absolutely just made up in the
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely no data that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of carbon that goes into this
physiochemically protected pool is
[SPEAKER_00]: determined by clay content, which kind of
makes sense, but not really if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount that's available is kind of
just parameterized so that it's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: big and not too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flux rates around that really
could use some information, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: where these turnover products go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these fast turnover microbes,
are they covered with sticky residues that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually adhere to mineral surfaces?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what confers physicochemical
stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it because these slow microbes are
actually growing on mineral surfaces to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with, and potentially exuding these
extracellular saccharides that are then
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking to other soil particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's forming aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have any idea about how this
faster slow dichotomy plays out in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ultimate stabilization of soil
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really critical moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some assumptions in the model,
and I look at those as tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here's a hypothesis, and you can come
up with a model with a different model
[SPEAKER_00]: structure or different parameters in the
model that are an alternative hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the trick is figuring out the
experiments that can really isolate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's some really incredible
opportunities for this knowledge data
[SPEAKER_00]: integration or knowledge and model
integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this is kind of a
theoretical framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess one of the things I like to think
about is using models like this as the
[SPEAKER_00]: best test of our knowledge in terms of how
we think a system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's obviously a gross simplification
but does this provide kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical framework that we can
understand some of the SIPP data,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can understand other microbial
omics data, and then we can think about
[SPEAKER_00]: other visualization techniques to see
where those microbial residues end up and
[SPEAKER_00]: what confers stabilization over long
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to kind of wrap up by talking
a little bit about how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we handle nutrient limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is at large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I was kind of
consistently struck by, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from a more ecological university
framework than moving up to NCAR is that
[SPEAKER_00]: really the science in some ways is 10 to
20 years behind the stuff that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: all are thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the tricks is figuring
out how we can transfer knowledge from
[SPEAKER_00]: universities up to places like NCAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really start a dialogue so that it's a
two-way street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so nutrient limitation is an awesome
way to do that because we're so far
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so until it's illegal, we're going to
keep dumping CO2 in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing that really just juices the
terrestrial carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real question is, how long can we
do that for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much carbon can the land surface
take up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge amount of uncertainty in
models about kind of the ecosystem service
[SPEAKER_00]: that the land surface provides in terms of
how much additional atmospheric carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide we can absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the cement models going
all the way from 1850 through 2100,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the change in net primary
productivity that they show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a six-fold range in terms of how
much NPP will increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start off at different places to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't all start off at the same
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a six-fold range in terms of the
amount of how much NPP will increase by
[SPEAKER_00]: 2100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much will the land surface
soak up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is under RCP 8.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the business as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to get really hot and
lots of CO2 in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's basically a three-fold range
in terms of how much carbon the land
[SPEAKER_00]: surface will absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a huge amount of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are all models that use
basically the same photosynthesis routine
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically the same kind of soil carbon
representations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So effectively, these are all elvises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have this huge amount of
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question that I have is,
is this amount of terrestrial carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake overblown?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's really critical to know if
we need to know the allowable emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to get us to certain
desirable targets, we need to know how
[SPEAKER_00]: much the land surface can soak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know from agriculture and from the
$1 billion fertilizer industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like nitrogen and phosphorus and
potassium are really, really critical in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling aspects of the carbon cycle,
at least in agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know in the ocean that nutrients
really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parts of the ocean tend to be
nitrogen-limited or silica-limited or
[SPEAKER_00]: iron-limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, nutrient limitation really
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even people like Redfield in the
ocean came up with these ratios of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable ways that biomass is a
significant source of nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even on land, we can start to take
away, we can start to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions about how much nitrogen,
how much phosphorus you need to fix a unit
[SPEAKER_00]: of carbon or to take it out of the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that new productivity of plants
are going to grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need more phosphorus
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the study, we made some really
gross simplifications and fixed those
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios about if you build leaves or if you
build wood or if you build grass or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: build roots, how much carbon and nitrogen
phosphorus you need for all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: different tissues to be built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kind of took this idea of
Liebig's law of the minimum, that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have enough nitrogen or you don't
have enough phosphorus, that limits the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of carbon that you could actually
take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took this map of nitrogen fixation
and nitrogen deposition and rolled it out
[SPEAKER_00]: through 2100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing for phosphorus weathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually came from Natalie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the amount of phosphorus weathering
and the amount of new phosphorus that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could expect to come into ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took a map of plant biomass,
so where plants are growing now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and assumed that that distribution
wouldn't change through 2100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a huge amount of assumptions and kind
of held all those assumptions constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we wanted to look at how changes
in NPP and changes in the land carbon sink
[SPEAKER_00]: could evolve over time if we assumed that
plants had a limited supply of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: and phosphorus to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's shown in red is the potential
nitrogen effect and what's shown in purple
[SPEAKER_00]: is the combined nitrogen and phosphorus
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not surprisingly, if we assume that
to build this new tissue, you need new
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and new phosphorus to go with it,
we decrease the kind of acceleration of
[SPEAKER_00]: NPP throughout the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of interestingly, the period that we
have observations, it's pretty impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: to distinguish between those three lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, once you in the next 80 years,
it's really going to play out that you end
[SPEAKER_00]: up with different trajectories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the same set of models and
just kind of a fancy back of the envelope
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation about how changes in NPP might
take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we map that on to how changes in
land uptake would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, what's really disturbing is
we've gone, even though NPP is increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of the 21st century,
you end up having the land is no longer a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon sink, it's a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this loss of carbon from
terrestrial ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That based on this map should be happening
now-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of ecosystem benefits,
this analysis suggests that without
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about nitrogen cycling and
without thinking about phosphorus cycling,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the amount of kind of ecosystem
benefit we can expect by pumping more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more CO2 into the atmosphere will kind of
be diminishing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also a huge opportunity then
for model knowledge integration,
[SPEAKER_00]: the assumptions that went into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study are grossly oversimplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that there's a lot more
complexity to these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the CMIP-5 suite of models,
there was only two that had a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all those land models, they both
used a version of the community land
[SPEAKER_00]: model, which is the land component of the
NCAR system model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 11 models in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them use nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually use the same land model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just an N of 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have one Elvis that we can
compare to, which is really frightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known for hundreds of years that
nitrogen matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't been able to put it in
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's obviously a lot of
opportunities for progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been a big focus of what
we've been doing at NCAR for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: several years is improving both the carbon
and nitrogen cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more recently, we've really been
focused a lot on aspects of the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now, instead of three Elvises,
we get three bikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the community land model is,
again, the terrestrial component of the
[SPEAKER_00]: community earth system model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's run at NCAR and built on by a
host of DOE and university collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in this latest version of CLM,
there's something like 50 different
[SPEAKER_00]: partner institutions that contributed to
the development of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think of it as the Firefox of the
earth system models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can put their science in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of suss out what's good and
what's bad and what needs to stay and what
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first version of the community
land model that had nitrogen in it was
[SPEAKER_00]: called CLM4.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple years ago, we released a newer
version of the model that had that
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically resolved soil carbon and a
whole lot of improvements to terrestrial
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CLM4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within CLM5 is a whole ton of
extra science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, what I'm going to just focus
on now is some of the changes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone on with the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of functionality in
terms of how we think about crops and land
[SPEAKER_00]: management and having a whole lot of
functionality that should open doors for
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of more science to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this offers, then,
is a window into what, in the modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: world, we call structural uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, that's kind of,
as modelers, we don't know how the real
[SPEAKER_00]: world works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you come up with different models,
different bicycles, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: different Elvis's, different Madonna's,
and figure out how to best represent those
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a really nice example where
we have models that are actually from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll force them in these experiments
with the same historical climate
[SPEAKER_00]: reanalysis, which is called the GSWP3,
stands for the global soil water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gives you a snapshot of
what climate looked like over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spin up happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a 20th century transient
run, much like what I showed you before,
[SPEAKER_00]: with transient land use and active crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a control simulation and then
a plus nitrogen simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was kind of my attempt to think
about, well, as an ecologist, if I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn how my system was nutrient
limited, a good way to test that is with
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrient addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this addition, we added 5 grams
of nitrogen per meter squared,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 50 kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of like agricultural levels of
fertilizer application, but applied
[SPEAKER_00]: globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike doing this in the real world,
this finished in a day, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do global runs with three
different models and get them done in a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have so much data,
you don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a result just looking at the
differences in the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the structural uncertainty just
of the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of something like GPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is terrestrial gross primary
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in these simulations,
I'm just showing 1955 through 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's a pretty big
variation in terms of what GPP is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the slope of those lines is pretty
similar, which kind of tells you that the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 fertilization effect is fairly similar
in all of these models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a little bit steeper in the
red line, which is CLM5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all roughly within ballpark in
terms of what we think terrestrial GPP
[SPEAKER_00]: should be kind of present day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at a map of then of what these
GPP estimates look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see that you go from
really bright yellow colors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics in CLM4 to then kind of higher
productivity at high latitudes in CLM5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more so, much more reasonable
representation to productivity both at
[SPEAKER_00]: high and low latitudes in CLM5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a few metrics for how the
carbon cycle and water cycle and energy
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle works at global scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is for GPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a product called ILAM that Jim
Randerson at UCI and others at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: DOE labs are working on that lets you test
models like this and score them and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of give them a skill score about how well
they represent the water cycle and the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so fortunately, even though we've
crammed all of this science, into CLM5,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's doing a better job than previous
versions of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to lose our jobs yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we seem to be doing a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can look at the change with
nitrogen fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the change with nitrogen
fertilization, which happened in 1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CLM4 really blows up in terms of how
much productivity increases with nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: CLM45 not quite as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response is even more muted with
CLM5, which is interesting when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about how nitrogen limited is your model.
[SPEAKER_00]: CLM5 is much less nitrogen limited than
predecessors of the model, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of its GPP response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does it happen globally?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map that differences the
fertilized response from the unfertilized
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see in CLM4, it's really
globally, but especially strong in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics, which is probably unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we think we know about tropical
forests is there might be some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that are nitrogen limited, but they're not
that nitrogen limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the things that we
changed in moving to CLM5, is we reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen limitation in tropical
forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the core of the
Amazon is no longer nitrogen limited in
[SPEAKER_00]: these runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then interestingly, we've largely
gotten rid of nitrogen limitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in terms of GPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally here, with the exception of C4,
we've gotten rid of nitrogen limitation in
[SPEAKER_00]: grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tropical savannas are still really,
really strongly nitrogen limited in this
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not saying that any of these,
this one is almost certainly unrealistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I couldn't say for sure whether one of
these nitrogen responses looks better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a huge shift,
but now we're going to look at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: set of plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of looking at GPP, look at NPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think here, the responses are a
little bit more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas we saw this real big difference
in terms of the GPP response, the NPP
[SPEAKER_00]: response, which in some ways is more
important, that's the carbon that's left
[SPEAKER_00]: over after plants respire it, is more
similar between CLM4.5 and CLM5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, in the tropics, you see this
huge NPP response in CLM4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what's happening here is these
trees are just turning into giant baobab
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their LAI is already, their leaf area
index is already, they have too many
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you give them more carbon,
they can't build more leaves, and so all
[SPEAKER_00]: they do is get really fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are really woody, really just
chunky trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's sort of a similar response,
but it's again more of a poleward shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get stem densities at high
latitudes that are probably in boreal
[SPEAKER_00]: forests that are probably unrealistic in
CLM4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response in CLM5 I think is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see temperate forests kind of
responding in ways that may or may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the things that Christy
and some others of us are trying to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about is which, do we have enough data to
suss out whether one of these responses is
[SPEAKER_00]: more realistic than the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not necessarily to,
my goal isn't necessarily to say which
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the model is right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's to kind of, it's to start to
understand like do we have now that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: representing at least fluxes in ways that
may be realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of global responses, these in
terms of the percent changes are both
[SPEAKER_00]: within kind of meta-analysis ranges of
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we seem to be doing an OK response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we have enough data to suss out
whether one is more likely or the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really have a sense for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then lastly, these are the changes in
total vegetation carbon storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, because CLM4 builds big woody,
chunky trees, it packs on too much carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and has a probably unrealistic vegetation
carbon response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's most muted in CLM5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of you are interested,
I can talk for a long time about why that
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, so now we've got all these
different bikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which one is better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And which one should we get rid of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And which one should we keep?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a whole lot of
opportunities that we can start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about ways that what are the data products
that we need to constrain things like the
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of nutrient limitation in a
model like CLM?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can that inform kind of the next,
what are the next model development steps
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to take moving forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it wasn't that long ago when the
idea of explicitly considering microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in large CL models seems totally
unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one of the things that I've
shown and that others have shown is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not only feasible, but it's also
probably important to start considering in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that a lot of these models are
actually, they give you better confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: and they tend to reduce uncertainties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not reduce uncertainties,
but they improve confidence moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, consideration of microbial
diversity in biogeochemical models seems
[SPEAKER_00]: really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems kind of far-fetched, not that
long ago, but hopefully I've convinced you
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's at least achievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not it should be done is,
I think, open for debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it opens doors for new
collaborations and new interactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: can hopefully both accelerate,
that can hopefully accelerate developments
[SPEAKER_00]: in both modeling and empirical fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, I think it's also
important to consider the broader
[SPEAKER_00]: implications of some of the work that you
guys do and hopefully open some doors for
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to think about applying the science
in large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Models like CLM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll open it up for
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering if you can say a little
bit more about pools and fluxes in your
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon model compared to sort of a fast,
slow, and non-reactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, you've got two pools of
carbon and you've got fluxes between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think the bigger difference is
on this side of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surprising that the LiDET results
look good, because we're basically only
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating the left side of the model with
that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the partitioning that I use
between structural and metabolic carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's identical to what's in Dacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's no different at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dacent uses three litter pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only using two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very similar in the sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different is that in a model like
Dacent, these have predefined turnover
[SPEAKER_00]: times, which is the k value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the decay rate that are modified by
environmental scalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that uses just a first order linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a first order linear model.
[SPEAKER_00]: What MIMICS uses is a reverse
Michaelis-Mitten model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both the size of the microbial
biomass pool and the size of the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: pool matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the math, it's not just the
size of this pool that determines its flux
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the size of both of these pools that
determines the transfer rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's different on the kinetic
side of the litter decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different over here is that whereas
you could kind of make the analogy that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a fast pool and this is a slow
pool and this is an inert pool or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically just, I guess,
how it's wired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microbial residues can go right into
this inert pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what changes in that inert pool
doesn't decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it basically, I think of it as
desorbing or aggregates breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some environmental factor that
controls how quickly this turns over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not under microbial control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually behaves much like a first
order model, except that it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any CO2 fluxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pool has to depolymerize,
which is under microbial control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a larger microbial biomass,
you'll both lose more carbon here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll also lose it out of these two
pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the difference is these
feedbacks between the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial biomass pool affects the rest of
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a first order model,
it's just the size of the pool itself that
[SPEAKER_00]: matters, the donor pool in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see how this model would have a
future where you get rid of the left side,
[SPEAKER_04]: the substrate quality, and handle
everything in terms of accessibility?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you mean like just have this stuff so
that litter inputs go directly into here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think especially when you think
about vertically resolving it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the litter inputs at depth in soils
aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inputs at depth are likely trickling
down from above somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily plant residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't thought about the math very much
to know how that would mess things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the things that a model like
this needs is to be vertically resolved to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fit into a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A CLM type structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at depth, you would assume that this
would be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, on the surface, you would
assume that none of this would really
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just have that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the model is totally naive to the
idea of stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sense that some external factor
would affect below ground processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is exactly why I'm interested in
building models like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you can ask that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of data you would
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how some sort of input on this side
affects something over here is interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that, to me,
the part of this that's fascinating is to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about how either a sandy soil or a
clay soil or a high iron and aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: oxide soil versus a one-to-one clay would
look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's no concept of
aggregates explicitly in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could think about explicit
aggregate formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't thought about that, especially
at large scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at smaller scales,
it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't talk much about temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know in terms of enzyme kinetics,
they're usually pretty predictable
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships between temperature and
activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for an organism, it's not always
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the optimum temperature is often really
close to the maximum temperature,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least for a microbe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why you get a fever when you're
sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you increase your temperature
at 1 degree Celsius, then it can really
[SPEAKER_03]: kill off the organism or slow its growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wonder if any of these models
consider the organismal rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: enzymatic effect of temperature and
whether or not there are temperature
[SPEAKER_03]: thresholds on particular activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an easy answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about it in some terms,
in the plant response, so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature acclimation term in the
photosynthetic part of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could think about doing an acclimation
type term or a threshold type response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll change your answers, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about that more in terms of
latitudinal gradients, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature response that you might get in
a high latitude soil could be steeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could imagine you might have a
stronger temperature response going from 0
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees to 1 degree C than you get from
going from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of carbon up there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the temperature response function that
we have has that kind of response that is
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger at low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't think about acclimation or
how microbes have the agency, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eating carbon right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was actually a big, I think,
motivation for thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use a century type model,
the best way to store carbon in soils is
[SPEAKER_00]: this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you stick in high lignin, slow to
decompose stuff that turns over at a slow
[SPEAKER_00]: rate and goes into this kind of chemically
inert pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the theory behind mimics,
at least right now, is that the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to store carbon, at least in finely
textured soils, is to add this labile
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that builds microbial biomass more
quickly, that turns over relatively fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these long turnover pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works now in clayey soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the model's parameterized is
that in clayey soils, this top route is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to stabilize carbon in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in sandy soils, this bottom route is
still the best way to store carbon in
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a different prediction that you
get from a model with this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's right, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of what should people in New
York do, that's a question that matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we throw fertilizer over our
forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask Christy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to lime the forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
