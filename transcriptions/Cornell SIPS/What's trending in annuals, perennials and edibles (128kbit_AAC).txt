[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love sharing what I know with all
of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we've got growers in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got graduate students in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got garden centers in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pleased to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you don't recognize me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got heck last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff told me, where's my hat?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I have way too little time to
tell way too many stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is that this hat is a whole
lot more important than I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I gave you a handout, which was kind
of fun to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, about 50% of it you won't even
see today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'd be a good handout for you anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am going to talk a little bit about
veggies as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because unlike Peter, I haven't quite
gotten all the way there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trialing veggies at the
University of Georgia for all the new,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I call patio vegetables, ornamental
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter, who is going to get
vegetables and doesn't want to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbors, who want vegetables but
don't want to make a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been doing this for some time
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, here's what I'm going
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, we talk forever about how we're
going to get young people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at young people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only under 50 as a young person,
into this sort of this game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody, and I mean everybody,
is using a cell phone, a smartphone,
[SPEAKER_02]: to do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: My son, who's way too old, living in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he doesn't move a muscle without
doing this little thing, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: Uber or a restaurant or a review.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why don't we do something about
what we do on the smartphone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look to try and find
information on the web, you can find a ton
[SPEAKER_02]: of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to be sitting on the web.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you go to your phone, go to the
web, and there's a ton of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: a ton of different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we find a place that works?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have developed this for what it's
worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it works, we will see if this thing
actually happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't happen, I've really
given you a great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a cell phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the right, you can see an app called
Armitage.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I have developed an app for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: For gardeners, landscapers, garden
centers, anybody who touches plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is an app that I developed for my
neighbors and my daughters.
[SPEAKER_02]: People not like you who know something,
but people who want to know something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't want it so complicated they
can't figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do this, and this is totally up
to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about 10,000 on this thing right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do this, you just go to your,
and this is right now, and I really
[SPEAKER_02]: hesitate to say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the new version, which you're
looking at, is on the iPhone and iPad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be on the Android, hopefully by
next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have an Android and you want to
do it, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait for a week or so because the new
version is much better than the old one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having said that, if you want to go to
your app store, search Armitage,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this will come right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Dr. A's Greatest Perennials
and Annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to demonstrate this for
about five minutes, and then we'll get
[SPEAKER_02]: into the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you hit this thing, it comes up
here, and then it comes up to this screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is your iPhone screen,
or your iPad, which is really spectacular
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says everything up there, and there's
all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of things, but let me go to
the ton of things that you're interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every single plant that you sell,
and I'm saying you sell, you breed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you work with, is on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So andrials and perennials and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Angelonia, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hit this, it comes up, and it's
real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a common name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single plant has a deer browsing
rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, if you hit this,
it says three, and it comes up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it says one, two, three, four,
or five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a hosta, or is it something that
they're not going to really touch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now deer will eat anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having done all the research,
it's the best I can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on here, there's a rabbit browsing,
the same thing, heights, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it says why it makes my
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry gang, it's my app.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I either like it or don't like it,
and I tell you why, I think it's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, actually a few
people actually think I know what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hints for success, for my neighbor,
for your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it sun, is it shade, what's it need,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the neat thing is my topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the varieties of the
cultivars that you're probably selling
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having said all that, people like
pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can do this picture right here,
I can then do this picture, and it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's about 12 different pictures of
Angeloni on here, which I can see is not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we'll go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if I do it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, all these little dots up there,
each one is a different photograph.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them are the ones that I am
recommending.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have photos, you have information,
you have something that's really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me show you something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any plant is in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could have fun with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's videos on here where I'm yapping
about something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of goodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me show you a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go over here, this says plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do annuals or perennials or
natives or grasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go all the way down to a USDA zone
you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I also go over here, I hit garden
centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know the Sugar Mark Adams are here
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that I wrote a bunch of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any garden center people in the
audience, and if I wrote you and you
[SPEAKER_02]: ignored me, so be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get listed on this app free of
charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are people in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about 200 miles in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's Adams.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Newburgh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Poughkeepsie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're in Wappington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wabinger, Wabinger, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so if I hit this thing,
what happens in any garden center,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you know a good garden center,
and these are good garden centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to the internet and grabbing
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing them based on recommendations
or they write me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, OK, here's Adams Farakers in
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that Sue sent me or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phone number, you can call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The global thing, that's their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't hit it because it's just real slow
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing up here, and again,
I'll hit it, but I don't want it to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Google Maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Google Maps will take you right there,
wherever you're standing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any garden center in the country who
wants to get on here gets listed free of
[SPEAKER_02]: charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it costs them is to tell their
people that they're on the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're on the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why wouldn't they tell them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, and the last thing I'm going to
show you is things that I believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's birds and butterflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody who's in a sustainable thing,
you'd like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of good books I like,
ground covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with HGTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some thoughts on plant food.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a recommendation from my daughters
and others with too little time and too
[SPEAKER_02]: little money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody fertilizes plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about it, but they don't fertilize
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found something, and I work with a
really cool company that's out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this cool company is called Nature
Source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, so if it says a plant food,
it says how to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows what stores are doing it right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing, and again,
and I unfortunately probably Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is done at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is done in the greenhouses yesterday
with Nature Source versus not Nature
[SPEAKER_02]: Source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just showing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I believe in something,
I like to tell the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's one on the right with Nature
Source, one on the left with something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole slew of these things
that we can show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, so this is what this app
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is for, and I tell you who's really
using it, are the staff of garden centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go behind a pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come out, yes, sir, how can I
help you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I wanted to show you that,
because that is truly a trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is one trend in this world,
it is a smartphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trend that we have never even
taken advantage of at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Horticulture Magazine has their
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we probably all have a little thing
here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do your neighbor have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would buy all my books and
haul them around, but they're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my daughter, for sure, will buy one of
my books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing is, that's what this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want, if you're interested,
have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a garden center, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll certainly put you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody needs a card and stuff,
we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to show it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to get into something
else, assuming we can make this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a handout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'll never get through all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't even worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do the best we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already taken a bunch of stuff off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm looking at Mark and Sue
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know they're going to carry much of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with so many different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with a place called the Perennial
Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with the nature source people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Al Newsom is here with his Good Dirt,
which is going to be a great product for
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys coming down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with HGTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any questions and all that
stuff, I certainly work with the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: flower people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait to hear what Chris has to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I've often been speaking
with Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really good to speak with
Marjorie, because I know I have pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Marjorie comes in, and boy,
my stuff looks awful after she's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's done with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, how can we keep up with this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, digiplexus.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is digiplexus?
[SPEAKER_02]: And lamprocapnos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody know what lamprocapnos is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dicentra.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you're going to be seeing Dicentra
spectabilis, the great big beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: bleeding heart, is now this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is, it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, is this thing working?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are we really serious?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, truly, is there such a thing as a
ketchup and fries plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we really gone that far down the road?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this is plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talk about plants a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about marketing a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about anything you want me to
talk about, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is in front of stores in a little
town in Canada called Niagara-on-the-Lake.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get to Niagara-on-the-Lake,
you'll understand why plants make a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: This town and many other towns I know – I
mean, Cooper's town is fabulous,
[SPEAKER_02]: too – they plant plants because they know
in front of stores that people are more
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable when there's plants around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll spend more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a simple thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can do – you know, we can beautify
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have programs to certainly help towns
and all – do beautification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just plant some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a grower, give plants away
to stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help them do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as much work as it is to sell
plants, and customers simply want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care how serious you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their customer is not serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're serious about spending money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do it for therapy, and they do it
for the beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have that same kind of like,
ugh, this guy's – in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I mean, you've got these
master gardeners that will knock your head
[SPEAKER_02]: off absolutely without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is, people buy plants for
therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes them feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite truthfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep them happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take yourself seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to take yourself seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would just have no friends whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is who we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get ourselves started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take me seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to tell you a bunch of stuff
because I think this is – you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my hundred years in practice here has
shown me what I think are great plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: what people want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to walk away from here
hopefully with two plants out of all
[SPEAKER_02]: these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says American horticulture and
gardening have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But gang, just in case you're wondering,
let's not get ourselves too carried away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was cool because there were three
New Guinean patients this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and next year we are hoping for six.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could double the number of plants
that a person buys, we would be in pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good shape, wouldn't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wait until you see what Kendra and
group have done this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really neat, the plants that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to start with these
off-maligned creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start today with annuals.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And annuals really are maligned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so many plant snobs out
there and they certainly wouldn't buy
[SPEAKER_02]: annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, those of you who are in the garden
center business and in the petunia trade
[SPEAKER_02]: and the calibrachoa trade, we know how
important these are for landscapers and
[SPEAKER_02]: how important they are for those people
who want to beautify properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, annuals?
[SPEAKER_02]: A geranium?
[SPEAKER_02]: A marigold?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is so fabulous what has gone on out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the breeding has been nothing short of
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see some of that this
afternoon as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to start taking you
through a very little tour of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that I think are terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I don't have a lot of time,
so if I do speed up, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in North Country now, so you can raise
your hand and I can say, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know something, shoot the
puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me know, all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot the puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't do that in Georgia real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being an old Canuck, that's all we used to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're ready because it is time to
start the engines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where your handout starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you see anything you want to take a
look at, please feel free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angelonia, and again, I've really culled
this list down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I do talks on annuals at last
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But angelonia, called angel flower,
called summer snapdragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant that tolerates, you know,
you've had a nice, relatively cool summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of rain here, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the anjoins look pretty good at
the trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a summer where it's warmer and
you get a summer where it's drier,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a fabulous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I think, and I've told all my
students and I think all of you
[SPEAKER_02]: understand, even though my daughter will
come in and she won't have a clue what a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar is, it's a cultivar world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the species of this
looks like anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we live in a cultivar world,
so you should know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets really, are there any
retailers here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you guys are where the rubber hits
the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must understand this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That when your neighbor comes in to your
store and looks for something,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not going to ask for corrida
angelonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you realize, or you know because
you've walked around, you've looked
[SPEAKER_02]: around, you've studied, you may even
believe me, that this is a good series,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you sell them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not coming into your store
because they don't like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming into your store because
they trust you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't have to sell a cultivar
name, but you have to sell them a good
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nobody comes into your store
today, nobody, and says, hey Mark,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's old?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody says that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in, they say, what's new?
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, oh no, what's new?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's new to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter's going to see for five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's new really means, what have you
got that's good?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyway, so enough of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that I think is terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another series out there,
the serenitas, which are a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole short and compact thing we
really kind of like as an industry because
[SPEAKER_02]: we can ship them easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to maintain quite as much in
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're generally better breaking,
and they're just as easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is pink, and there's other colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, archangel, dark rose, these are all
on your handout, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, you know, we need different
colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked a few from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that is really
happening today, the garden of today,
[SPEAKER_02]: and certainly the garden of tomorrow,
without a doubt, is the deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means containers, baskets,
and what you see from the deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to say there's going to be no
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: But containers and baskets are becoming
more important, not just because,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, they're kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else are we going to do with a
bacopa?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what else are you going to throw
in a container?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nobody else would have it
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is, you know, a lot of these
plants have been bred to fall out of
[SPEAKER_02]: baskets, to fall out of containers,
and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these spreading ones, I think,
are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even spreading roses, you might
know, that actually are designed for
[SPEAKER_02]: baskets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a trend, to be sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, somebody asked me once,
how big is that deck going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty simple, as large as the Wi-Fi
signal reaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, begonias, you know,
again, that's sort of a begonia,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like, oh my god, a begonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is, wax begonias are almost
indestructible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and when you're working with
people that really don't, and I say this,
[SPEAKER_02]: any landscapers here, well, okay,
a few of you, I won't say anything
[SPEAKER_02]: terribly bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, landscapers are a great
group, and they really do enhance
[SPEAKER_02]: properties and all, but a lot of them
really don't know a whole lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you do is you make sure they
have plants that they're going to succeed
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And begonias are just a great success
plant, certainly the wax begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the big series right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been really working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Banari product out of Germany,
and it looks really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big plant, and gardeners love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Landscapers can fill in a lot of room with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dragon wings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, good grief, if it wasn't for
dragon wings, we wouldn't have begonias
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they're old, to be sure, but they're
still a fabulous seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here it is with Artemisia in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know they work in the baskets,
and we know they work just about anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, on the app under begonias,
I made a special thing for dragon wings
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what else is happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is what's happening,
and you'll see some in the garden this
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon, the pendulous kind of Bolivian
types, but don't even worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pendulous forms of begonias,
and there's Santa Cruz, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: mention cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should know a little bit about
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as a consumer, you don't care,
but as certainly a person in the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: world, you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Cruz is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've trialed everyone known to man,
and I think probably Kendra is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: trialing a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, another Banari product by you
can see how pendulous these things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is grown in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put this in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to look as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still going to look pretty darn fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly in Ithaca, New York,
this is going to look terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the newest one, if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see this other new group
that I think is just fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: This just comes out of a place called
Vegitalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, this is bossa nova series.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the Santa Cruz and San
Francisco group, and then the bossa nova
[SPEAKER_02]: group that I think are terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's lots of others, but there's
some that you can take a look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe try one or two of these if you like
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had but one plant to put in front of
my store, or one plant to put on the
[SPEAKER_02]: doorway going into the house, it would
probably be some of these new Rex hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because they're any better than the
others, but they just have that look that
[SPEAKER_02]: people just love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's Jurassic is a new group out of
well, it's out of Ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Shadow King is out of Greenfuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both breeders in this country,
and it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Jurassic one has gone crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've run out of plant material long
before they ran out of people who wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Shadow King is just finding its
mark right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are all shea plants,
four foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't flower worth a darn,
but boy, do they make a splash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give them something they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to spend the money,
give them something that they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be happy with parting with their dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in Cannes because this tropical look
is another trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a trend with us a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a fad and a trend five years,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: A fad lasts three years or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: A trend lasts five plus years and maybe
continues forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the trend has to stop being a trend
and being real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tropical look is real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's a taro or whether it's a
canna, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, every annual is a tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Impatience is tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a tropical look that many of us
are after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a Wasabi coleus at the
Botanical Garden in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a chance to get up there,
boy, is it a spectacular place to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, so there's a canna up pretty
far north.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have to be in a southern area.
[SPEAKER_02]: To grow these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Kendra's working with cannas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of fabulous cannas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The foliage on cannas can be really quite
exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the dark forms like
Australia, which has been out for a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we put Australia in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, most cannas today now are grown
from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a, well, as Marjorie
knows, big virus problems with cannas and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that are propagated vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you cannot get, as a grower,
you cannot get your material from seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be real careful about putting it out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the newest seed stuff are these two.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, the one on the top is Canova.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, another ball product,
a terrific product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a mix, that was at Georgia Trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: There came out this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this new one, Canisol from,
I want to say Syngenta, is coming out next
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a group, this one's called Clio,
but there's a whole group of them coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all bred to be short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I mean short meaning no higher than,
well, I'll say three feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, give or take, you're going
to be shorter here than we are in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are diseases, hardly any diseases to
speak of whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so two new groups from which to
choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I just threw this in because I
thought this was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a bird of paradise,
but it's actually a canna called bird of
[SPEAKER_02]: paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought I just stuck that outside the
window.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too weird to ignore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But speaking of a little weird,
you know, we need plants every now and
[SPEAKER_02]: then that people talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope that they're as good as the
hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need plants that people talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are talking about this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Digiplexus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now for those of you, and of course we're
here in the academic environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: of Cornell University, you know that this
is a very interesting intergeneric hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what they thought it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a cross between digitalis that we
know and a plant from the Canary Islands
[SPEAKER_02]: called isoplexus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they called digiplexus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now digiplexus is a common name only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanically it is now digitalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanically it is a digitalis hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is this digiplexus,
people kind of think this is neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is neat plant as long as the
retailers understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now certainly it should be pretty easy to
understand in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're selling this as an annual even
in Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, as a perennial even in Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Canary Islands are not exactly the
perennial capital of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so people are talking about it as
a fabulous annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will continue to flower if you cut back
the spent flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of breeding being done
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is illumination flame was the first
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's three or four new ones coming
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Berry, Canary and a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's got a three to five year
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get in it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think it's going to hang in
there for a long period of time even
[SPEAKER_02]: though they're going to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I don't know if Margie
looked at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some disease issues for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a digitalis as we think of a
digitalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it Digiplexis and you'll sell a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it and make it an annual and you will
do just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: People getting excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I can stand any more zonals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've zonal myself to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started the University of Georgia
trials in 1983, 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've trialed probably 100 different
geraniums almost every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always hired students.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best part of the whole
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hired students to take care of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deadhead zonals in August in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a tough student.
[SPEAKER_02]: All my students were very easily
employable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, they learned how to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, they're terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they're not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a zillion of them out there,
whether it's patriots or allures or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is, of course, what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening again, back to the basket
container thing, the hybrids between the
[SPEAKER_02]: zonals and the ivies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been happening in the last five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And calienti is one that I think most of
us can rely on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't know what timeless is,
it's a calienti with a new name.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company that put out timeless simply
bought that breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the ivies are just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real improvements in geranium are the
hybrids and the ivies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see a lot more of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also all sorts of scented
geraniums and colored geraniums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see some in the trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we saw some last night at
plantation, the variegated geraniums.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, for the landscaper,
for the person that really wants a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to last all summer and really
make a show, I think this is where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: at, my opinion only.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned last night that if I had did a
planting for a dormitory or a fraternity,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use lantanas and gomfrina.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the student fell out the window,
they would land on a lantana, and no
[SPEAKER_02]: damage would be done to either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lantanas are tough, but so are gomfrinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are what you put in the parking
lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you'll use in a median and a
roadway.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gomfrinas are just tough as nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you put canas and gomfrinas in
there, but look out, lantanas and
[SPEAKER_02]: gomfrinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Las Vegas are short.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the old gnome series.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, there's Las Vegas purple and
Las Vegas pink and Las Vegas white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is the one that I think is
really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a gardener on your clientele
or a landscaper, as opposed to somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: that just wants to throw color out there,
this is almost waist high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just the finest gomfrina
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not going to stick hundreds of
them out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a garden plant or a landscape
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, again, my take on gomfrina,
except for this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to know how many people have
tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we tried this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we done pink zazzle, anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, pink zazzle is now out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was out there last year in Little
Limited Things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been out there this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bid for, again, those garden centers or
growers or somebody want to try something
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weather tolerance is the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cornell here at Ithaca, New York may
be fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a little tough when it gets too
far south.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for you guys, it may be terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They either like it or hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't tell too many stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm from Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from way the heck up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Georgia now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they keep saying, the Canadians keep
saying, ah, you're so lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be so much fun to garden almost
year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do have winter, but it's still a
long gardening season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they complain that they can't grow
this and can't grow that because it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: cold for this, too cold for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at them like they're crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so much easier to garden in the
north than the south.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the north, it's either very
pretty or dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no middle ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the south, it sort of just languishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hangs in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to cut it because it's
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just spent a week in Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this may do very, very well for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And give it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is for Marjorie, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Marjorie's slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are for your book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is on the app, by the way,
Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So downy mildew is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a gazillion beddings.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume it's a problem here in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you're probably not selling much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably know not a whole lot of
people selling them or buying them or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the same picture that Marjorie
sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a huge problem in many areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you'll agree with me,
Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I see is the good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem to be getting a whole lot
worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still have lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there any help coming with this
thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the good news is that there is help
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're probably going to talk
about this a little bit about what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: James in here, graduate student James
Royo, he's working on the breeding to
[SPEAKER_02]: breed downy mildew out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hardly wait to see what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So watch this kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be a star.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is help coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what have we got today?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that the New Guineas aren't
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that we can throw New Guineas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But New Guineas aren't bedding impatience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't take shade as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, the sun patients and sun
harmony won't work in a shady area very
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do we need now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need Marjorie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need James.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need all the people involved in
this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because boy, oh boy, I don't have to tell
you what a huge problem this has become.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the number one ornamental seed
plant in the world.
Gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: In five years, gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the help is going to be from breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's absolutely no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make sprays and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a decent plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing you this not because I'm
selling bounce, but because I think this
[SPEAKER_02]: is as good as what we have at the moment
to replace those bedding impatience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of breaks on bounce, low growing,
lots of flowers, and shade tolerant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have better begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need better shade material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need lots of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have lots of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to try them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those beds where you want to have
a lot of color and you have partial shade,
[SPEAKER_02]: this might be one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I wish I was getting a penny
for everyone I sold, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time am I going to go to,
Bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more than 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Alissoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vast and frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start with Snow Princess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really ugly down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Knight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Snow Princess was the beginning of it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were an old codger like me,
you remember Sweet Alism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they just didn't last through the
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just didn't have the vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it certainly didn't get any heat on
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we have some terrific plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Stream series is
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Lavender Stream in a basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's Lavender Stream in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's White Stream over here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Yolo's come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just recently, it's a new one with a
really good white.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the lobularias or whatever this thing
is now are really quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to show you this because,
well, I showed you some pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really lovely stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really do have to understand there's
some dogs out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is ugly as sin, as far as I'm
concerned, but they're selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Tom-Tom or Totem or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I was with my friend and we were we
were disparaging this really ugly plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know that plants can't read.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided that yesterday that plants
can't read.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in areas that we shouldn't,
according to the books, most books that
[SPEAKER_02]: is, and they do just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we were saying these terrible
things, I'm not sure that plants can't
[SPEAKER_02]: hear because as we were walking away,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was saying it was number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always have fun with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, truly do not take any of this
stuff seriously, because this is why
[SPEAKER_02]: people love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, whether they can hear or
not, who knows, but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just finish off this annual thing
with a few terrific rubequias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the tiger eyes are extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver Daisy has been a real good one for
most of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big flower seems to do well,
and the prairie sun just won't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a good plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the annual rubequias are really quite
terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quite terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ornamental foliage ones, such as
Alternanthera, man, man, man, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: this foliage is where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Brazilian Red Hot, but if you have
one plant to buy for foliage for your
[SPEAKER_02]: landscapers, get this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Little Ruby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is low growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not more than six to eight inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays that color all season,
and it is just an extraordinary plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an Alternanthera copper leaf,
which nobody knows what to do with anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But full sun, it does very, very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colei are never going to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill was so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Salenistemin, okay, which is what
coleus were called.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew them as coleus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're all, all of a sudden,
Salenistemin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all now Plectranthus, for what
it's worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no such thing as coleus,
no such thing as Salenistemin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're all Plectranthus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly my daughter doesn't,
but they're great plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is up in Newfoundland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can, I mean, it's unbelievable what
we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love, there's Henna and Wasabi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's, I thought this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a little fun in your garden,
your nursery, your landscape, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody likes wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lady in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every plant in there is a vino dipped
in wine, bordo sangria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she has good parties, I want to tell
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's half the message here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when people come into your garden
center, for example, or ask your advice,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't really want to know every darn
thing that you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to know the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the taros are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: This came out of Hawaii, black coral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is up in Longwood in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not that far different than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mojito.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves mojito.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love that mojito.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one that we put out called
Jack's Giant.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's five foot, what did I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is she?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's five foot six.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is at Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can grow this great big stuff pretty
big as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we bring them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we make like good landscapers and just
let them die so we can get some something
[SPEAKER_02]: new next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do need heat to get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need the heat to get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that whole tropical look thing,
you know, and how you do it is up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly ornamental grasses,
the annual ornamental grasses are
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Princess and Princess Caroline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did all these in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prince and Princess, the first two we
introduced, and Caroline and Molly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Proven Winters introduced one of
ours as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is probably the most popular one
right now, fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say most popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to sell the most numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it'll flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's a Pennisetum flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any Pennisetum flower, this one will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to take a break from from
annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see in my handout, I got a ton of
perennials that you're just not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some other time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to take a little trending
look at this vegetable thing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think again, when when things were
really rough, veggies helped an awful lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always love vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be that we could say that women
like flowers and men love vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but that's no longer the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the vegetables are just everybody
wants vegetables today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me tell you again, you do not have
to believe a word I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The garden of tomorrow is the deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to be selling
vegetables for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going to have vegetable
gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going to have tomatoes taller
than I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going to have all that stuff
that's not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're thinking of getting my
neighbor, your friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you guys, if you go to if you go
to a gathering, and you're just talking
[SPEAKER_02]: with neighbors and friends or whatever,
and then somebody comes up and starts
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about plugs, and cultivars,
you know, you turn around and those 10
[SPEAKER_02]: people that were there, it's just you two
left, they don't want to hear about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but vegetables, everybody wants
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are we doing in vegetables these
days?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a major trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have absolutely no doubt that vegetables
will keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the big names are in there,
okay, whether it's burpee or whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: ball or whether it used to be that you had
some seed veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all the major breeders that were
breeding caliber colas are now breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have the distribution means
to get these out to you the garden
[SPEAKER_02]: centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're still going to buy your seed
from whatever, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is an opportunity now for you to
get some of the newer materials that are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming down easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you know, and they the
places like the burpees and the balls and
[SPEAKER_02]: the singentas and the whoever is they
going to give you POP material if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the landscapers and the gardeners,
this is the information that they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of Oh, yeah, it's a pretty good
tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it has wilt or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of interesting things
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: grafted vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, again, I don't want to belabor this
grafted vegetable thing that happens to me
[SPEAKER_02]: me and those vegetables are probably well,
he's all I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my tomatoes last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt the grafted vegetables
like the grafted tomatoes, grafted egg,
[SPEAKER_02]: all this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a it's from a company in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And called PPNL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nice thing about grafted is you
get a group stock that's much more disease
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant, and much more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a brand new wine, tomato that
you want it, but you don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, you'll get more yield, much more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys in the garden trade,
in the landscape trade, you might are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the retail trade, you might not be able to
sell that many because a tomato might sell
[SPEAKER_02]: for 398.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this sells for 1398.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to get a few in, people are
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my tomatoes by so so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So combo pellard seed offers are happening
to like this multi pellets is a fusible
[SPEAKER_02]: for the growers in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what we get is we get a plug that
comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that's the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get this plug that has two or three
seed materials in it, different lettuces,
[SPEAKER_02]: different whatevers plunk it in a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've got now you've got this
wonderful combination, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to see combinations this
afternoon, you're going to knock your
[SPEAKER_02]: socks off of vegetables and herbs and
colorful plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is where we're at, I think,
as far as this goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of breeding and selection for
this patio thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our at University of Georgia,
we started this 10 years ago, we started
[SPEAKER_02]: working with vegetalis and a few others to
see what was out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, this is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: This may never, ever look like this in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like that in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, these are this is the
sort of things that we're looking at or
[SPEAKER_02]: that the companies are looking at,
you know, grape type vines on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are available by the way,
anybody wants to try them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a tomato aficionado,
give them a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're absolutely available.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not just big things, but shorter,
more prolific plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you're going to see those this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the tomato, whether it's neat and
sweet, or this big league, I think is
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see some really cool
tomatoes this afternoon as well that have
[SPEAKER_02]: been bred for the patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big fruit, small plants, if we can get
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tomatoes, by the way, there's
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I mean, truly, I mean, it's,
it's like, it's like a whole different
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I mean, when people ask about
vegetables, they're usually asking about
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can grow a good tomato,
we're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of cool things happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that every ornamental breeder is
doing veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is it, I think it's an agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all the Asian vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Taki in Japan, they're
bringing Asian vegetables to the consumer,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, to you, the garden center,
or to you, the landscaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can put Asian vegetables in that
are new cultivars of which grow very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very strong and are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herb tray is exploding.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what it's worth on the app,
I've just partnered with the American Herb
[SPEAKER_02]: Society, and we're going to put herbs on
this app as well, because they are
[SPEAKER_02]: exploding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys, that's this is where these are
the trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what to do with this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tried this, Bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes as bad as it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hula berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's strawberry times something I'm
not sure what and I they put them out for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expect to see those sue in your place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's like it's like Brazel berries
and all these other kind of things where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're getting fruit in a container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might not like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: People talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the trends that are happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's always fun to see what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eggplants, big in containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think eggplants are really very,
very ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They truly are.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some eggplants in Chicago
Botanical Garden, eggplants with petunias
[SPEAKER_02]: in our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a real versatile plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's eggplants over here at the
garden you're going to see this afternoon
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think look very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's white.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's black.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's polka dotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you do with an eggplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big eggplant guy, but they look
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was somebody in Ohio who kind of
I thought this was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put together towers for potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to grow potatoes, but I don't have
the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she put together a tower with all sorts
of soil and pine straw and whatever and
[SPEAKER_02]: plugged her potatoes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had a nice yield of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the same gardener I thought was
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at these darn things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are going to be a whole lot
smarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say real people, a lot smarter than
we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do whatever it is that
they're going to need to do, but you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got to give them the good plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think this was really cool and
more power.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Oberlin, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, that person is quite a
gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, working and she's got no
more time than you or I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, this is some of the trends that
I'm seeing with veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Virginia, there really is a
ketchup and fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tomato grafted onto a potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't seen it and you don't
believe it, there's the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one again in California looking
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are talking about ketchup and
fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they sold every ketchup and fries
there was.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold every single plant that PPNL had
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they any good?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark says they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you eat the tomatoes, then the
potatoes do the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can do it, and sell it,
more power to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get one to my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now my neighbor doesn't do any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbor is your neighbor, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a frightened of gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try and give her some plants,
but she's got a young boy that throws a
[SPEAKER_02]: football and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't want too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, look, I have no place for this in
my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it got the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got the football.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got the soccer ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's doing okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's produced a lot of small fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fruit are small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's going to get any
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like heck right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty rough right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's about six feet tall right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of tomatoes on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how the potatoes are
going to do or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if it works, Mark,
we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to say any more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you sell grafted stuff in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you sell grafted tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much for?
[SPEAKER_00]: $7.90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the thing about this ketchup
and fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's in every magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: On every HGTV talks about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody talks about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see no problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see no problem here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you can see the deck in the
shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of beer, chips, and now tomatoes and
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if she can do it, and I say if she can
do it, she's a young mother and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Virginia, there is a ketchup and
fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some of the major trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't have time to go
through a whole heck of a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to call it a day right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is we got so many wonderful
things at our disposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the tiger by the tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got to make sure that we don't let
it bite us, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got people who are breeding new
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got people that can distribute
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got garden centers like the people
in the audience that can help my daughter
[SPEAKER_02]: and help your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we got to do is just say, hey,
we can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so tired of people saying,
oh, I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bogus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say more power to you, more power to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to see you this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have a good time then.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
