[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, everyone, for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the presence, I'm assuming we
have some coffee lovers or soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers or both or neither, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably here because you're taking
a class and you need to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm hoping that it'll be an insightful
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you some background information
about coffee production, in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of our coffee that we consume
is produced by smallholder farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been increasingly challenging for
them to keep up with production and earn a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent income because of the price
fluctuations, the market price
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from the 1970 to 2016,
you see drastic changes, which makes an
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent income for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue is drastic changes in
climate trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an article in The Guardian about
two and a half months ago about how
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change is predicted to have coffee
growing area that supports these
[SPEAKER_00]: smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil health actually can be a solution
in a sense that it may offer coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers a marketing advantage and
significant price premiums by promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FTP here, which is the Fair Trade
Proof, is just one example of an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization that provides price premiums
based on social, economic, and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes these price premiums can be
so high to be double what your regular
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity price is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose of this multidisciplinary
study
[SPEAKER_00]: is to identify the characteristics of soil
health in Colombian coffee systems to
[SPEAKER_00]: better address the issues of economic,
social, and environmental sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outline is, so the study consists
of three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part is a very sociological,
anthropological-based study that consists
[SPEAKER_00]: of understanding soil health in a
sociological way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have farmers' perception in
Colombian coffee systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part is to determine the
association between coffee cup quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third part is a comparative
analysis of the different regional scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our study was located in six
municipalities within the department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Calca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department is equivalent to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Calca is located in the southwest part
of Colombia, and farms in each
[SPEAKER_00]: municipality either belonged to the local
coffee co-op or didn't belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were members or non-member farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the member farms, two soil samples
were collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most fertile sample, as indicated by
the farmer, so we went to the farmer and
[SPEAKER_00]: we told him, okay, we want you to identify
in your farm the most fertile plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we sampled that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the least fertile, and the same thing
as indicated by the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a representative sample,
one representative sample was collected
[SPEAKER_00]: from the non-member farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is great information to assess the
perception of farmers of soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the samples were collected,
they were sent to the soil health lab
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and a number of physical,
chemical, and biological indicators were
[SPEAKER_00]: measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical indicators included wet aggregate
stability, which is measured using a
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall simulator, which delivers 12.5
millimeters of water in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And available water capacity, which is
measured using pressure chambers that
[SPEAKER_00]: extract water at two different pressures,
the 10 kilopascal and the 15 kilopascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological indicators included organic
matter, which is measured based on loss
[SPEAKER_00]: and ignition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active carbon, which is measured with
potassium permanganate oxidation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and measured with a 550 nanometer
spectrophotometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil respiration measured by capturing CO2
in a four day incubation using potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil protein index, which is
extracted with a citrate buffer under high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the chemical indicators included
pH, measured in a one to one water slurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, potassium, and the
micronutrients were all extracted with
[SPEAKER_00]: modified morgan, and quantified with the
ICP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil health scoring was undertaken
using a cumulative normal distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cumulative normal distribution is
the derivative of the Gaussian
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you the probability that a
member of the distribution is less or
[SPEAKER_00]: equal to your measured soil health
indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you look at active
carbon, if we look at the measurement 600,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you derive the distribution,
600 would be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you that the score would be 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some way, you can look at it as a
ranking scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parameters for mu and sigma,
which is the population mean and the
[SPEAKER_00]: population standard deviation,
were either estimated from local
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done where thresholds and
critical values for specific soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators have not been established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the literature, it's nearly
impossible to find the thresholds or the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum levels for available water
capacity, organic matter, active carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, respiration, and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, you estimate the
population mean in the standard deviation
[SPEAKER_00]: using the sample mean and the standard
deviation, the sample being the n equals
[SPEAKER_00]: 223.
[SPEAKER_00]: For parameters, the parameters were also
determined from existing critical values
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the literature specific to coffee
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hence was the case for potassium,
magnesium, zinc, manganese, and iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet aggregate stability was the exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet aggregate stability, when you plot the
distribution, it's very left skewed in
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of the measurements were on the
high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used the measured values as the
scores themselves, because the measured
[SPEAKER_00]: values is a percent based measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then overall soil health is computed
as the undefined unweighted arithmetic
[SPEAKER_00]: mean of individual soil health indicators,
meaning that you calculate the scores for
[SPEAKER_00]: each individual for all of the indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take the mean and you get
your overall soil health score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are what the soil health scoring
curves look like for each indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two things to note in this
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some scoring curves follow a more is
better curve, which is the case for the
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them followed a optimum
range curve, which was the case for pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them followed a less is
better, which is manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the less manganese you have,
the higher score your soil has.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing to note about this graph
is that some indicators required
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting for texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we adjusted them for texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the indicators that showed
significant difference in measured values
[SPEAKER_00]: between the different textural classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was AWC, organic matter,
active carbon, and respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not develop curves for coarse
textured soils, because we did not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: representative sample of coarse textured
soils coming from Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part of the multidisciplinary
study is understanding soil health and
[SPEAKER_00]: associated farmers' perceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objectives were to determine the
geodemographic and environmental factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that play a role in farmers' perception of
soil health and its accuracy, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee farmers have accurate perceptions
of soil health, and the soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators most associated with farmers'
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: The statistical analyses used here were
ANOVA for factors influencing soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: and farmers' soil health perception
accuracy, a Fisher's exact test for count
[SPEAKER_00]: data which is a more accurate test than
chi-square and the g-test when your sample
[SPEAKER_00]: size is less than 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used that for the factors
influencing farmers' soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: perception accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also did a logistic regression
and a principal component analysis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health indicators most affecting
farmers' perceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these box plots, we have soil health
score on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gender, municipality, and
membership variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our results actually show that female
farmers have significantly higher soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health than male farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone needs to tell this to Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be interesting to see
what his reaction would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So furthermore, we saw significant
difference among municipalities in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosa is having the lowest mean and Cajibio
having the highest mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that members have
significantly higher soil health than
[SPEAKER_00]: non-member for co-ops, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the services provided by
the co-op have measurable positive impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our results also show that coffee farmers
have correct perceptions of their soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the y-axis, again, we have the soil
health score, the measured soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: score from the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the perceived soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what they ranked most fertile
and least fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, we did find that the most
fertile, what they specify to be most
[SPEAKER_00]: fertile, was significantly higher than the
least fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, when we were interested in seeing
what factors influences farmers'
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of soil health, when we looked
at gender, we saw that there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference in terms of their
perception accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their ability to perceive their soil
accurately did not differ between gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not also differ between
municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw that it did differ based on the
actual soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that farmers who had higher soil
health were better at predicting their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this by this significant
linear model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a principal component analysis is a
great way to visualize patterns and really
[SPEAKER_00]: describe your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you detect variables and
attributes that have high impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really useful for dimension
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to achieve a parsimonious
model, then a PCA would be a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used PCA for the logistic regressions,
which I'll show next, to assess which
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators affect farmers' perception of
soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first principal component,
which explains 34% of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, you can see that it's very
biological heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the indicators are biological,
and we do have some physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second principal component
analysis explains 17% of the variability
[SPEAKER_00]: and is very chemical-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sake of having a parsimonious
model, we used the values with strong
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the ones in bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our logistic regression showed that
organic matter, protein, and respirations
[SPEAKER_00]: are indicators that are more related to
soil health perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter had a significant positive
relationship with farmers' perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter is a very effective way of
assessing your soil health when measured
[SPEAKER_00]: data are lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein also had a significant positive
relationship with soil health perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I can explain this is protein
is basically the nitrogen-bound organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, the farmers have a perception
of the importance of nitrogen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of nitrogen, and that somehow
translates into being able to perceive
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that respiration is
also significant, but it's negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way I was able to interpret
this is that the farmers seem to confound,
[SPEAKER_00]: are confused between beneficial biological
activity and detrimental infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which throws off their perception
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way I was able to
interpret this, and I'm happy to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: input at the end of the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second part of the study was to
assess whether soil health has an effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on coffee cup quality, so to assess the
existence and the relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The existence and the nature of the
relationship between coffee cup quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil health, and the soil health
indicators that are main predictors of
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee sensorial attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected 68 member farms that were
demarcated by 20 by 50 meter quadrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did an inventory for tree
density, which is a proxy for shade
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, which literature has shown to
have a positive impact on cup quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also elevation of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee cherries were also sampled,
and the statistical analyses used were the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation matrix and linear regressions
to assess the relationship between coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and soil health, and a best subset
regression for coffee sensorial attributes
[SPEAKER_00]: to soil health indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a coffee report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coffee is assessed by a professional
certified cupper that assesses a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: physical sensorial attributes and also
granulometric, which is a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: sieving tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a list of all of the sensorial
attributes and the physical attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the individual scores are
composited, and you have a total coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correlation coefficient of coffee
quality scores with soil health indicators
[SPEAKER_00]: show that available water capacity and
organic matter are significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively correlated with coffee cup
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see a negative correlation with
phosphorus and iron, but a positive with
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we run a linear regression,
we first use a full linear model with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil health indicators,
the number of trees, and the elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our model did not come out to be
significant at all, and we had a negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: which indicates that it's a very poor
linear model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we did a best subset
regression of the five best predictors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are in bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we extracted these and ran their
separate linear model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start to see
significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you see a negative correlation
with organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimates are negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein, respiration has a positive
estimate, and then pH and iron have a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these findings are puzzling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that higher soil health is
better in every dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after much thought, we think that
coffee might actually be very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevines, and that you don't necessarily
want high soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that additional organic matter or
water holding capacity or pH doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily translate to better coffee
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see, again, this trade-off
between quantity and quality, where this
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer has to decide whether to maximize
yields or achieve premium coffee quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the micronutrients that we
see here, I looked at the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I still don't know how that translates
into coffee cup quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a best subset regression was used for
predicting coffee sensorial traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see all of the sensorial traits
here and all of the soil health indicators
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed that iron, phosphorus,
and wet aggregate stability were
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent in predicting coffee sensorial
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the best three predictors of
coffee sensorial traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a fairly good R-squared value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is important because it could
provide an alternative to the different
[SPEAKER_00]: sensorial assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third and last part of the study
involved a comparison of the regional soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health scoring frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this in an attempt to assess the
feasibility ability of developing global
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health standards, which sort of
aligns with the NRCS goals of achieving
[SPEAKER_00]: national soil health standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the objectives were to assess
whether different regional scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks yield similar results and to
develop a simplified version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian coffee soil health scoring
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, the 223 samples were subjected
to three type of indicator and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scores were compared using a t-test
and an inter-rater reliability test,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives you the ICC, an inter-class
correlation coefficient, which gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of agreement between the
different ranking mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an ICC of 0.2 or below,
you have poor agreement between the
[SPEAKER_00]: different scoring mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And above 0.8 is on an almost perfect
agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, there exists three regional
scoring curves that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comprehensive assessment of soil
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the scoring framework developed at
Cornell specific to the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian coffee soil health scoring
specific to Cauca, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Western Kenya soil health scoring
functions, which were developed by Bianca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you know Bianca and colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are what the different scoring
functions look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are categorized by the textural
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fine texture soil, medium texture soil,
and coarse texture soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are for the different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, SEND is the cumulative normal
distribution, which is the derivative of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Gaussian distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you compare, if we take,
for instance, if we look at wet aggregate
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, aggregate stability, again,
we use the measured values to score the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate stability in the Cauca,
Colombia's framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you compare Western Kenya and the
Northeast, you see some differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the scoring function,
which is composed of the mean and the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see 58 and 43, 19 and 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is about a 15% difference between
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go across the different scoring
textures, you could also see that in
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, they're fairly close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing for available water
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, in medium texture soils,
the mean for Western Kenya and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast are identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the standard deviations are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just the different scoring
functions by textural class and by region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So additionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also developed a methodological
framework, which we named the weighted
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian coffee soil health scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the overall soil health was computed
in this framework as a weighted mean of
[SPEAKER_00]: the individuals soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember, the approach that we
used previously was as an unweighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a mean, a regular mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was weighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weights were determined using a
PCA, where the sum of the eigenvectors of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first four principal components were
the actual weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here that that
biological indicator seems to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this will make Janice really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the formula for the weighted
overall soil health is basically the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health indicator times its weight,
so on, over the sum of the weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two things to note in this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the t-test shows that the different
scoring mechanisms yield significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: different scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some cases, the ICC,
the intercorrelation coefficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: was high, which indicates that there is
actually a strong agreement between the
[SPEAKER_00]: different scoring mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the case for wet aggregate
stability protein and the overall soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other cases, the results from the
t-test matched the results from the
[SPEAKER_00]: intercorrelation coefficients,
meaning that the different scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms yield significantly different
scores, and so that the different scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the case for organic matter,
respiration pH, and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to interpret this discrepancy
between ICC and the t-test, between the
[SPEAKER_00]: intercorrelation coefficient and the
t-test, is that although sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: t-test indicates that they are
significantly different, in reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not, because the different scoring
mechanisms seem to generate scores that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the same range, meaning that 99 and
94 and 96, they're all high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't maybe, the means are
significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the three scoring mechanisms
consistently score the soils high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing for the overall
soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're consistently medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other cases, they were
significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, given the financial the
logistical and the resource constraints of
[SPEAKER_00]: smallholder farmers in Columbia,
we tried to develop a simplified and less
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive version of soil health
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this using a best subset
regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best subset regression is a type of
regression that models all possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically generates all possible
models based on a specified number of
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want one predictor, it'll give
you the best model with one single
[SPEAKER_00]: predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could also choose a set of two or
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at the best single
predictor, active carbon had very high
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive power in predicting overall
soil health, followed by organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great finding because of the
nature of the active carbon assessment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very easy and very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all you need is some potassium
permanganate and a small field
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrophotometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have your active carbon
measurement in a matter of 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you add other indicators for
higher predictive power, that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: see protein and respiration play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And predicting overall soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not until groups of three where
you start seeing some chemical indicators
[SPEAKER_00]: as major predictors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have we learned from this big
multidisciplinary study?
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that female farmers and co-op
members have significantly higher soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health than their counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers appear to have correct perception
of their soil health, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with their gender or
municipality, but with how healthy their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter, respiration, and protein
are indicators that are most related to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers' perceptions of their soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also learned that coffee quality is
significantly higher with lower soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, water holding capacity,
and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And iron, phosphorus, and wet aggregate
stability were consistently best at
[SPEAKER_00]: predicting coffee sensorial attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, in the last part, we learned that
achieving global soil health standards is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, especially when only considering
the indicators that showed a high ICC,
[SPEAKER_00]: an intercorrelation coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also learned that active carbon is a
great test that can highly predict overall
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health and can be used in a
simplified version of a soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'd like to acknowledge my
source of funding, the NSF GRFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my major advisor,
Harold, who's been mentoring me ever since
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a dumb undergrad and been very
patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miguel Gomez, who hired me as an
undergraduate research assistant my senior
[SPEAKER_00]: year and who got me involved in this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Hobbs, whose invaluable
international work has really taken this
[SPEAKER_00]: research to a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank Kirsten Kurtz and Bob
from the soil health team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten was the one who taught me
everything about soil health and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: run all the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started working in the soil
health lab, I started with the Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob, who's been behind it all,
just organizing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Stephen Perry from the Cornell
Statistical Consulting Unit, who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: giving me statistical advice throughout
all these chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the story behind this slide is
actually pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just your regular thank you
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was doing the literature review
for the third part about the global soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health standards, I did so much literature
review that it was a pain in the neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to teach myself how to read
dense academic papers in four different
[SPEAKER_00]: languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to learn how to read papers in
Portuguese and Spanish and French,
[SPEAKER_00]: which thankfully I already know,
and English, of course, I already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the languages that I used in
my literature review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
