[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like trailed off with my drear
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I posted two, but they were pretty
comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I just fell into a hole of
insanity because we had a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really busy year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this makes up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear about everything I did
between the last update and now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as was said, I went to Australia to
pursue my interest in grapes, wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and relations to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be lots of animal pictures
in this presentation because I love
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, and there's lots of cool ones in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get into the nitty gritty
academic stuff, I thought I'd give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some fun background about other things I
learned in Australia not related to
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the scariest was how to drive a
manual car on the wrong side of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now trying to readjust to the right
side of the road, so always a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to live involuntarily with very large
spiders that are very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called huntsmen because they run
after their prey and they don't build
[SPEAKER_00]: webs, so they are just gone like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did play one game of cricket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really understand the rules,
but they told me what to do, and I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I played cricket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to understand Australians.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck are they saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can abbreviate a word, they will
abbreviate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't abbreviate a word,
they will still manage to abbreviate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's like a completely different
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to Australia, as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a map showing you the wine regions
of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty big continent, lots of wine
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was based right... Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No laser?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was based right here in this
green area.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Australia, which is actually
producing more than 50% of Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the largest production area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was right here in the middle of all this
at the University of Adelaide,
[SPEAKER_00]: smack in the middle of the wine regions of
South Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had research projects up in the
river land, which is that yellow squarish
[SPEAKER_00]: area to the northeast, which is very hot,
very intensive agriculture, high yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had research sites down in the
southeast, in Kunawara, which is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: orange region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cooler climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we had work at the
University Vineyard in the middle where
[SPEAKER_00]: the star is.
[SPEAKER_00]: One interesting thing about South
Australia is it's a quarantine area for
[SPEAKER_00]: phylloxera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no phylloxera there,
meaning it has some of the oldest vines in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of un-grafted vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still graft for other reasons,
but it's pretty cool to work along side
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of year old vines there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was working with Dr. Vinay Pagay,
who many, some of you here might be
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely incredible guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife Fran, who is an amazing friend to
me while I was there, and the rest of his
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, who are all wonderful people from all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had just an incredible experience
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll kind of break down for you what I
did this year because the Drear Award was
[SPEAKER_00]: only supposed to be for the first half of
the year, but I was there until last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pretty much had a full year in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll explain to you what that
consisted of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in their summer fall, which is our
winter spring here, I was doing the Drear
[SPEAKER_00]: Award Pagay lab intern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just participating in all of his
research projects all over the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: South Australia, collecting data,
analyzing data, preparing publications,
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also had a partnership part time job
with the AWRI, which is the Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine Research Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the weekends during harvest,
I was working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making small lot research wines,
applying treatments, basically seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: wines through from grapes to bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really great experience for
me because it added to my overall
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge base of viticulture and
etiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the second half of the year,
Vinay actually took me on as a technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that involved some taste testing of
the wines in the places we were working,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that everything's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was also working for the
university's research vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a technician, I was doing lots of
practical things like driving the tractor,
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying, slashing, mowing, repairing
irrigation, getting those practical skills
[SPEAKER_00]: under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great, awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between it all, I traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw lots of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I traveled some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy with all the animals
I met this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my schedule was flexible enough that
it allowed me to do that, which was really
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the million dollar question is,
how many projects does Vinay have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because any of you who know him know that
he is just unstoppable, so passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he takes on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never says no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't tell you how many projects he
has, even though that was kind of my job,
[SPEAKER_00]: was to know how many projects he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because almost every week, he'd be talking
to me about some other projects that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I thought I'm your
technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'm supposed to know these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were just too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even count.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to give you a little bit of a sample,
this is one of his new PhD students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's working on volatile signaling
for drought stress in grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's starting off as a greenhouse
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had, I wrote about this in my blog
post once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is continuous sensing of grapevine
water status using infrared cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was down in Kunura.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's trying to develop an index that
will correlate this thermal data to vine
[SPEAKER_00]: water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a lot of time helping on that
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That project also involves flying
airplanes with multispectral cameras over
[SPEAKER_00]: the vineyards, which was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to see this airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year in Kunura, he has a new project
on berry cell death and how that relates
[SPEAKER_00]: to berry shrivel, which is a concern for
them down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fluorescent microscopy image
that I made of a berry that I sliced and
[SPEAKER_00]: stained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we run that through a computer
program to see how much cell death is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's ongoing this coming year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still got his microtensiometer
project happening, which some of you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be familiar with, which is that chip that
sits in the vine xylem and monitors water
[SPEAKER_00]: status continuously as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's also working on hyperspectral
imagery or laser hyperspectral sensing of
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we have this backpack
contraption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully he wants to put this on a
drone with a camera and just get
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperspectral images of vineyards to
detect viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a small sample of Vinay's
ongoing work that I got to participate in,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I am going to talk to you about a
project that I worked intensively on,
[SPEAKER_00]: active canopy cooling strategies to
mitigate negative effects of heat waves on
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave this presentation a few weeks
ago at the CRUSH seminar at the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Adelaide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, hopefully it goes nice and
smooth this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to climate change, the reason I
went to Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the world, obviously,
agriculture is going to have to contend
[SPEAKER_00]: with the effects of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Australia, where most wine growing
regions are semi-arid and Mediterranean
[SPEAKER_00]: climates, we have to worry about the
seasons getting hotter and drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're worried about a few things not
limited to compressed growing seasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means hotter, shorter seasons,
a dual warming effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most models are predicting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage to reproductive organ development,
which is the flowers, which then results
[SPEAKER_00]: in our fruit, the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Failure of flavor and aroma development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of heat can squash out those
compounds that we look for in quality
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall water scarcity across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just in viticulture, but all
agricultural pursuits are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with water scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the coming decades,
I want to be like a world famous
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to deal with this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we stop emitting carbon today,
right now, even if we shut off all our
[SPEAKER_00]: cars and stop eating beef, we're still
going to be dealing with the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change in the years to come
because the climate has inertia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, the best risk management
strategy is adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a graph that I put together of
the historical occurrence of heat waves up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Riverland, which was that
Northeastern yellow area that I discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really hot, high intensity
agriculture, high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, 16-17, we only had four
heat waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's relatively fewer than in
previous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we only expect that trend to increase
as the years go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we define a heat wave for our
study for this purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: We define a heat wave as three days or
more of 35 degrees Celsius or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we arrived at that definition using
the Greer and Whedon paper, where they
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that at that threshold,
we were seeing negative effects on vine
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology and grape and wine quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as active canopy cooling goes,
the whole point of this presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not too much in the field on
active canopy cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 70s in California, Algebra and
Gilbert looked at overhead sprinkling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did have some success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't really been touched since.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, last year, Caravia at the
University of Adelaide investigated in
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy cooling, so misting in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have an extension of that
project happening this year that I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into that one in depth
for this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm happy to talk about it with any of
you if you're curious later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our objectives for this work were to
evaluate the vine performance during the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the canopy microclimate,
so the temperature, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the effects on grape and
wine quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were up in the riverland.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we were working with a
commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Sauvignon Blanc vines, four cordon
sprawl, absolutely huge vines,
[SPEAKER_00]: very high yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had these two trials at the same
site right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The in canopy cooling trial, which was a
misting in the canopy trial that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll talk about later if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the under canopy cooling trial,
which is of special interest to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we'll talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the under canopy cooling trial,
or UCC, had two treatments compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control was your traditional drip line
irrigation, grower controlled,
[SPEAKER_00]: just your regular drip line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The under canopy sprinklers, the first
treatment, or UCS, were basically
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast sprinklers that wet the entire
mid-row of the vineyard floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the vine, in the middle of the
vine, everywhere was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the supplemental irrigation,
or SI, was a bypass drip line that
[SPEAKER_00]: deposited the same volume of water,
but directly under the vine, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, like the UCS did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put the same amount of water just under
the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important thing about these
treatments is to keep in mind that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were on at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we saw a heat wave was coming up,
we would trigger the system to go on the
[SPEAKER_00]: night before and all of the nights during
the heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this wasn't happening during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected a lot of data,
because Vinay loves data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am going to primarily talk to you
about the data we collected on the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimate, the leaf gas exchange,
and the soil and plant water statuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't worry, we also looked at a lot
of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would take me a long time to go
through, but we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of our IRGA,
or infrared gas analyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by Lycor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this machine was initially very scary
to me, but now I'm intimately acquainted
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use it a lot this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps us understand the
photosynthesis and the stomata conductance
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some graphs I put together of
the temperature and the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit at the hottest part of the day
during a heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was three or more days at 35 C or
greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular day was over 40 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dot dash line on the bottom of
both graphs is the under canopy sprinkler,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the UCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the temperature of the
UCS treatment stayed below 40 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: even at the hottest part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vapor pressure deficit was below 5
kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember that these treatments were on
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this effect in the middle
of the day, which is pretty awesome,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see basically more ideal
physiological conditions for physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: function during this heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the UCS treatment, while the SI and the
control are much hotter and drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are a couple of thermal images we put
together so you can kind of visualize
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening in the mid row and the
under vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the control, you had a really hot mid
row, 45 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the supplemental irrigation,
it was cooler at 38.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was coolest in the under canopy
sprinklers at 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same trend is happening under the
vine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we will go into the soil and plant
water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top graph is pre-dawn water potential,
my favorite measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 o'clock in the morning, we go out and we
do pressure bombing, which is take a leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a chamber, put pressure on it,
and see how much pressure it takes to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a drop of water come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the pre-dawn, that gives us an idea
of soil moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pre-dawn water potential correlates
with soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we take that measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the bottom graph is mid-day stem
water potential, which gives us an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil water status, plant water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, again, mid heat wave in
the middle of a heat wave, the control is
[SPEAKER_00]: the black, the supplemental irrigation is
the checkered, and the under canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinklers is the gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no significant differences
in soil water status across any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know, based on that, that we are not
having an irrigation effect with these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of this research is not to
irrigate the vines, it's to actively cool
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we apply water so that it has a
cooling effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not intended to irrigate the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on that lack of significance in
the top graph, lack of difference in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, we see no irrigation effect,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look down at the mid-day water
potential and we see that the control is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly lower than the two
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control is relatively water
stressed during this heat wave compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the two treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are no differences between the
SI and the UCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind while we move to this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, middle of a heat wave,
top graph, AN, net photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom graph, GS, stomatal conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the control in both
the photosynthesis and the conductance has
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly lower rates for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easily explained by the fact that
the plant is water stressed, as we saw in
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous slide, looking at the mid-day
stem water potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, curiously, we see a difference
between the two treatments for both
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't explain the difference in
photosynthesis for the two treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: based on water status, because we saw here
that there was no difference in water
[SPEAKER_00]: status for the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to explain this somehow out
some other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two theories that we will,
or not we, they will investigate further
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I can't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first being that perhaps,
because in the supplemental irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone is very wet, it's
concentrated directly under the vine,
[SPEAKER_00]: a wet area, that abscisic acid,
or ABA, is being translocated up from the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone to the leaves, and closing the
stomata, down-regulating photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: and stomatal conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might not be happening in the
UCS, because the water is distributed all
[SPEAKER_00]: across the vineyard floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another possibility is simply that the
canopy microclimate in the UCS is more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable for photosynthesis and stomatal
conductance in the middle of a heat wave,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we saw that it's a lot cooler and
less dry, lower vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: during the heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that soil evaporation can just be
promoting overall more ideal conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: for canopy function during a heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as other results go,
we saw significantly higher TA,
[SPEAKER_00]: or tritratable acidity, in the UCS and SI
treatment wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great, because we want to
preserve acidity through these heat
[SPEAKER_00]: events, loss of acidity in must or grapes
after a heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat events is something we don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see any differences in yield,
but we can conclude that the UCS treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: is effectively cooling the canopy and
promoting ideal conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological function during heat waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask me why I don't think we saw
many more results than this this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because it wasn't such a hot
year for Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you saw in the first graph,
there were four heat waves, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: so much for this climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in future years,
when it's hotter and drier and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: more heat events, you might see these
treatments start to separate in other
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's my theory as to why there
wasn't so many differences this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this coming season, we're going to,
they're going to, characterize the root
[SPEAKER_00]: density and distribution and evaluate the
soil moisture and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we didn't do that last year,
we really don't know what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there roots in the mid-row?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they active?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the soil temperature and moisture
in those areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can really help us hone in on our
theories as to why we saw those
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also going to sample abscisic
acid, or ABA, at time points before,
[SPEAKER_00]: during, and after heat waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see if there's any differences
in that hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this project, I'd like to thank
Wine Australia for their funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxford Landing Estates was our cooperating
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of people in our lab and outside
of our lab who helped on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were awesome, and they really saved
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this entire experience overall,
I'd like to thank the Drer committee,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nina, Marvin, John, and I have to thank
Fran, Vinay, and the whole lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: For just making this year beyond
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say enough good things about
the Drer Award, or about Vinay and his
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, because they're just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'd like to thank everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: I also work on the drought and heat.
And we have a problem with the spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: The spraying is two problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, it causes more viruses or
parasites.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when the canopy is humid,
and the loss of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just mix to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't do it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the question is about disease
pressure with a wet canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use nets to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shade cloth is absolutely one option to
cool your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's work on that, as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Australia, in this very dry climate,
we did not see any increase in disease
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was really like, it was
negligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the Finger Lakes, it wouldn't
be possible to do in canopy misting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just be a disaster,
probably, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this hot, dry climate, it's really
not even a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing I thought when I
got there, because I was cool climate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioned when I got over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't see any disease incidence
increase with that in canopy misting
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer it?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much water would you use each night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Connor asked me about how much water
was applied at night for those treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to pull up that
information, because I don't want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the wrong answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of water, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our point is to preserve or increase
the quality, maintain the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: or make it better, going into these really
hot seasons that we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to use more water,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the best way to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we just irrigate, or should we try
something like this, like active canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a valid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm trying to find this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I calibrated the system before I left,
but I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the sprinklers turned on for
30 minutes every hour and a half for a
[SPEAKER_00]: total of four cycles throughout the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flow rate was 57 liters per vine
per night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, for the whole year in the
under canopy sprinkler treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water application for the season was
5.6 megaliters per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compare that to the grower
irrigation, the grower irrigation is 7.7
[SPEAKER_00]: megaliters per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that give you some context?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does the misting cooling down in
fact last?
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you turn on the mist at night,
and then during the day, when does it dry
[SPEAKER_04]: out, or does the temperature increase
during the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this under canopy cooling trial,
so this is not the in canopy misting trial
[SPEAKER_00]: that I briefly mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this under canopy trial,
you can see that the temperature was
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the in canopy misting, which I did not
present the data on, the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped very quickly, 5 to 8 degrees
Celsius in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it came back up almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this year, they're going to tweak
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're modeling it and trying to see
what is the optimal frequency and duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of misting to maintain the canopy
temperature at or below 35C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal, ideally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my follow up question is, if you give
the vines a sense of, yeah, it's not so
[SPEAKER_04]: hot, and then they open their stomata and
do the photosynthesis, because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical response, as you mentioned in the
rules, the ADA and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they get really hot,
would that be something to consider a
[SPEAKER_04]: negative effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, because when we have
these really intense heat events,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vines are often shutting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're stopping physiological
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you might be losing some of your
desirable components in the grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma compounds, and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when we harvested this trial,
the cooperating grower was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest just about the same time as us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they held off almost a week and a half
to two weeks after, because we harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: right after a heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to wait for the vines to
build up more sugar, because they had just
[SPEAKER_00]: shut down at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're worried about hotter,
shorter seasons and faster ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also worried about vines just
quitting when it's too hot, and then loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of those desirable characteristics in your
grapes and wine during those really high
[SPEAKER_00]: heat events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Geneva, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: One question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Raquel.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Tim Martinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Tim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you comment on, you know, given the
water shortage and the droughts that they
[SPEAKER_06]: have, what is the industry in general
doing to address the water shortage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they using different methods of
scheduling irrigation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what's the response been to the drought
in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, last year was actually
not a drought at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very wet year for Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I was there, that's not a good
example, because they had more rain in
[SPEAKER_00]: their growing season than we had in our
2016 growing season, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was pretty amazed to tell you the
truth about the lack of a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: response to these drought events or
irrigation in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of our cooperating growers
were asking Vinay like, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do we how do we schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, when do we irrigate?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we go by like touching the
leaves or visual clues or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really amazing to see that
there is like a lack of knowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow them to respond to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's exactly like what he's
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to see that our work is very
needed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really a grower by grower like
everyone had their own response,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn on the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the leaves look a little hot and
tilted away from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should turn it on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really not consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Australian viticulture and winemaking
overall, I think, is very technology
[SPEAKER_00]: savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really on the cutting edge,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that they didn't have a
consistent response was just, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we need this work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they not using regulated deficit
irrigation or partial root zone drying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were developed in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't see any partial root
zone drying there, personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think some people use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the sites that I visited were
doing anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's RDI.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of people are really at a
loss as to like what the best route going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward is for irrigation scheduling and
dealing with these heat events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my honest perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone could tell me otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I heard it from more than one grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not making this argument.
[SPEAKER_07]: But how would you respond to this argument
that, look, climate's getting hotter.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running out of good water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this really a good use of our scarce
resources?
[SPEAKER_07]: And at one point, should we kind of pull
the plug on trying to grow grapes in
[SPEAKER_07]: Australia anyways?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how can we do this more sustainably
longer?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what's the logic there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a valid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not prepared, personally,
to give up my Australian wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that there is recourse,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think agriculture in Australia needs to
undergo some changes as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they're still growing rice in this
same region of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that is ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having rice paddies in the outback,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not to be like, I don't know,
speciest, but I would prioritize improving
[SPEAKER_00]: grape quality over growing rice in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the almost Australian outback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole point of this is to see,
how can we do it as efficiently as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how should we apply it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will make the biggest difference
for our quality with using the least water
[SPEAKER_00]: possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a sufficient answer, Zach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's one right answer for
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just carrying through your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we irrigate the roots to decrease
temperature?
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question, I think, was,
we are applying water under the canopy to
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the temperature of the canopy of
the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were two, like I said before,
there were two experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the in canopy cooling
experiment, which is misters inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this under canopy
cooling experiment, which was misting on
[SPEAKER_00]: the vineyard floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's two separate experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, under canopy cooling,
was applying water broadcast to the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, in canopy cooling,
had misters inside the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the canopy, there was free water
directed to the punch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sprayer system in the canopy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne?
[SPEAKER_00]: The root turnover rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Anne wants to know if we're looking at
the root turnover rate in the under canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkler treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually haven't looked at anything
below ground yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this coming year is going to be all
about what's going on underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know almost nothing about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be the key to explaining a
lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know when they tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about the analysis method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked me what method of ABA analysis
we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure about the chemical
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how we collect it, or we will collect
it, is when we do the pressure bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do that midday stem water potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the leaf in the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water droplet comes out of the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pipette that into a little
vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only need, I think, a tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else?
Questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
