[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're all having a wonderful,
amazing Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Lu Vignale, Lucia Vignale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the organizer of the webinar this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a third year PhD candidate in the
Larry Smart Lab at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'm working on Father Meldud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two featured speakers for today,
Chadwick White and Kim Mayo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are joining us from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chadwick White is the chief visionary
officer, chief innovation officer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and co-founder of NEPA Foods, a leader in
allergen-free and plant-based food and
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredient solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: With over 35 years of experience in the
food industry, he holds a master baker
[SPEAKER_02]: certification and has pioneered
innovations in gluten-free and hemp-based
[SPEAKER_02]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chadwick co-founded Udys Gluten Free Food,
growing it to over $125 million in revenue
[SPEAKER_02]: before its acquisition by Boulder Brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kimberly Mayo is an experienced registered
dietitian and accountant manager with a
[SPEAKER_02]: strong background in nutrition science and
regulatory compliance within the CPG food
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: After working in hospital and community
education settings, she wanted to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: the food options available on store
shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting diagnosed with celiac disease in
2010, she only strengthened her passion
[SPEAKER_02]: about improving the nutrient density of
gluten and allergen-free foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: which began her path to working with
DEPRA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they start sharing their
experiences and insights, I want to remind
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone to use the chat for greetings and
other communications, but please submit
[SPEAKER_02]: the questions for Chadwick and Kim using
the Q&A button.
[SPEAKER_02]: The talk would last approximately 30
minutes, followed by a Q&A session.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll then wrap up and thank them for
their time and insights.
[SPEAKER_02]: All webinars are recorded and uploaded to
our School of Integrative Plant Science
[SPEAKER_02]: SIPs YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to check out the previous ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chadwick, Kim, our virtual stage is all
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exciting for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: On hemp and how it performs in food seems
to be a new category for many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the features and the
understanding and the interest in hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past has been around cannabinoids and
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to show what the seed,
the protein specifically from the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: does in food formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm incredibly excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazingly versatile ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start sharing my screen and
go through presentation that we put
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly a collection of photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just start explaining a
little bit about what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Lucia had mentioned, I'm a certified
master baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the bakery industry for 37
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off in conventional bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1998, I got my certification as a
master baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2001, I moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years later, I met a woman
with severe food allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: She introduced me to the free from market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous to that, I had really had no
exposure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I specialized in product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately started formulating products
for her and for her children who are both
[SPEAKER_00]: celiac.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years later, this really changed the
course of my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years later, I had a full
suite of formulations and started looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for business partners to bring those to
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Met a couple of guys here in Colorado,
Udi and Itay Barone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started a company called Udi's Gluten
Free Foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a tremendous amount during that
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was that we really needed to work more
on the specific ingredients available for
[SPEAKER_00]: bakers baking gluten-free products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ingredients had to be designed
specifically for gluten-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing was that we needed much
better nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The formulations at that time,
even though they were decent, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post Udi's, we started a company called
Gluten Free Baking Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: That company and a couple of others,
a sprouting and malting company and a
[SPEAKER_00]: blending company, all got rolled together
into what is today NEPRA Foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: NEPRA is actually an adjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Esperanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really how we view what we do every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just create ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the greater market, we also create
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really center around better for you and
nutritious eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: With me today is Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is our registered dietitian,
our project manager, our account manager,
[SPEAKER_00]: our everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is actually our internal rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to have her here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through some of the applications
of the hemp in food, and then I'll pass it
[SPEAKER_00]: over to Kim at the last half to discuss
the nutrition a little bit more at length,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot to unpack there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we'll go over these points here
in just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What our general mission is, why we're so
interested in hemp, and then some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's versatility, the functionality,
what foods it's really suited well for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some CPG brands that are starting
to launch into the market today with hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, those things that Kim
will address, the nutrition, and then some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other things that we'd love to see
moving forward from institutions like
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell as they put together their hemp
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some requests, some things that we
would like to see done in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: NEPRA, we really are interested in making
food for everyone, allergen-free foods
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste great, that there's nothing
lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want our consumers to feel like
they're getting less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really concentrated on world-class
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother, for instance, is a part of our
company, and he was a sous chef at the
[SPEAKER_00]: French Laundry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken some of that high-level
expertise and incorporated that into what
[SPEAKER_00]: we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day here in terms of developing new
food products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, we develop formulations for
brands globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our primary objective is to make these
foods absolutely delicious, but then to
[SPEAKER_00]: back that up with a really great
nutritional profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, some of these individuals
that have celiac disease and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: autoimmune diseases, they really are
lacking in certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really make a strong effort to bring
these things, incorporate them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: foods that we're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the bullet points here,
deliver nutrition without compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really sums it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we're really doing
that I think is important, this last
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet point, it's standardizing the
ingredients that are used in allergen-free
[SPEAKER_00]: baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about wheat flour, for instance,
wheat is highly standardized for protein
[SPEAKER_00]: content, quality of protein, damaged
starch levels, enzyme activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these characteristics that become very
important for a food producer to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce consistent products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, many gluten-free ingredients don't
enjoy that same level of standardization,
[SPEAKER_00]: so NEPRA is really working on that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp definitely plays a role here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying to do is as we work
through the various extractions of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, we look at what we can do to
standardize that ingredient so that other
[SPEAKER_00]: food producers know exactly how to use it
and what forms of the protein they should
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the nutrition is outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim will speak to that in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my standpoint, it's the absolute
versatility of the ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that picture on the side here,
we've got a few different items.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in the middle is a hemp heart flour
that we produce internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got toasted hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the hemp seed oil in the very back
and on the left is actually a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: margarine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of different components within the
seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a pretty significant
amount of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the shell has come off, then you've
got a hemp heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart itself is about 50% oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 34% protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got smaller fractions of
starch and fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a really great ash
content, lots of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that once you get
the oil out of the way, once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted the oil, and how you extract it
too is very important, you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you're not damaging the protein
during the oil extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of protein producers will use a
screw press with the hole on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some negatives to doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the high pressures involved in those
systems denature the hemp protein to an
[SPEAKER_00]: extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get tannins and chlorophyll and
some other things that penetrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those become very difficult to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the proteins that you see in
those types of systems are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are slightly bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very limited functionality in
terms of structure building properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a consequence, they don't tend to be
very usable in food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've really done is identify the
best ways to extract the protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance its functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing basically is de-holing
the seed first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going through a solvent-based,
we're going through a pressing stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: liquefying the hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going through a separation
process, being highly cognizant of the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein's functionality and trying to
preserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result is a protein that is white
in color, slightly sweet and nutty,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has this amazing functionality very
similar to whole eggs, which is incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's that level of functionality
that will allow for all the foods that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've centered on bakery items,
but we've got a few others in there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's white in color, obviously
there's no negative impact to a bakery
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not turning my breads green,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very palatable flavor, when I say
sweet and nutty, I mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a subtle sweetness to the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nutty and it's quite pleasant just by
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that really lends itself well to
formulation because you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover over any odd flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with plant-based proteins across
the board, potato protein, canola protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of which taste terrible but have
great functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about pea protein, limited
functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a decent gel but doesn't have a
lot of other properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be somewhat chalky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soy obviously has some problems in that it
carries the allergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As hemp relates back to each one of these,
in my opinion, it is the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we talk about the hemp industry,
and where it's going, it is my humble
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion that hemp protein and hemp foods
will be the first multi-billion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that some of these images and some
of this conversation really illustrate why
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, or why I think that will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in these pictures we've got on the
left here, we've got a textured hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that we've manufactured.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is high-pressure extrusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just hemp by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you extrude the hemp, you can see
that it forms these really nice textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this is wet again, those textures are
very reminiscent of chicken structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: like chicken protein structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, interestingly, fundamentally in hemp
you've got an amazing amino complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That amino complex is very high in
glutamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glutamine, as we know, is the primary
amino acid responsible for umami flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the hemp, when we extrude it,
it sounds like popcorn in the factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
but it smells like turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most bizarre thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you rehydrate this protein,
the natural flavor is meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't identify what it is,
but you want to call it a poultry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting from that
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of leads into the next slide
where we've made a mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mayonnaise is really just hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hemp protein with a clarified hemp
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually remove the gums and waxes from
the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we create internally an
enzyme-hydrolyzed hemp amino.
[SPEAKER_00]: That liquid amino, we standardize at 12%
saline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can dilute it down to about 6%,
and it'll still be stable at room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That amino liquid, the umami flavor is
absolutely outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mayonnaise, we add a little bit of
that hydrolyzed hemp amino liquid back in
[SPEAKER_00]: for some umami flavor, but then also to
satisfy the need for the salt in the
[SPEAKER_00]: formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we add a little bit of vinegar and
lemon juice just to bring the acidity down
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is a product that tastes just
like Hellman's mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture also has our gluten-free
bread featured.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bread, we use the hemp protein as the
primary egg replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in gluten-free baking,
we don't have gluten, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We end up usually using eggs for the
protein structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, because it replaces eggs in
literally every bakery formula that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it in, it does an amazing job of
helping create this backbone and this
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further comment here that I think is very
cool and important to bakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Egg whites, if I were to use egg whites in
this formulation for our bread,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I should back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a gluten-free bread technology
that we've developed that uses some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary starches and some of our other
ingredients, but then it also uses our
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp protein egg replacers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to make that formulation with
egg whites, that product would only get
[SPEAKER_00]: about 21 days of ambient shelf life,
stay soft and flexible, but the egg whites
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a drying effect on the crumb
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using hemp protein, I'm able to get an
additional 10 days of shelf life out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product, primarily because of the
globular nature of the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp protein is roughly 65% globulin,
a specific globular protein called
[SPEAKER_00]: adestin, and 35% albumin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The albumins and the globulins are both
highly soluble in combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The albumin is fully soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The globulins to about 70% give or take,
but because the globular proteins are so
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient at binding water, that moisture
is bound up in the product for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things that we're finding
is that the protein structures actually
[SPEAKER_00]: help encapsulate some of the starches and
prevent retrogradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide over, the next picture is a
hemp milk that we've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I wanted to illustrate here was
the foam that can be created through
[SPEAKER_00]: steaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make a hemp milk, not only is it
incredibly neutral in its flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very dairy reminiscent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, we've got some
versions that have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: residual oil in them as well, and they
have a wonderful creamy flavor that is
[SPEAKER_00]: just again, very dairy-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp oil, the specific oils in hemp,
it's a very low molecular weight oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small molecule and similar to
dairy fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's kind of a creamy effect
there that you get that's really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving over, those pretzels, what we
wanted to kind of demonstrate there was
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact of the amino acids in the hemp
on the Maillard reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I make gluten-free products,
obviously what I'm trying to do is emulate
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat-based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the consumer, the person eating
this to really feel like they're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: true, a real piece of bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Maillard reaction is obviously
a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just very interesting that the
specific amino complex in hemp ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: creating very similar flavors and colors
as to what you would see in a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat-based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of illustrate that further,
I got this next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was producing these pretzels on a line
in Indiana and Plymouth, Indiana,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were running gluten-based pretzels
on one line and gluten-free pretzels on a
[SPEAKER_00]: line in the next room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grabbed some of the gluten-based
pretzels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the top three you see in my hand
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I'm not wearing gloves in the
factory, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom three are gluten-free and with
the addition of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason we were adding hemp in
this formula specifically was to
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalize on its pseudo emulsification
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That prior slide that I should have
mentioned this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back just very quickly to mention
this, this mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down below, I got this little caption.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 grams of hemp protein is emulsifying,
in this case, 300 grams of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pseudo emulsification properties of
the hemp are quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this particular formula,
we were looking to replace lecithin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to get the sunflower lecithin
out and we wanted to try to use hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started at around two bakers
percent, which is about one and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: percent true in this type of formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got good results there,
but we wanted to see how little we could
[SPEAKER_00]: add and get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started taking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that with only a half a percent
addition of hemp to that formula that we
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up with a Maillard reaction that was
almost identical to wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a flavor impact, even at that
smallest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide kind of speaking to some of
the functionality, we test and play with
[SPEAKER_00]: all different types of hemp extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've played with all different types
of solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We favor, obviously, the clean solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going down the road of organic
ethanol extraction with a
[SPEAKER_00]: refunctionalization step right behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solvents do denature the protein
slightly as you extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as they have not been heat
denatured, they can be refunctionalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we go through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also played with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: My discovery there has been that the high
pressures associated with liquefying the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 actually have a damaging effect on the
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a little bit less of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those types of processes, that process
in particular, yields a very bright white
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutritively, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, I want less functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really kind of favor those types
of extractions for formulas where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to build in nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't necessarily want those
egg-like structures to overpower the
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a pretzel, for instance,
where I want the starches to really be the
[SPEAKER_00]: focal point for mouthfeel and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: In low pressure extrusion systems like
that, crackers and pretzels, too high of a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein content can lead to a rather hard
bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm trying to balance these factors
and effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a protein specific for that,
where you're seeing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein denaturing, I think, is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These images here, we're really just
testing the foaming capacity of the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're testing the gel strength after we've
baked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're performing a hydration
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these little tests that
we'll perform internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got various pieces of equipment,
too, that will really kind of aid and
[SPEAKER_00]: assist in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
we're looking for consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pictures, all bread, obviously,
all of these formulations utilize hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all gluten free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all utilize the hemp primarily as
the egg replacer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got lots of partner brands that
are going to be releasing products into
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace this year and going into
next year that contain hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really exciting is that you are
going to be seeing at shelf multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: products with hemp in the very,
very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a cascading effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we introduce these ingredients,
these variations of hemp protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: to specific manufacturers, they are
finding that it is solving problems for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the enhancement to shelf life
in the bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's others as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, too, I can mention a little
bit about relative ratios of hemp and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you add in for those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's got questions about that,
you can certainly put it in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll kind of talk through it a little
bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that in most formulations for
bread, I don't like to go over about 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp because it just ends up being too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The globular protein coagulates at around
170 degrees, so higher than egg would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is good in gluten free
formulations, truly, because I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: additional volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until the point that it sets,
we do get good expansion in the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once the protein, at higher
concentrations, once that protein starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to coagulate, you do see a slight
reduction in volume as the proteins kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of aggregate and collapse a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, we have done just about
every type of bakery product you can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tortilla chips are actually mostly
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing is we nixtamalize the
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're putting in giant steep tanks with
calcium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much starch in the hemp to
swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do swell a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those relative percentages, about 5%
starch, 5% fiber, give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see some swelling of the starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does form a dough when we subject
it to the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're using calcium
hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting thing is that it
tends to, well, you get a good amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: rheology in the dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get this really nice flavor
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very cool process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chips end up tasting very similar to
corn chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get the corn flavor,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very sweet and nutty and very
neutral in their flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here on the right, you see a band
full of low pressure extruded pretzels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being cut with the guillotine on
the inside of the cage there and laying
[SPEAKER_00]: down on the belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: These actual pretzels, you'll see in a bag
with one of our partners here in a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of minutes, one of the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited because, again,
we're seeing hemp really make its way into
[SPEAKER_00]: common foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to necessarily call it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a functional ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're using it primarily for these
specific structural purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foam stability, this is obviously a
meringue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, it's a pavlova.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we keep it a little bit soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an underbaked meringue, I guess you
could call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the meringue on the whisk
there, you notice it's not as stiff as egg
[SPEAKER_00]: whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that really speaks to the
higher level of globulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sags a little bit, as we would
say in the bakery industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the pictures on the top right,
you see that I've kind of piped it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used a star tip to illustrate
that it kind of just melts in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really hold the peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baking, that star pattern has kind of
disappeared entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the bottom right
picture, you can see the structure on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This formulation is literally just hemp
protein, water, and sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pavlova taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They function for all intents and
purposes, identically to their egg
[SPEAKER_00]: counterpart, just without the allergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're heavily into pastas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually looking at bringing these
products to market, potentially under our
[SPEAKER_00]: own brand, Future Endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've come up with a really special
formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the left, we've got kind of a
chow mein, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The noodles are hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This formulation of hemp pasta is 30 grams
of protein per serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on 100-gram dry bases, you boil that
100 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes 220 grams, which is essentially
a full bowl of pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: That serving, 100 grams, is 30 grams of
protein, only 30 net carbs, and 20 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of prebiotic fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the same al dente chew as a regular
wheat-based pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is partially due to the hemp
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: That globular protein, once it's cooked,
gives you this amazing chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bite is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that same chew or that bite is
communicated through what looks to be pork
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of that chow mein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually more hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our textured hemp protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we did flavor it to taste
more like pork.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what we were going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The center picture is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a chicken crumble-like enchilada
with actual hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got hemp cheese on it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the tortilla itself, we made that
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meatballs that you see there,
those are lamb-flavored, lamb and
[SPEAKER_00]: beef-flavored, but they are all hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back to the fact that when
you texturize the hemp, it forms these
[SPEAKER_00]: really wonderful textures reminiscent of
meat structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pair the hemp sometimes with other
proteins to achieve various results.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, with the meatballs,
we paired it with pea protein where we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted a little bit more of a firm bite,
less chicken-like, more beef-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of speaks, again, to the
versatility of hemp, being able to stack
[SPEAKER_00]: it with other proteins to achieve various
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, we have a picture of our
ravioli.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shell of the ravioli is, again,
our hemp pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the inside there, we've got our
hemp ricotta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the glutamine levels in
hemp, they sit at about 19% of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: amino complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dairy proteins are like 21% glutamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a lot of crossover flavor
with dairy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treated in the right way, you can create
hemp-based dairy alternatives that are on
[SPEAKER_00]: par flavor-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: With dairy, really great levels of
functionality, as I demonstrated before
[SPEAKER_00]: with that foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a barista at Starbucks got our hemp
milk, you would be hard-pressed to tell it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't just dairy milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the foam is almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of keep going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a dinner here in our Colorado
location two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been here a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call it two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did an 11-course fine dining experience
entirely based on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single course was primarily hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the focus was hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this cucumber salad,
we've got a breaded hemp goat cheese,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote, goat cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture, though, and flavor came off
exactly like goat cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put sprouted hemp seeds on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shepherd's pie, the second one over,
we did what we called an inside-out
[SPEAKER_00]: shepherd's pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the meat, quote unquote,
meat on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was stuffed with mashed potatoes on
the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a Rion co-extruder,
a KN, to build these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we made a hemp demi-glace and
then put, of course, the carrots and peas
[SPEAKER_00]: around the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tagliatelle, again, it's that hemp
pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did shaved truffle with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a hemp cheese,
like a cremini hemp cheese, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: cream sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really, really amazing flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp lends itself well to desserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a little miniature pithive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pithive is basically a puff pastry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a hemp-based puff pastry,
gluten-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the inside, we did a frangipane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frangipane is normally made with
almonds and sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you bake like a paste.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I did a hemp frangipane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I toasted hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I combined them with sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made this particular pastry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the inside, it was really,
really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then aside from the cherry compote
there in the middle, there's a hemp-based
[SPEAKER_00]: chantilly on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, speaking to the
functionality of hemp, this one protein
[SPEAKER_00]: can emulsify and make a mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it can be whipped into a whipped cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it can also make a meringue at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I challenge you to find other
proteins, especially plant-based proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just speaking to the versatility,
it's quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the products that
we'll be seeing coming into the market
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what hemp is doing in every one of
these is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the breads, it's an egg
replacer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the pasta, it's a feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about a huge amount of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that hemp is specifically adding
to the bite as well as obviously carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: a large portion of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pasta eats so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what really rounds it out are those
beautiful textures that are reminiscent of
[SPEAKER_00]: a real pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's interesting too is
that most gluten-free pastas tend to fall
[SPEAKER_00]: apart in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't hold well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't retort well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's very cool about this pasta
is that you can parboil it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a restaurant setting, this is
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can parboil it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pre-portion it and hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can flash it to order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a restaurant could take it,
put it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they have a customer that
requests a gluten-free pasta, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: bring this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could just put it right into the
sauce, reheat, and then serve immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's so cool that a single
ingredient will have so many levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pretzels, you saw in the pretzel
band a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our other partner on the
right that's likewise released a pretzel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, the hemp is really
driving the nutritional profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the fact that we don't want
a lot of functionality in that hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want it to just have a neutral flavor
and color and then supply a great amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stacked various proteins into that
pretzel so that we could kind of increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall PD cas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp has, and Kim will speak to most of
this, but hemp has a PD cas of about 0.65.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many cases, we'll want to stack
other proteins in there to make up the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in aminos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I'll let Kim go from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll really just jump in and talk about
the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I already have questions for you
and I get to see you every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But kind of continuing on from this CPG
highlight, over the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_01]: protein is really king in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with making protein content
claims on the front of packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: the FDA requires that you calculate the
percent daily value and then put that on
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrition fact label on the back of
your package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question kind of all ties into
protein quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this protein percent daily value,
Chadwick alluded to PD cas, which stands
[SPEAKER_01]: for protein digestibility corrected amino
acid score.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's being corrected for is
really what still ties into this complete
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hemp is considered a complete protein
source, meaning that it contains all nine
[SPEAKER_01]: essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of 20 total amino acids,
nine of which have to be consumed from our
[SPEAKER_01]: diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And protein quality now is more than just
a number on the back of a package or on
[SPEAKER_01]: the front panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really taking two things into
account.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking into account the composition
of these essential amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: along with the bioavailability and this
digestibility score that is determined on
[SPEAKER_01]: how well we're able to actually break down
process and utilize these amino acids in
[SPEAKER_01]: our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for hemp, and Chadwick already alluded
to it a bit, so they're able to calculate
[SPEAKER_01]: this digestibility score.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a D-hold or a hemp heart,
it's around, and the scale is,
[SPEAKER_01]: the max you can get is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So D-hold, just regular hemp seeds is at
about 0.87.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hemp heart flour, hemp proteins
is around that 9.4 to 9.6 amount as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why does this matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important because the fact that not
all proteins are considered complete,
[SPEAKER_01]: animal-based sources typically are,
but plant proteins, it varies and it lends
[SPEAKER_01]: to this concept of protein stacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we combine different types of
plant proteins, not only from a functional
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, but also making sure that
we're getting all these essential amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: For hemp in particular, our limiting amino
acid is lysine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I like to think about a
limiting amino acid, because that's also
[SPEAKER_01]: what's getting corrected in this
digestibility score to determine your
[SPEAKER_01]: percent daily value, is kind of like a car
analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have 20 tires, five motors,
four windshields, but if you only have one
[SPEAKER_01]: steering wheel, production ceases after
that one car is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not ingesting enough of the
essential amino acids, the building blocks
[SPEAKER_01]: for protein really cease before they even
begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continuing on, Chavak has already
mentioned this adestin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adestin is the globular seed storage
protein inherent to hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really unique and special to hemp
in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about 65%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The remaining would be that albumin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the globular form, and Chavak
mentioned that there's some around 70%
[SPEAKER_01]: solubility, along with this fact that it
closely mimics the serum globulins already
[SPEAKER_01]: in our blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this resemblance upon ingesting makes
it easier for a body to actually break
[SPEAKER_01]: down, and therefore views it to be
significantly lower risk of an allergen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, as of January 2025, sesame is now
the ninth top allergen per the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really limits some of these
allergen-free and gluten-free options when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to create a nutrient-dense,
delicious food product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the globular nature of the protein is
beneficial on many different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a picture here on the
right, which is our cold-pressed hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: heart oil that we make at our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it's a beautiful kind of
golden-yellow color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp oil is a polyunsaturated fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So due to some of the double bonds
throughout the molecule, it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more susceptible to oxidation and
rancidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of that fat content, about 70% of that
is omegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really wonderful that a
plant-based product is able to contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: this much omega to the overall kind of
diet from a whole food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even better, it has the optimal ratio
of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that ratio ideally would be one part
omega-3 to around six part omega-6s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, in the Western diet,
it's been getting pretty well-known for
[SPEAKER_01]: having elevated omega-6 levels,
which tip your body more into a
[SPEAKER_01]: pro-inflammatory state versus when you
consume that ideal ratio of omega-3 is
[SPEAKER_01]: into a more, not necessarily
anti-inflammatory, but it's keeping that
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation at bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other seed oils and like
sunflower oil, for example, have about 14
[SPEAKER_01]: parts omega-6 to one part omega-3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether or not, not saying that it's
bad, but it does tip you into that
[SPEAKER_01]: pro-inflammatory kind of reaction because
when you're eating anything with omegas,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're only really able to convert 16 to
20% different than an animal source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for this situation, you really want to
make sure that you're kind of stacking
[SPEAKER_01]: those omega-3s so that you're able to keep
your body in a less inflamed state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just due to that sensitive nature
of the oil, the smoke point is around 320
[SPEAKER_01]: to 330 degrees Fahrenheit and making it
more of a culinary-based oil than
[SPEAKER_01]: something you'd want to cook with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is one of our favorite
graphics that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name of the pasta that we had
developed previously was called pro-pasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love this graph because it shows a
great example of protein stacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our hemp protein pasta, there's also
pea protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's comparing 100 grams of dried pasta
to 100 grams of chicken breast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just see this amino acid
composition in general is pretty balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are ways that you can create a
plant-based product that is comparable to
[SPEAKER_01]: an animal source, highlighting that
glutamic acid and the glutamine for the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor and umami that Chadwick mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the alanine is really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in lieu of time, we'll just skip to
the next slide as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then real quick, just trends and
claims that are typical now in the food
[SPEAKER_01]: and CPG, kosher halal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually consumers tend to view a product
that's kosher to inherently be more
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not that's true is regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keto, low carb, seed oil-free,
vegan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the topics that is near and
dear to us is this contamination on the
[SPEAKER_01]: field for gluten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our line of work, we're always
trying to be very mindful of the parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million of the hemp that we're receiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically it's getting
cross-contaminated or the field is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: rotated with rye, wheat, and barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just being very aware as a grower and a
farmer of hemp that we here at Nefra and
[SPEAKER_01]: other food companies really value a
gluten-free source or happy to walk
[SPEAKER_01]: through and talk about how we might be
able to collaborate on something like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which lends to our kind of call to action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would love for you to continue
supporting brands that are using hemp in
[SPEAKER_01]: the marketplace, some of which we were
featured today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate others about the benefits of
industrial hemp, both functionally and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this last one of research roles
focused on hemp seed genetics is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is also really important for us
because not only is there opportunities to
[SPEAKER_01]: create hemp genetics that maybe are higher
in protein, but also kind of highlighting
[SPEAKER_01]: some other varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chuck, do you have anything to add
about the genetic component?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think crop yield is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done so much genetic work around
cannabinoids and so much work around fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: and some great fiber varietals out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all only produce around 12 to
1700 pounds of grain per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need varietals that are
producing, that are pushing the limit and
[SPEAKER_00]: producing closer to like 3,200 to 4,000
pounds of grain per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that at those levels,
we would really see the economics begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously we're very interested in
that, but we're interested in working with
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that have these capabilities to
really start pushing what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need food varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to improve on the size of the seed
if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get larger size, more consistent
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly even playing with protein ratios
in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we can get higher levels of
protein, offsetting the oil perhaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then the yields of protein will
be higher and the economics come down
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things we didn't
really talk about is the price of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to other proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pea protein, for instance,
is, you know, we'll talk about soy because
[SPEAKER_00]: soy is subsidized, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of artificially low price,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got huge factories built
for soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really see that with the other
plant-based proteins except for pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pea is really, you know, mass produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pea protein is about $3.50 to $3.75 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need hemp to be on the same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really kind of how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it through genetics and we do it
through agricultural processes that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prone or capable of yielding
higher levels or higher amounts of grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we'll talk, of course, I talk too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have very many questions we
can answer at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's see, we got the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have 14 questions right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question is, since it's
gluten-free, does it rise like bread and
wheat?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does because of its, you know,
similarity to the functionality of eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pre-whip it and you could add it
into a batter-based formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could get, you know, some pretty
great volume that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically speaking, no, it just,
it forms a rigid structure within the
[SPEAKER_00]: bread, kind of bolstering and holding up
the, you know, the starches as they cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think about starches, they gel
anywhere between 165 and 175 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're completely gelled by around 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they come out, as the bread comes out
of the oven, it's really quite soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, because there's no gluten in a
gluten-free bread, you're lacking the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that protein structure sets in a rigid
form and it prevents the starches from
[SPEAKER_00]: collapsing back on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really the benefit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you experimented with hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a bulk ferment process similar to
sourdough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor results are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely, I would definitely try
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a mild flavored protein, it suits
itself very well, but there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting flavors that are developed in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would definitely try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really pleasant sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found that any, that some
industrial hemp seed varietals are better
[SPEAKER_00]: than others?
You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to play mostly with fanola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our Canadian partners are
producing X-59.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've gotten carmignola.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten a few others that are,
they all seem to be fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, this is again,
I think a huge body of work that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we start identifying, you know,
all of these strains, which ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the way, they might not be hemp
strains that have the best levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen some marijuana strains that
the seeds have incredible functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of future work could really
be done around hybridizing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, first of all, isolating the
proteins, making a judgment around
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality, chasing down which
attributes might be the best for food
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hybridizing, you know,
to get the appropriate genetics in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field for these purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next question, how much time does it take
for you guys to create formulations for
[SPEAKER_00]: other companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dependent on the formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have thousands of formulas in whole,
just waiting for somebody to ask us for
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes those formulations will be,
you know, turned around very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average time, I would say is probably,
you know, three to six months to really go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to include scale up in a
factory, and those types of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's additional time that's tacked onto
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just a, it's a matter of
going back and forth and making sure that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the customer is happy with the
formulation first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes into consumer testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a lot of the tweaking is
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course there's final tweaking
done at the factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so what hemp seed characteristics
would I like hemp breeders to focus on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of said some of this already,
but I'm, protein content, protein quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed size, yield per acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, I think the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested in the oil too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to discount the oil at all,
but you know, we use a lot less of the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: than we do of the protein for our specific
purposes.
So,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this question, did you say that the
hemp flowers derived from the hemp hearts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not boiled and separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to cook the protein or else
it's denatured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to gently separate the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put them in a, we run it through a
colloidal mill, basically, our shear
[SPEAKER_00]: mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, you know, create essentially
a wet puree of hemp solids and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course that oil starts to
separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use enzymes to further get
out, release the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, these are all done at lower
temperatures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're trying to maintain the
functionality of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a very gentle process that
we're going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what's important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to treat the protein appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separating the adestin and albumin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't really go through that
separation, but we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albumin is water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adestin is salt soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually extract the,
you can get the adestin to bind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the albumin will stay,
it'll precipitate out at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can separate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The albumin stays in the water and then
you can go through a drying process for
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the simple, that's the simple
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more complicated than that,
but salt precipitation is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the omega three to six ratio?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got three parts LA to one part ALA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I manufacture the hemp oil and protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make the hemp feed for laying hens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not really delved into animal
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not very well equipped to answer
that question, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got some friends in the San Luis
Valley here in Colorado that are doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are making feed for hens and they're
growing varietals of fanula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then we've got a company here in
Colorado, New West Genetics, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced a new strain into the
marketplace called Amplify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen lots of farmers in the state
trying to play with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just, you know,
trying to identify new varietals is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, too, for the latitudes where
these products are being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I, this question is good because I
mentioned 4,000 pounds of grain per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is for the whole grain,
whole on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming that once we de-hull it,
you know, we're losing about 40 to 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see a larger seed size so that
that ratio goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting larger hearts in relation
to the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I expect, you know, based on
that, then we're looking at about,
[SPEAKER_00]: once we've taken the oil out, which is
again, 50% of the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you're losing 40 to 50% of
the hull off the top, the weight there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're taking half of the heart
is oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're only left with about 34% protein
at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the ratios that I'd like to
see increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: More protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question is around, the egg market
and the avian flu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are we seeing ingredient demand appear
for egg replacement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is the short answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we know that hemp will do
this effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can modify.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ultrasonic, you know,
cross-linking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other processes for cross-linking,
you know, proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can fully solubilize the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really cool things that
you can do with it to enhance the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality and make it better for egg
replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have not really concentrated very
much on this, but we have played a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit around actual egg replacement for home
cooks, being able to form a liquid similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to like just eggs formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use, of course, mung bean protein
that's been hydrolyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have played a little bit with hemp
proteins in this regard, and we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really great textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft, creamy gels that have a very,
very pleasant flavor at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: without any flavor additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest cooking temperature for powder
and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the oil, I'd be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not deep fry in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To cook with it is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to stay within that, you know,
stay below the smoke point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that smoke point is around 320 to
330 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that, you know,
it stays below that or else you start
[SPEAKER_00]: damaging the omegas, and that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the protein itself coagulates around
170 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say that there's a high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd just be concerned about burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of baked goods in the oven,
you know, they'd get a little too dark if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see a question around working with
NIHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we are not currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have lots of projects with,
you know, official capacities that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: following up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, we're really trying to
drive the hemp industry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to see the greater industry
come into its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want grain at good prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today's prices make it very difficult
to get the protein extracted in an
[SPEAKER_00]: economical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have to be highly cognizant as
a product developer of what the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: price of, you know, the consumer price of
these finished goods is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a protein is too expensive,
I just simply can't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not to the degree that I would
like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every ingredient that you use has its own
relative percentage with which it's used
[SPEAKER_00]: in a formulation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with hemp, I like it to be around
that 30% value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes all the way down to like,
you know, half a percent, as I showed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the example, using it to improve the
Maillard reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if I have a formulation
where it demands 30% hemp, I can't put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there if it's 15 bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if I can get it down closer
to the price of pea protein, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for this amazing
talk and for answering all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wrapping up for today's webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been recorded and we will upload it
to our School of Integrative Plant Science
[SPEAKER_02]: SIPs YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish all of you a great rest of the
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
