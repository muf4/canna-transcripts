[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, when I was organizing the
seminar program for the fall, I was very
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous about having a lot of gaps that I
wouldn't be able to fill with speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And happily, we've filled them all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, initially, my plan was,
if I had to, I would give one seminar on
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava and a second one on maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're really lucky because you filled
them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've arranged that the seminar on
cassava is going to be a joint or shared
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar between myself and my senior
research associate, Peter Hyde,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is going to give you most of the
actual data and results from our next-gen
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just give you a little bit
of a lead-in and give you some context on
[SPEAKER_00]: the project as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Peter is going to show you most
of the work on cassava flowering that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done in pursuit of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next-gen cassava project is a large
project funded by the Bill and Melinda
[SPEAKER_00]: Gates Foundation and by US or UK aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, as you can see on this slide,
a number of institutions that participate,
[SPEAKER_00]: our participants in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The project is led and managed by Cornell
University out of international programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ronnie Kaufman, as the head of IP
CALS, is the principal investigator on
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lead project is a breeding project
for cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that the lead,
technical lead, is Jean-Luc Janink on that
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these other participants who
are on the project doing breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mainly our target is in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have International Institute of
Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Program for Cassava Breeding,
which is located in Umugike, Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the national programs in
Uganda and in Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: as participants in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project has been underway for
approximately five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just made the transition from
phase one to phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phase two, as we've sort of gone
along, we've picked up contributions from
[SPEAKER_00]: two other important places in the world
where cassava breeding is taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The International Center for Tropical
Agriculture in Colombia and the EMBRAFA in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also even some participation
by folks in Hawaii for germplasm transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: from Latin America to Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project involves quite a lot of
participation by groups throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do our best to become a coordinated
project among all the team members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the places that we work correspond to
the largest production areas in Africa for
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this map shows you the area harvested
in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that Nigeria is a lot of
cassava production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it is the largest producer of
cassava in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Africa in general represents about 55%
of the total production of cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our focus is to work with
breeding programs in West Africa and then
[SPEAKER_00]: these two programs, Uganda and Tanzania in
East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of cassava production,
particularly in Thailand and in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand has an excellent breeding program
and they're a bit more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our work is in coordination with the
programs in Africa where we could really
[SPEAKER_00]: make some progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: By improving their programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava has a number of attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why cassava?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons is that in fact,
in the world, the amount of production has
[SPEAKER_00]: increased quite a lot in recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trend is that the rate of increase is
somewhere between the rate of increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: rice and in maize production, much higher
than the rate of increase in production of
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's been a lot of recognition
in recent years about the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava as being a important crop for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And producers are increasing the
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a highly productive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's particularly suited for tropical
conditions where it can bridge between the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and wet seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can utilize the land for long
periods of time during the year and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to be productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the reputation for being able to
tolerate stresses and in some way be a
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiving crop for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to say, in low nutrient or mineral
nutrient conditions, it can still grow
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonably well and provide a good
production and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can grow in drought-prone soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go to climates in some parts of
the world that are becoming warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is able to tolerate, in fact,
it thrives in the warmer temperature that
[SPEAKER_00]: our experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has potential for becoming even more
important in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that sense, we could say that it's
a food security, a good food security
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is producing a starchy root that
has many different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you have the ability to
produce cassava, it can be used for home
[SPEAKER_00]: use, and culinary uses at home,
various types of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also can be used to provide a
product that can be sold for other
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a more purified form of
starch, tapioca, can be used for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different food manufacturing uses,
even industrial uses, as they do in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very versatile crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of challenges in cassava
production, and that's why we need the
[SPEAKER_00]: NextGen Cassava Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that it's not reaching full yield
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, it's been recognized
as a crop that has a lot of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacles, difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is that it is a crop that,
in order to obtain sufficient clones that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be tested in uniform yield trials,
that are replicated at different
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, it takes quite a lot of years
to build up those numbers of propagules
[SPEAKER_00]: that are needed in order to do that kind
of good trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, the breeding cycle
typically takes something like eight years
[SPEAKER_00]: or more between one set of crossing events
and the next one that would be based on
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic information collected from the
first row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's rather been slower to make
improvements, and because of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we feel that there's a lot of untapped
potential, and what we need is better
[SPEAKER_00]: methods of breeding that will address the,
be able to make more rapid progress,
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nutritional limitations in that
it's pure starch, but it has very little
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are efforts that have been
successful in introducing higher
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-vitamin A content, and there are other
nutritional characteristics that are part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the overall strategy for cassava
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some, it is susceptible to
several viral and bacterial diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: are fairly serious threats, particularly
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Africa, the cassava mosaic
disease, CMD, is a very serious problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have resistance but it needs to be
incorporated into breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cassava brown streak is a disease that
is expanding from the east towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: west, and currently it is a serious
problem in Tanzania and in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fear is that it will spread further
into West Africa, the largest cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: producing area in the world, and will
devastate production if we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared with resistance ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another of the breeding targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project that Cornell leads is a
project that uses a relatively new
[SPEAKER_00]: approach towards breeding, and that's
called genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genomic selection has the potential to
accelerate cassava breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's led by, and this is a diagram from a
seminal article written by Hefner,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Sorrell, and John Luke Janink here at
Cornell, and it laid out the advantages of
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection over conventional and
other breeding approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conventional cassava breeding,
as I mentioned a little while ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: involves the clonal propagation of the
lines, and in order to have sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: propagules to do a proper, accurate,
multi-location replicated trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes a long time and it slows down
the whole advance or improvement process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomic selection tries to use a different
strategy that will accelerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do is we still have the
need for high-quality phenotyping,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's done on a subset of the
population, a training population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this training population is going
to be a subset which will represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding population as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be an ongoing process of
improving our knowledge of this training
[SPEAKER_00]: set, a training set that in fact involves
some changes in the composition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's then coupled with that is that the
training lines are genotyped using DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis at markers that span throughout
the genome, and it allows the preparation
[SPEAKER_00]: of a statistical model for estimating the
breeding value of each individual based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotypic information in the training
cycle and the genotypic information from
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the program has a model that will
be able to predict the potential breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: value of any individual that is produced
through recombination and predict it based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the model as opposed to actual field
trials of that particular line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that in the process of
line development, after a cross is made
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plants begin to grow, even at the
seedling stage at very young plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: before we can have any estimate of yield,
we can take a sampling of the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: do the genotypic marker analysis using DNA
methodology, use the model to predict what
[SPEAKER_00]: its breeding value is, and then make
decisions on which lines to use as parents
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next round based on that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go much more quickly, and it is
actually with the low cost of sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be cheaper actually than doing the
phenotyping the old way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process then involves accelerating
the rate at which this cycle goes between
[SPEAKER_00]: successive crosses and the recombination
that's needed and associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that cassava has
another characteristic that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacle, and that is its four flowering
characteristics, and that's what Peter and
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're gonna tell you about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an illustration of the type of
problem we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a survey of over 1,800 clones
assessed in Ubi-Aja, Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Ubi-Aja is the very best location for
getting good flowering in Nigeria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is the location that the IITA
Institute is using as their location for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, in Ubi-Aja, in this set of
1,800 lines, we look at the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: ability going from zero, which means no
flowering at all, to three, which is good
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only around 33% or so were good flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two-thirds were either medium or
low flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, 15 or 18% were no flowering at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that a lot of the
favorable alleles that you might wish to
[SPEAKER_00]: use in order to improve the cassava are
locked up in lines that you really have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of difficulty crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by finding ways to obtain better
flowering, we have the potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: unlocking those germplasm that could be
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is that cassava is late
flowering, takes a long time to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, maybe four to nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some lines, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not flower within the one-year
time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering among parents that you want to
cross is often not synchronous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just at the mercy of whatever the
flowering behavior is, and if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: non-synchronous, that creates a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big obstacle to making the process of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a low number of flowers produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one thing is the induction of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is the quantity or number of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The low percentage of those flowers that
are produced are female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter will tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there's a lot of abortion or
arrested development of the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruits, and the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, each flower will potentially
produce only three seeds, and oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: one or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of one or all of those three seeds
do not develop because of the arrested
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of our project is to develop a
set of tools and tools that we will define
[SPEAKER_00]: as Peter will describe the type of work
that we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A set of tools that breeders can use
conveniently in their nurseries to hasten
[SPEAKER_00]: flower induction and to increase
prolificacy in their seedling nurseries
[SPEAKER_00]: and crossing blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been really pleased with the
very great amount of progress that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to make in developing a set of
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now in the conclusion of phase
one where we have developed tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to just enter phase two
where we put more of our emphasis on
[SPEAKER_00]: working with breeding programs to
implement them in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to this slide here, I just showed
you again the participation of each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these institutions, and we have
representatives at each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions who work with us on the
flowering program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do work under controlled conditions
like greenhouse and growth chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we depend on them primarily to do
the field studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cornell, Peter and I are going to be
telling you about the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah Adeyomo just finished a postdoc
earlier this year, and there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of information we'll provide from her
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xiang Guan, you may remember, she finished
a master's degree about one year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Deborah Adey is a PhD student with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, she's located at IITA and
working on the program as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the last of my slides,
and this is where I pass the baton over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sound all right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to share some of the work that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find this project really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be beneficial in the
long run, and it's been a really fun five
[SPEAKER_05]: years of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to start out by showing some
pictures and just giving a little
[SPEAKER_05]: background on what cassava flowers are
like, because I'm going to be showing you
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of data and make sure that it's
understandable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cassava, this is a cassava inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Producing a few female flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are open female flowers,
and usually about 10% of all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers are female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second come the males.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are unopened male flowers at this
point, and they flower at a forking event.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the apical meristem grows, and then it
branches.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two forked branches, and at that
point, they flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The illustration here is our cassava
field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what some grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: They fork.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow up again a little bit further,
and they flower again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call this the first-tier flowering,
and then this is second-tier flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, you get better flower
development on the second, third,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe fourth tier, and then it starts to
taper off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you get very little development of
flowers on the first tier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they grow like this,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get no flower development on any
of the tiers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say no development.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does grow at very, very small in
fluorescence, less than a centimeter,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then up-sizes and falls off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no open flowers, no possibility of
pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they also grow like this for a
very long time, and then fork.
[SPEAKER_05]: And other times, they just keep growing
and growing and growing, and you get no
[SPEAKER_05]: forking, no flower development.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually kind of interesting,
too, because this is a desired trait in
[SPEAKER_05]: some areas, which is like a breeder's
nightmare, breeding for a trait that makes
[SPEAKER_05]: it really hard to breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we, if we can
stimulate artificially a plant that grows
[SPEAKER_05]: like this to flower, but then in the
field, in growers' fields, it will still
[SPEAKER_05]: be growing like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this variability is seen across
genotypes and environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might have one genotype that
flowers very well, another genotype that
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers very poorly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have a genotype that flowers
very well in one location, very poorly in
[SPEAKER_05]: another location.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is where we really first got
started, the environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two environmental factors that are
well known to regulate flower and
[SPEAKER_05]: influence flower development is
temperature and photo period in other
[SPEAKER_05]: crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these also interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm gonna get into some of our
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll explain this a little slower the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see this chart many times,
because this is how we represent the age
[SPEAKER_05]: of flowering or percentage flowering in
most of our work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the x-axis here is age and days,
and the y-axis is the percent forking.
[SPEAKER_05]: This does not mean that they produced a
large inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means they got to the point of
forking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times we're happy with that
at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have three different
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were grown in growth chambers here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we saw was at a very warm
temperature, 34 C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only about 22% actually got to the point
of forking.
[SPEAKER_05]: A more moderate 28, we saw 75% forking,
and this is a very cool temperature for
[SPEAKER_05]: cassava.
[SPEAKER_05]: 22, we saw 96% fork.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is at the first tier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second tier, we see a very similar
pattern.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really indicates the temperature is
critical to flowering or forking.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also saw that at the two lower
temperatures, there was an increase in
[SPEAKER_05]: floral development.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this graph here, is again, the days
after floral initiation, so after forking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is the number of flowers
that are present on the inflorescence over
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we see is that at 28,
you get some increase in floral
[SPEAKER_05]: development.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at 22, you get quite a bit more
floral development.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 34 is not on this, because those
never even forked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't show any data regarding the
number of flowers that were developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question you might have is,
so are the plants just really unhealthy at
[SPEAKER_05]: warm temperatures?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because 34 is pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, actually cassava here,
it grows very well at 34, vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at 22, it is much shorter,
but it's a healthy plant, and you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: the forking and flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing we wanted to look at was
photo period.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way we do our photo period
experiments is you have regular grow
[SPEAKER_05]: lights for maybe 10 hours, and then we do
a dim light extension.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use, that's not photosynthetic
radiation, so that they're more
[SPEAKER_05]: comparable.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used red lights, red LEDs, in fact,
because, look at this chart here,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the spectrum of the red LED.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is, the max is about 640,
which aligns better to the phytochrome,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the pigment that absorbs red
light and stimulates flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: The white LEDs you see are shifted away
from the spectrum that's more beneficial
[SPEAKER_05]: for flowering and for absorption by the
phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with long day extension, and this is,
at moderately cool temperature,
[SPEAKER_05]: 25, we saw that long days stimulates
earlier flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see here that at 10 hour day,
it's about 40%, and at a 14 hour day,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're up to about 80%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this data is representing four
different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the work we do, we have four
different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are late flowering or poor flowering,
and some are early flowering, and some are
[SPEAKER_05]: in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the means of all of those
combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then at warmer temperatures, so at 30
degrees Celsius, we see also a benefit of
[SPEAKER_05]: long day in terms of flowering,
that flowering, the percentage of
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering goes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not as pronounced as at the
cooler temperature, which goes along with
[SPEAKER_05]: the fact that the first experiments we did
with temperature showing that temperature
[SPEAKER_05]: inhibits flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we also wanted to look at more
interactions between photo period and
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was done, as opposed to a short
and long day, we wanted to look at more
[SPEAKER_05]: what field grown plants would be,
which would be 12 hours, and see if we,
[SPEAKER_05]: just by going from 12 up to 16,
you're also seeing a benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be more what's gonna happen in
the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And indeed we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, there's cool temperature and
warm temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the warm temperature of 30,
or 35 day, 30 night, we see no flower
[SPEAKER_05]: initiation at 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with long, with cool temperatures,
cool temperatures at 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_05]: we see some initiation of flowering,
and cool temperature at long day,
[SPEAKER_05]: even better flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm gonna step aside, and this is a
little bit, this is some work that Sarah
[SPEAKER_05]: Ediamo spearheaded looking at FT,
because it ties into the photo period.
[SPEAKER_05]: FT is a relatively new discovery that the
FT gene is responsible for flower
[SPEAKER_05]: induction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she identified two FT-like genes in
cassava.
[SPEAKER_05]: The model is that the photo period
stimulates long day, stimulates FT
[SPEAKER_05]: expression in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's transported via the phloem to the
apical meristem, or the flowering region,
[SPEAKER_05]: and stimulates flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is common in a lot of different
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we looked at the plants we were
growing in the photo, in the different
[SPEAKER_05]: photo periods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And indeed, one of the FT genes,
FT2, was expressed at a higher level under
[SPEAKER_05]: long days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's indicating that the FT is
responsible, or partially is responsible
[SPEAKER_05]: for the flowering, the improvement in
flowering that we're seeing under long
[SPEAKER_05]: day, under photo period experiments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in conclusion for the photo period and
temperature, we see that cooler
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures, hasten flowering,
and warm reduce flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long days also decrease the time to
flowering, and high temperature,
[SPEAKER_05]: will reduce or eliminate that long day
effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even with the long day, if it's very
hot, it will not flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the low wattage LEDs are effective for
stimulating flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is important when we get into
field work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to have more efficient lights
for a field.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing we wanted to look at was
plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have to study this in detail,
but I put this up here because often I
[SPEAKER_05]: explain to people that we use a few
compounds, and they say, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: how do you know that those particular
compounds were gonna work?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact of the matter is we had no
idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took a shotgun approach and tested lots
and lots of plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tested them here at Cornell,
and then our colleagues in Africa also
[SPEAKER_05]: worked on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And lots of different compounds,
different combinations, different
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found in the end that there was two
that are very important to flowering,
[SPEAKER_05]: cytokinins, and we're using the synthetic
DA, and then ethylene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're, I'll both show work with
ethylene with STS, which is silver
[SPEAKER_05]: thiosulfate, which blocks the ethylene
receptor and renders the plant insensitive
[SPEAKER_05]: to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then ethyphon, which is a compound
that's absorbed by the plant and quickly
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolized into ethylene, it reduces
flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So silver thiosulfate, like I said,
it blocks the ethylene receptor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's our water control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zoom in for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I mean by basically no
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's less than a centimeter long.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it's already turning straw
colored.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's upsizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna fall off in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with application, spray
application, application of silver
[SPEAKER_05]: thiosulfate, we see this enormous
inflorescence develop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's graphical representation of the
data we saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just one concentration.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tested a few different concentrations,
and we saw that with increased
[SPEAKER_05]: concentration, increased benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, this is water control,
and then going up to one millimolar,
[SPEAKER_05]: we got the best benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was great, but it didn't work very
well in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started testing a lot of different
ways to apply STS.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brainstormed a lot of different why
this wouldn't work in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the leaves developed a thicker wax
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the rain is just washing the STS
off, and it takes a long time to be
[SPEAKER_05]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried some different adjuvants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried rain sticker that helps the plant
basically glue your substance of choice
[SPEAKER_05]: onto the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: We increased the humidity of the leaves,
trying to keep the stomata open by putting
[SPEAKER_05]: bags over the tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them worked a little bit,
but what we really found works well is
[SPEAKER_05]: this application using petiole feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way this works is you can cut a
leaf off, and then there's negative
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you quickly cut the leaf off and
put it into a solution, it will take up
[SPEAKER_05]: that solution through the vascular bundle.
[SPEAKER_05]: STS is not red.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just to explain, and I was using
this as a tracer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it is absorbing the red liquid,
and then you can see the vascular bundles
[SPEAKER_05]: if you cut off that petiole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather quickly, a couple hours,
it will be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also cut this plant up quite a bit more
and saw that it mostly goes up in the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants to the apical region.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a pretty effective way of
applying STS.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we again tested a few different
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And saw that with increased concentration
up to a certain point, we see increased
[SPEAKER_05]: benefit in the floral development.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this one I need to slow down for a
little bit, because it's a little
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we wanted to make sure was that
STS was having effect on ethylene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just some strenuous factor of
silver being in the plant that is causing
[SPEAKER_05]: the flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have two different treatments over a
course of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at first, we started out by either
treating plants with water control or with
[SPEAKER_05]: silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these flowers were already developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is unlike what we were doing in
the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a high flowering genotype we used.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flowers were already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sprayed them with water, or we sprayed
them with STS.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we waited a little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of the water controls,
half of them we sprayed with Ethafon,
[SPEAKER_05]: and half of them we did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of the plants that we treated with
STS, also half of them we sprayed with
[SPEAKER_05]: Ethafon, and half of them we did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you look at the graph over here,
so we have plants not sprayed with STS,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they have a decent amount of flowers,
and then not sprayed with Ethafon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our water control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants sprayed with STS, and then without
Ethafon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, there's no real difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: STS does not negatively influence the
flowers, or positive, because these are
[SPEAKER_05]: already developed flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't spray with STS, so water,
and then we spray with Ethafon,
[SPEAKER_05]: it knocks all those flowers off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the course, this is about five days
in between these two treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we spray with STS,
and then we spray with Ethafon,
[SPEAKER_05]: the STS protects the plant from the
Ethafon response, and none of the flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: fall off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this makes it pretty clear to us that
the STS is affecting Ethafon, or ethylene
[SPEAKER_05]: in the plant, and it's an ethylene
response.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also said we worked with cytokinin,
BA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, showing you a lot of these
controls, no flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we saw that BA had a slight beneficial
effect on flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not as good as STS alone,
but it was not as good as STS,
[SPEAKER_05]: so initially we weren't that excited about
it, but we kept being intrigued.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then what we saw was that the
combination of STS and BA, there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: synergistic effect, and we get these very
large inflorescences develop.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're better than the STS, so this looks
really great for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is a graph with a representation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that the water control,
and then we have STS alone, BA alone,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then with the combination
multiplicative effect, and it's much
[SPEAKER_05]: greater than the sum of the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was wonderful, but it gets better.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't believe it, can you?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we go back to this picture of,
I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'm gonna point out to you is,
like I said earlier, typical flowering,
[SPEAKER_05]: you get a few females here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see this is actually fruit
developing, and then males up at the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I zoom in, oh, I went ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we see is that with STS alone,
you get males on the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a typical ratio, but with BA,
it's all females.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire inflorescence is a female.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have about 150 female flowers on
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a breeder who's trying to get seed,
this is actually very, very useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's some of the data that goes
along with this that we can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get a slight increase of BA and STS,
but then with the two, almost 100%
[SPEAKER_05]: females.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to look more into this,
and when do we need to apply this with BA
[SPEAKER_05]: to get this shift?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we did here was we have control,
and then the STS with no BA, and then BA
[SPEAKER_05]: 14 days before any visible flowering,
at flowering, and then 14 days after.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we see is you really have to get
that application BA on before you can even
[SPEAKER_05]: see any flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it indicates that the transition to
females happened very early in floral
[SPEAKER_05]: development.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you actually do see a benefit in
floral development applying at flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: or a little bit after flowering,
but you don't get the massive shift to
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly females.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in conclusion, for our plant growth
regulators, we see that foliar
[SPEAKER_05]: applications of STS can increase the
quantity of flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: STS protects the flower from ethylene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Applying through the petiole is effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Combination of BA and STS is much more
effective, and that BA increases the
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage of female flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the last topics I'm going to touch
on is pruning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pruning is people have done this a lot,
where you can manipulate source-sink
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships in plants by removing parts,
by cutting them off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our colleague in Columbia, Hernan
Ceballos, started doing a little work on
[SPEAKER_05]: this, and he mentioned it to us,
and we carried on with it also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we do is when the plant is very
young, so earlier than this stage,
[SPEAKER_05]: and these lateral fork branches are less
than a half a centimeter long,
[SPEAKER_05]: so very small.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three branches usually,
and then the inflorescence is also less
[SPEAKER_05]: than a half a centimeter long.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cut those branches off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get in there with a magnifying
glass and a scalpel and pop them off,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you get a nice inflorescence
develops.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: No plant growth regulator is needed,
and you get a huge inflorescence at the
[SPEAKER_05]: first tier, which the first tier normally
doesn't produce many flowers, even in a
[SPEAKER_05]: high flowering genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this can really push the time to
get flowers and to get seed quite a bit
[SPEAKER_05]: faster in breeding nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: We decided to take it one step further and
see if BA would have the same feminization
[SPEAKER_05]: effect that we saw with the SDS,
and it sure does.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get about 100% females.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the data showing that you get an
increase with both pruning and pruning in
[SPEAKER_05]: BA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next phase has come.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim mentioned is going to be, we've kind
of developed a toolbox and trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: disseminate this information out to
breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing some trips and trying to
develop red light setups so we can
[SPEAKER_05]: basically mimic long days in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: LEDs is really nice because they're low
energy, and these will probably be set up
[SPEAKER_05]: on solar systems, solar powered,
so they can be put in any field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Working with people like Simon Peter here
to do some PGR applications in the field
[SPEAKER_05]: and working with the folks like Smith,
who are actually, he leads all the
[SPEAKER_05]: crossing at IATA for the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not so much with the breeders,
but with the people that are actually
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the work, doing the crossing.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can they best utilize this information
and benefit their crossing the best?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in conclusion, just a few things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that long day is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool temperatures around 25 seem to be the
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of difficult to manipulate in
the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: SDS and BA are great for improving
flowering, and pruning also works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the challenges are the SDS in the
field.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't seen as good of benefit as we
have seen in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to work on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for phase two, really optimizing
these methods for the field, developing
[SPEAKER_05]: the best application for them,
assessing fruit and seed set in the field
[SPEAKER_05]: as they're doing the pollination,
making sure these methods work with
[SPEAKER_05]: crossing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Developing field scale, photo period,
extension, field testing of the pruning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Best combinations, because there's a lot
of different combinations you can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably doing some of the photo period
extension with the PGRs will have I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: guessing that's where we'll probably end
up going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And doing workshops that training people
how to use this technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all for paying attention,
and I find this really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you do too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to thank our partners and our
donors, because without them wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim and I can field any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, it's very exciting, even to a
soil scientist.
So my question is, and maybe I kind of
misunderstood the procedure, but Tim
[SPEAKER_01]: initially talked about using phenotyping
of a training set to kind of predict
certain properties in related to genotypic
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, you're manipulating the
phenotypical features Is that an issue in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the broader program, or do you do
the phenotyping much earlier on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phenotyping on the training set is
a set of clones representative of the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding population at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done without making any crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding program requires the crossing
in order to get recombination and
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable alleles brought in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is done on this right hand half of
that diagram, where you would wish to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that cycling as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genotypic selection allows you to
have a model that's developed to relate
[SPEAKER_00]: the performance, let's say the yield and
the marker that are marking and sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome, the sequence that's a single
nucleotide position with polymorphogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to model that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the progeny that are
produced at each turn of the cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do several thousand lines,
analyze them by DNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that DNA information,
you will be able to predict what their
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding values are, whether they would be
good parents to select in the next round
[SPEAKER_00]: of crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're needed for is to help take
young plants and get them to flower as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as possible and in numbers of
flowers as many as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when they have selected desirable
parents, they can make the desired crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: on a timely schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in some cases, there are
lines that they would like to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't flower at all under
conventional conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in different phases of the whole
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the question a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, aren't you going to harm the front
of farmers' yield potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're only working in the nursery with
these tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a breeder's toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers will not have an altered
flowering plant if all those, unless the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding selection resulted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in our case, it's likely that we
would be selecting for low flowering lines
[SPEAKER_00]: more so than under conventional
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't affect what the farmer will
have as a genotype that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is whether there has been
enough information collected to evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the process of genomic selection
and the model development is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not talk about that part of the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there have been a series of
seminars, primarily in the plant breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar program, where Jean-Luc and
Chadozzi Agise and others, and several
[SPEAKER_00]: students, PhD students, have gone through
the program and have also presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the answer to your question is that
yes, there's evidence that it is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it two-fold, 10-fold?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quantitative trait breeding for
yield, which is one of the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: targets, is a process that is going to
result in steady but relatively small
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking 1% to 10%, 1% to 5%
increase per cycle, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're encouraged to go to this
phase two, which we're just entering now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a very interesting result.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I wonder, so you have such a big
variation in terms of flowering between
[SPEAKER_03]: different cassava lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your data implies that, perhaps,
this variation is due to homogeneous
[SPEAKER_03]: ethylene level, like high flowering lines
have low ethylene and high cytogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you measured, have you done that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're asking, have we done the
analysis to show that in a plant that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not treating, does ethylene?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I wonder, so in the first slide when
Jim was showing, there are 33%,
[SPEAKER_03]: only 33% of cassava lines have high
flowering potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's quite a bit of variation in
terms of how much flowers are produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I wonder, whether this variation
between lines can be also due to this
[SPEAKER_03]: inherent ability of this line to produce
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, those lines which
consistently produce lots of flowers,
[SPEAKER_03]: they actually produce less ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's like a natural variation
between lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't measured ethylene
production across genotypes at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's foreseeable, could be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What little we have done, and this was
when Sean Guan was a master student.
[SPEAKER_00]: She finished a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she tried a few different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't that particular factor,
the ethylene, was not the key
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say that's not terribly surprising
because you have really in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling for both flower induction and
for flower set, quite a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that could be genetically different
between lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, at least in the lines that
she surveyed, very small, 419 and 0002,
[SPEAKER_00]: that wasn't the key thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, when we look at the FT
production, while the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the FT2 transcript levels
was showing very clear relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the genotype differences,
that transcript abundance alone wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: good predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, there's many other components
of a signaling pathway that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: different between lines that could be
responsible for the overall outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been our objective to do a
complete and thorough investigation of
[SPEAKER_00]: what causes these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been very much in the applied
science mode where we're looking for this
[SPEAKER_00]: toolbox, things that will work for the
readers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, as a physiologist, we have not been
given the responsibility to pursue
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular physiology in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a clonally propagated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's released as a clone,
then it will stay the same as long as it
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been... Well, it should stay the
same over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you do fix the genotype by the
cloning because it's a clonally propagated
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have created something that's
valuable, it stays, it can be propagated
[SPEAKER_00]: and kept the same over many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: in many locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the obstacles in the breeding
process that are what I would consider
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, but that's part of the
conventional agriculture in a clonally
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of cassava, there is this
issue of once a breeding program has
[SPEAKER_00]: developed something superior, and they're
ready to release it, then there needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a propagation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: At IITA, they've been experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nice method for doing this in
a kind of semi-tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more ex-plant culture under aseptic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I was there, for example,
they had thousands of little boxes of sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of plexiglass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would ship it out to Catholic
charities, and then Catholic charities in
[SPEAKER_00]: turn would plant them out where the plants
would be grown for one cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a process going where you can
quickly amplify or propagate to large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale for a release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar things have to happen in any
breeding program where you go from initial
[SPEAKER_00]: small little handful of seed to you want
to have now thousands of bushels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read the story about Norman Borlaug
taking, releasing lines in India,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's a really big part of the
whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cassava, it's especially
challenging because it is this vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation, but it is doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just requires some, you know,
have some resources, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: devoted to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is the advantage that once it's
released, then it can be shared with
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors, and it's always identical,
and it can be disseminated and spread if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an acceptable and highly desirable
variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned in your kind of future
vision that you were planning on saying if
[SPEAKER_04]: there was an effect of the red light with
PGR together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you done any initial studies on that,
and is it synergistic in addition to what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're getting with STS and STA?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done some small studies and shown
that I wouldn't say it's synergistic,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they do work together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, especially with what you said,
the red light and the STS, those are kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of two different factors because one is
dealing with the timing of flowering,
[SPEAKER_05]: and one is dealing with flowering
abundance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did want to make sure that,
you know, it still works under the red
[SPEAKER_05]: lights, and it does, but we didn't
identify really a synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the sort of thing that,
for example, Hernan Sabalios at SEOT is
[SPEAKER_00]: actively working on, as well as our
colleagues at IITA, particularly and at
[SPEAKER_00]: CRI.
