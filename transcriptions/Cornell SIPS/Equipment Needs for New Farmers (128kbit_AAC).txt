[SPEAKER_00]: Is this recording?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the recorded version of the
equipment webinar for Beginning Farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening to it, that means
that Charles Bourne and his wife Meg are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the process of having their first
child.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wish them luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy that he spent some
time in advance to tape this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move us into the classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to introduce Chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck is the team leader for the Capital
District Vegetable and Berry Extension
[SPEAKER_00]: Program in the Greater Capital District of
New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spent the first four years of his
extension career in the Eden Valley and
[SPEAKER_00]: then has been in the Capital District for
a little more than eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the person that we, Crystal and I,
turn to all the time for information about
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a specialist with vine crops and
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has his own small farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just let Chuck take it
from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate his effort on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on the webinar
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry that I could not be with you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Laura said, my wife and I are
expecting our first child at any moment
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a preexisting, I guess,
thing to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, Crystal and Laura asked me to
kind of go over some of the basics on what
[SPEAKER_01]: a beginning or small farmer might need for
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, equipment comes in all
shapes and sizes and colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to take a little bit of
time tonight to just go through some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that I think are important when
you start to look at purchasing equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to get started here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do we start?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first question that we all
have to ask ourselves is what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: scale are we looking at to farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be a half acre,
five acres, 25 acres?
[SPEAKER_01]: It all makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially as you start to increase your
acreage, your equipment needs are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's mostly for an efficiency factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for example, and we'll talk about
this in a little bit, but a two bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: plow worked great for two acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not work as well for five acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes you so much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may need to go to a four bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing we have to ask
ourselves is how much labor do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only how much labor or time do you
have, but also what quality do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, in my case, I have an aunt
that's 83 years old that works quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: with me, but obviously she can't do as
much as, let's say, a 33 year old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you have to kind of keep that
in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to that scale of size, do you have a
lot of hand labor crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like greens that may take a little
bit longer, or are you going to rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: more mechanization, more equipment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Long ago, it was drummed into me by my dad
to work smarter and not harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you can mechanize something
and it's not going to cost you an
[SPEAKER_01]: outrageous amount of money, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes your life a lot easier,
improves your quality of life,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it could also improve the quality of
your product as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think you have to ask yourself,
what do you already have for equipment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you inherit equipment, or are you
starting from scratch?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are in a neighborhood where
there's other farms close to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: what might you be able to hire out or to
have somebody else do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like getting fields ready for
planting and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't have the equipment,
it might be as easy for someone to just
[SPEAKER_01]: come and do it for you and pay them,
or rent machinery from those folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if they're local enough and
they don't mind doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thought that I like to think
about is have a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes your life a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it's on all ends, whether it's
preparing ground, whether it's planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, for example, know that you want to
take this three-acre field and break it
[SPEAKER_01]: into three one-acre blocks, and within
those blocks, you know how many beds or
[SPEAKER_01]: how many rows you're going to have at
certain spacing, this really allows you to
[SPEAKER_01]: make some decisions about equipment,
size of equipment, spacing of equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, for me, I'm one of those guys
that likes to learn visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put this little diagram together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this was one whole field, so this whole
big blue block is one field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within that one big field,
you know that you want to have eight rows
[SPEAKER_01]: in each one of those blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight beds, I guess, is the best way to
say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if each one of these black lines
represents a bed that's 48 inches wide and
[SPEAKER_01]: from the center of this bed to the center
of this bed is exactly eight feet every
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know exactly how many row feet
you have or how many bed feet you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: that block.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make sure that you have the right
number of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things can be answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like the idea of putting in
permanent driveways between my fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps not only just to get product in
and out and field work, but actually it
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps a lot of soil compaction out of your
actual fields, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you can harvest from these four
rows and bring it to the driveway and put
[SPEAKER_01]: it on a trailer, obviously that is one
less tractor pass across that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts all the traffic rate in that
driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, that you need to
keep in mind, and this goes back to
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, is if this bed is too wide,
you may not find a tractor that can go
[SPEAKER_01]: wide enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, there are a lot of
tractors will not go any wider,
[SPEAKER_01]: the wheel spacing, any wider than 60
inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can actually play into certain
bed spacing that you might not be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go wider than 60 inches,
then you have to find somebody that can,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good machinist that can actually weld
things for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the question I think that
probably comes up first is what size
[SPEAKER_01]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for a small farmer,
beginning farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said earlier, they come in all
different shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that predominantly my two
favorites are probably the John Deere
[SPEAKER_01]: series and also the Kubota series.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that I'm promoting either one,
but I just think that in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: versatility, I think they have the widest
range of tractors that you can select
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a couple thoughts on
tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that this is a little bit
of my opinion in this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most growers that start off would
probably recommend, well, one tractor that
[SPEAKER_01]: can do a lot of things, but two tractors
that are very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: One tractor would be the one that performs
what we call the manual labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's a tractor that does a lot of
the plowing and field fitting and hauls a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the heavy implements and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one is more of what I call
the finesse tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once things are established,
this might be used to cultivate or it
[SPEAKER_01]: might be used to hill or somewhere along
those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every farm needs two tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other nice thing about having multiple
tractors is that you might be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: leave, you know, a certain implement that
you use a lot, you might be able to leave
[SPEAKER_01]: right on one tractor for a long time
instead of having to take it on and off
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the utility tractor, which is going to
be the bigger tractor or what I call the
[SPEAKER_01]: grunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you need to know what you're going
to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be moldboard plowing,
rototilling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be carrying a disc over
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk all about those pieces of
implements here in a few minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just wanted to give you an idea of
what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in general, you know, anybody
that's probably an acre to 10 acres will
[SPEAKER_01]: do fine with a 35 to 40 horsepower
tractor, especially if it's four wheel
[SPEAKER_01]: drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of reasons why I like a
four wheel drive tractor as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_01]: two wheel drive tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that it takes a lot less horsepower
to do the same job as a two wheel tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four wheel drive tractors just make
work a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take as much out on that
tractor if it's four wheel compared to two
[SPEAKER_01]: wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: For certain equipment like bed shapers and
other things, you have more control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to actually steer when you
have a implement on the back rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of hoping that you're going in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what it also boils down to is
you need to know what kind of horse power
[SPEAKER_01]: is needed for those implements that you're
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the best thing to do is you
really need to talk to, if you're buying
[SPEAKER_01]: it from, you know, a dealership,
you talk to the dealership and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: all the specs on how many horsepower a
certain unit takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you tell them what tractor they
have, usually they can find you that
[SPEAKER_01]: implement to match it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to buy it used and
you're going through a wanted digest or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you may still want to talk to a
dealer and just get his thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not your tractor can pull that
implement that you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best example I can give you again
is if you have a 30 horsepower tractor and
[SPEAKER_01]: you buy a five bottom plow, you're not
going to pull that five bottom plow with a
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 horsepower tractor, whether it's four
wheel drive or two wheel drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go into that here in a
minute when I talk about more board plows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I'd like to have on
one of those tractors is a loader frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's for a bucket loader
or a set of pallet forks, either one,
[SPEAKER_01]: become very, very useful on any farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even better if it can be what we
call a quick-tatch bucket or frame where
[SPEAKER_01]: these frames have their own stands for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you pull this pin right here and then
you can unhook the hoses and back right
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the whole loader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it pretty convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pull right back in and hook right
back up if you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these pallet forks can be very
useful, especially if you start doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: growing of some vine crops or other things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can actually just put a cardboard
tub on here with a pallet and move it
[SPEAKER_01]: right through the field and then load it
onto a wagon or unload it when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pallet forks come in very,
very handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is with any of this
machinery, inevitably, it will break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than likely, it'll break down when
you probably need it at the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I tell guys is to find a good
local mechanic if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes for especially used
equipment that you purchase so that there
[SPEAKER_01]: may not be any support there from a dealer
or you just don't know how that equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: was used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the grower that had it before you
took good care of it, you might not have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more than likely, you're going to end
up with something breaking at some point
[SPEAKER_01]: in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is if that mechanic or
if you can find somebody else that's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: machinist, there are certain pieces of
equipment that may need some tweaking just
[SPEAKER_01]: to fit your certain operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find a good machinist early
on in your farming career and a good
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanic, you're going to be a lot happier
because they can really make it or break
[SPEAKER_01]: it sometimes when it comes to fixing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to just start going over just
a couple of basics components of tractors
[SPEAKER_01]: that are pretty important, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear the term three-point
hitch used an awful lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking about smaller
acreages, most of your equipment is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be three-point hitched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a three-point hitch is really,
it's just primarily used for lifting
[SPEAKER_01]: implements that are pulled behind the
tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three main, what I call three
main components in pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these two lift arms right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is this top link piece
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you purchase an older tractor,
you may be required to add something
[SPEAKER_01]: called sway bars or stabilizer bars,
as they're sometimes called, which again,
[SPEAKER_01]: they predominantly mount underneath right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are the same length as your lift arm,
but it just keeps the two lift arms from
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to separate and wobble for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the newer tractors have this
turnbuckle system, or they have a pin
[SPEAKER_01]: system, which is a lot, so they don't need
a standalone set of sway bars,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very detailed schematic of
all the different components of a
[SPEAKER_01]: three-point hitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also important that I
point out that there are several different
[SPEAKER_01]: sizes of three-point hitches, and this
correlates to equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like a small lawn tractor
that has a three-point hitch would be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered a category zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that is really large,
a big piece of heavy machinery,
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a larger, because it's heavier,
it takes a larger set of arms and whatnot
[SPEAKER_01]: to lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a completely different set of pins
and whatnot, so that it's a lot larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the machinery that we deal with
falls between the category one and two,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for smaller growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so a typical, again, and I just
wanted to give you another little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: schematic and how these things fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a brush hog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have these, what they call link
pins on either side, okay, of your
[SPEAKER_01]: three-point hitch implement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is these, oh,
let me go back to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: These arms right here slip right off right
over those pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have another what we call a
little linchpin that goes right through
[SPEAKER_01]: and secures that link pin within that lift
arm so it can't slide off, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that top link arm slips right in
there, and you go ahead and you put a pin
[SPEAKER_01]: right through there and lock that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that top link does is it's on a
it's on threads, so it helps you adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: the pitch, so to speak, of your implement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to tip it forward or
backwards, it lets you adjust your pitch
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these draw arms are what really help
you raise and lower that piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and set your depth for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oop, going the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I really like,
and they're not very expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gotten a lot cheaper over the last
couple years, is called a quick hitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this piece of machine, this little
piece of machinery here hooks onto your
[SPEAKER_01]: three-point hitch, okay, and it's
permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays right on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hooked right onto your tractor all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really nice is that as you go
to hook up a piece of three-point hitch
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, essentially you just back rate
to it, you back under it, and those link
[SPEAKER_01]: pins fall right into place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your top link, you leave a bolt in the
piece of machinery so your top link fits
[SPEAKER_01]: right in there, and then you just get in
and you lock these handles down and it
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps that implement from coming off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really convenient and safe way
of hooking up a piece of three-point hitch
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you that it can be very
frustrating sometimes hooking up
[SPEAKER_01]: three-point hitch implements because no
matter what you do, you just can't seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: get things lined up and you're on and off
that tractor five or six different times
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes just to finally get that thing
lined up and get it hooked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's nice again about this
three-point hitch is it takes all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: right out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets you hook right up, back right up,
get onto it, and take right off again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other piece, especially if you're
going to use a lot of different machinery,
[SPEAKER_01]: will take what we call a power takeoff or
a PTO shaft or drive, and that is what
[SPEAKER_01]: makes things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes rudder-tailor blades go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes brush-hide blades turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes baler motors run the whole nine
yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the spline end of your tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the shaft from your piece of
equipment which slips right over that
[SPEAKER_01]: spline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This right here is your PTO shaft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this spins at a pretty high
speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be very careful when
you're working around a PTO that's engaged
[SPEAKER_01]: or running because loose clothing can get
caught on this and it can wrap around that
[SPEAKER_01]: shaft and literally spin you right into
[SPEAKER_01]: the PTO shaft, and you do not want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to just kind of start from
scratch here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about what I call primary
tillage, or it's the very first tillage
[SPEAKER_01]: that you may have to do to prepare a
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, I'm going to refer
mostly to what we call moldboard plowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, primary tillage is done to
prepare that seed bed or prepare ground
[SPEAKER_01]: for shading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for scraping and for
transplanting later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may want to incorporate residue,
whether it's crop residue, a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even compost in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be used to help level out a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also we use it as a means of
disease and insect control as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of reasons why we do
primary tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've heard me talk about this a
couple times, but this is what we call a
[SPEAKER_01]: moldboard plow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we say moldboard, this is what we
refer to right here as a moldboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in all colors, shapes,
sizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and widths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is pretty important because
depending on how much of what we call a
[SPEAKER_01]: swath or how wide this portion is right
here, it's going to vary on how many
[SPEAKER_01]: horsepower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a lot less horsepower to pull
a 14-inch wide moldboard than it does
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to a 20-inch moldboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as I said, they come in all shapes
and sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them in from one bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this whole thing right here is
considered a one bottom or a two bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: which this is, or three bottoms,
all the way up to 20 bottoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can get very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to recommend sets that have these
trash wheels or sod cutters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes a much cleaner cut when you
go into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lets that, in this case over here,
if you look, it lets this sod roll under
[SPEAKER_01]: really nicely and get incorporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing too is they can come in
manual or automatic resets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you're going along and if you hit a
big rock, these things don't, if these
[SPEAKER_01]: moldboards didn't have any give to them,
they would just snap off or they would
[SPEAKER_01]: stall your tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens lots of times is that a
manual reset, these will just,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a big spring in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These will come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to get over whatever it
was, a rock or a hard pan or a tree stump.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get over it and then you just back up
and it just resets this moldboard to where
[SPEAKER_01]: it was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fancier ones and more expensive ones
are these automatic resets where you just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are again, two big compression
springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing just kind of pushes up and
then the springs force it right back down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the rest of these are all manual
resets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some terminology that you may
hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's your moldboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your plow point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what takes most of the abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very abrasive when you're pulling
through that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your sod cutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the backside is something that
we call a landslide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a shin, what we call a
shin there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's these landslides and these plow
points that we end up replacing depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on how many acres you do and depending on
your soil type.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually they need to be replaced every
one or two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let these shins, this upper piece
here or you let these landslides or the
[SPEAKER_01]: plow points get wore down, then it starts
to erode into your moldboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would much rather pay the $15 to
replace this little piece here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to the $150 it costs to replace
this big moldboard piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep that in the back of your mind
as we go, as you think about plows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a real knack to learn how to
moldboard plow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken me probably a lot of hours
sitting on the tractor with my father and
[SPEAKER_01]: my brothers to learn how to moldboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some days I'm not even sure I'm still
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important just to think
about, again, it goes back to what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: system or develop a system for your
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the easiest system is to just
break those fields into smaller blocks and
[SPEAKER_01]: then moldboard plow in one direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it just kind of
keeps the field on a level plane over as
[SPEAKER_01]: you keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm going to tell you that your
first pass is your most important because
[SPEAKER_01]: that sets the tone for the rest of your
passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it as straight as possible
because once you get a little cock-eyed,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you don't pay attention and you
start steering away around something or
[SPEAKER_01]: you get off a little bit, once you get
crooked, it's hard to straighten that pass
[SPEAKER_01]: up until you're all done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you might be able to clean it up
later with some other tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is, so this guy has
made his first pass on this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's driving this way, coming toward
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's flipping soil this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what he's going to do is he's going to
pick this plow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is going to then just drive all the way
back down here with the up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's going to put his front tire right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's going to drop that plow in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got one tire, his front,
one front tires in this furrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his other tires up here on the grass,
he's going to drop the plow and then he's
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to make his next pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just going to keep making that
until he is all the way over to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again,
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this guy right here, you can see
he's going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone right along and it may not look
like it, but his front tire is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: right here in the pass that he made
previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to go right along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that same front tire right there will
be right here when he comes back through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so over here, he threw soil on the
side, but when he gets over to the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: this field, he's going to have something
that looks like this, which we call a dead
[SPEAKER_01]: furrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really, it's important,
and this is the other reason why I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: plow one way, is that every time you plow,
whether it's once a year or twice a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: move this dead furrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this year the dead furrow is on this
side, next year you're going to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: plow, you're going to actually start on
this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is it helps fill this in
a little bit and leave the dead furrow on
[SPEAKER_01]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the year after that, you're going
to reverse it and just, and just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will keep you from, from really
making any ditches on either side of your
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it nice and level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So secondary tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you get through and you,
you go ahead and you moldboard plow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I should mention too, I'll just go
back here real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: These moldboards can cost, they're all
over the place depending on how war they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, how many bottoms there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say on average, you're probably
going to end up about a hundred to $150 a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom for manual resets and probably more
in the range of two, $250, $300 for those
[SPEAKER_01]: that are automatic resets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can be, they can become quite
costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, it depends on what
kind of shape the whole frame and whatnot
[SPEAKER_01]: is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just an idea of what it might cost you
for a moldboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, secondary, secondary tillage as
I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we go through with our moldboards,
we still don't really have a seed bed
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that we could plan into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we come through with some type of
secondary tillage where we break up those
[SPEAKER_01]: clods and clumps, level it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then that allows for our
seeders and transplanters to move through
[SPEAKER_01]: or our betters for that matter,
to move through a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are lots and lots of tools out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the most widely or common
secondary tillage tool is a, is a,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call a disc or disc harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's just these round disc that
they, as they go through the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: they chew up and they level out a little
bit and they break up all those clods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really nice is that these are,
they're easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in a lot of different widths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, you know, find them anywhere
like right here, which is about a four
[SPEAKER_01]: footer, you know, up to this one,
which is a 14 footer, but just keep in
[SPEAKER_01]: mind, that with that extra width,
you have to keep increasing your
[SPEAKER_01]: horsepower every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, something like this three
point hitch one right here, you can pull
[SPEAKER_01]: with as little as, you know, 30 horsepower
without really making the tractor work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this one up here, you know,
you're looking at really a 90 horsepower
[SPEAKER_01]: tractor to pull that comfortably.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing too is, is you get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They no longer become three point hitch,
but they become hydraulic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where there's these two or three point
hitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs those that lift arms that we
talked about in the back earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one does not, it actually has a
hydraulic cylinder right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's hoses that hook to the back of
your tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually lifts on these,
this set of wheels right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's, you're talking about a
much larger piece of machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these disc harrows, again,
price ranges all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on if they're new or used and
with, and what kind of shape they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite secondary tillage tool is
something called a Perfecta Harrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it pulls a little easier than
disc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this toolbar and it's got these,
what we call Danish S tines, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: these sweeps on the end of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as this goes through the field,
it actually kind of starts to fill in
[SPEAKER_01]: those voids made by the disc or made by
the mold boards that you went through with
[SPEAKER_01]: and breaks up some of the clumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this right here is a leveler bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is a rolling basket in the
back, which really helps break up those
[SPEAKER_01]: clods and clumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really just does a super nice job of
preparing a seed bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you see right here, anywhere
between one and a half to three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: horsepower per S tine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that varies because of the width of
these sweeps that you put on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot more horsepower to pull a
three inch wide sweep than it does just a
[SPEAKER_01]: one inch sweep, as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what's nice is they come in
varying widths.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go anywhere from six to 36 feet to
30 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a very good tool and a tool that
I think at some point in time,
[SPEAKER_01]: every farm does need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one are these three point hitch
rototillers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are fine for growing very fine
seeded crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They prepare a really super fine seed bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are some issues they can be
very slow because if you are into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's got a lot of sod,
it may actually take you two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: passes to get a bed like you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not really made to go very deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really just like a,
you know, that three inch tillage depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: which for some crops is fine, but for
others they like it a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can require a fair amount of
horsepower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, because you are, you know,
not using three point hitch, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: PTO, the power takeoff, which is going to
draw some extra power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 900 for a very narrow one,
that's probably about a four footer,
[SPEAKER_01]: up to $3,000 on a six footer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there are many manufacturers
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kuhn, which is the guy on the bottom here,
probably being one of the higher end
[SPEAKER_01]: rototillers, in my opinion, a very nice
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I don't particularly
care for about rototillers is that they
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much destroy a good chunk of your
soil structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They break this soil up so fine that you
can run into some problems with some soil
[SPEAKER_01]: tilt later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's a whole nother talk
discussion for another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a piece of machinery, which I
don't expect a lot of new farmers to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown in popularity the last couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a spader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, it's got these,
what we call, well, they call them spader
[SPEAKER_01]: teeth, but they look like giant tines with
big sweep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially what they do is they don't
really till soil, but they just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it up and stir it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this kind of this leveler
unit here in the back, which helps break
[SPEAKER_01]: up some clumps, push clumps down in the
ground, and also just kind of give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, again, they're quite slow,
because you need to take your time in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get enough of those spader knives
to go down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are expensive, and you need a
large horsepower tractor to run it
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to see how these work,
there's a good website with some good
[SPEAKER_01]: videos right here that you can go ahead
and take a look at and see how those units
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think for beginning farmers,
this is a little bit of overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, they had gained popularity,
but there are a couple folks that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that have them that actually have parked
them because they were just taking too
[SPEAKER_01]: much time to prepare their fields with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage, again, is that they are not
as hard on your soil as a rototiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they maintain a little bit of your soil
structure for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are actually very good
incorporators of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is kind of convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for smaller acreage, I love this
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they call a BCS tiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't even call, they call these
units tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see right here, this is the
base unit right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I love about it is the handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what this, it's supposed to be
depicting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those handles rotate essentially 180
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can have either rear mounted
equipment attachments or front mounted
[SPEAKER_01]: attachments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the price range for the versatility of
these units is not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, the price for these base
units and probably one accessory can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: quite widely is depending on what you're
looking for horsepower wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to show you the versatility of
these units, these are just all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different attachments that they make for
these tractor units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, things can be rear mounted or
front mounted depending on how you swivel
[SPEAKER_01]: the handles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other feature that I like about
this unit is this is actually what they
[SPEAKER_01]: call their power hiller attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in circumstances where you
guys might have high tunnels or unheated
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to make some raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these power hiller attachment
units on the BCS tractors could actually
[SPEAKER_01]: do a very good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, these are very versatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be great for smaller acreages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're going to have
some high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're going to be a vegetable
or small fruit grower, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables, I think you're going to want
to look at using plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to really get the benefit out
of a plastic mulch, you're going to want a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good bed shaper or actually a mulch
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's just a couple different models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are what we call flat bed mulch
layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they pretty much just lay that piece of
plastic right on a level pretty much with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just a little tiny bit of a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, it is just going to
be right on the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a buckeye tractor unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is my pointer?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one without plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you can see them laying this nice
row of plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This green unit right here is a rain flow
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for I think the larger operations,
the rain flow unit is where I would steer
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a couple acres, these buckeye units
really do a nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a little less expensive than
some of the rain flow models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, rain flow is a company out of
Pennsylvania that makes a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of nice vegetable equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's built well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavy duty and rugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I highly would recommend you talking
to those folks if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these bed shapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other option is you can do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I'm going to tell you that to get
the biggest benefit out of this plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch, you want a nice tight bed,
as tight as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if it's loose and floppy,
you don't get the maximum benefit out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's all you've got for the first
couple years, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just another flatbed model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one made by Mechanical
Transplanter Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, all of these models,
most of them I should say, can come in
[SPEAKER_01]: various widths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere from, as you see here,
a three foot wide to a six foot wide
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic roll that can accommodate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can have beds that are 28
inches wide to almost five feet,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how big you want your beds to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you continue to expand maybe your farm,
I really think it starts to make sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what we call raised bed plastic
mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I would steer you to rain flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably their model 2550 is one of their
most popular models, or 2600.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these units, they look big and fairly
aggressive, and they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at comfortably probably
a 70 horsepower tractor, preferably with
[SPEAKER_01]: four wheel drive to really do a good job
at using this machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see right here, this is what
actually gathers the soil to make the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular unit is set up to actually
apply a liquid fertilizer underneath,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also drip irrigation tape,
or drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that right here,
these units can make anywhere from a two
[SPEAKER_01]: inch to a six inch high raised bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, depending on what attachments
and accessories that you get, they can be
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from $3,300 to $5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, something that you're probably
gonna think about once you get established
[SPEAKER_01]: and start to increase your acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these raised beds are where you really
start to gain some of your production,
[SPEAKER_01]: your yield increases, earlyness,
and drainage too, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be on heavy soils that tend to stay
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may definitely wanna think about one
of these raised bed shapers at some point
[SPEAKER_01]: in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get everything made, you get your
fields plowed and fitted, and if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using plastic, you get your plastic laid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get your plants planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I gotta tell you that rain flow
irrigation makes what we call a water
[SPEAKER_01]: wheel transplanter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this does essentially is,
I've got a better picture of it here in a
[SPEAKER_01]: second, but I'll just explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two tanks are full of water,
and there is a hose that comes down into
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call a wheel, which has these
spikes onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you travel down the field,
these spikes roll and they punch holes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plastic at whatever spacing you
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wheels all come in different spacings,
so you choose what size wheel fits the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop needs for that particular crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that little steel spike goes into
the soil, it actually fills it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you take these plants and you
put them in the hole, they are being put
[SPEAKER_01]: right into a transplant hole that's full
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a different unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This again is Buckeye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckeye makes a great piece of machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, rain flow is not the
only ones on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys do a very nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually do a very nice job for
smaller scale growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these pieces of machinery from Buckeye,
they're heavy duty, but they are not
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendously overbuilt, but they're very
durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here again, this is a good picture of
that water wheel that I just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see these spikes right here
are what makes the holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this doesn't have a spike on it,
but underneath this spike, if you were to
[SPEAKER_01]: see it, would be this hole right there,
which lets the water escape into the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a complete water wheel unit
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also just purchase from Buckeye
just the dry wheel parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after your beds are all made or even in
bare soil, they don't have to have plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: on them, you can actually take and run
this unit over and it'll punch the holes
[SPEAKER_01]: into the plastic or into your soil that
you're desired spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you come back through and you can
plant it by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, pretty economical for 600 bucks
or so to purchase this unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing too is that this is a
pretty nice toolbar that you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: hang some other stuff on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff off of later on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Mechanical Transplanter,
they also have their version of a raised
[SPEAKER_01]: bed maker right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, it's a lot simpler,
not as many parts and not as heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you need very, very light soils for
this kind of unit to work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another reason why I like the
Rainflow units is they work in just about
[SPEAKER_01]: every soil type and do a very consistent
job in all those soil types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanical also makes a transplanting
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a mulch planter or pot planter
Model 900 that you see right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially what happens is as you
drive through, this is ground driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: These spikes that you see right here,
these yellow ones, rotate around and the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy that's sitting here just puts the
plant right there in that spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it comes around, it pushes
into the plastic, the spike or the cup
[SPEAKER_01]: actually opens up, lets the plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right here, there are what we
call pack wheels and that pushes the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is dry, so there's no water or
anything involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do make them with water attachments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of moving parts, not as forgiving on
transplant height.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be just the right,
those transplants have to be the right
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're too big, what happens is this
cup actually, that little hinge unit right
[SPEAKER_01]: there will close back onto it before it's
off of the plant and it pulls it right
[SPEAKER_01]: back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see where they actually tear plastic
more, I think, and you end up with more
[SPEAKER_01]: problems later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find these out there,
fairly inexpensive used ones that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: decent shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, is a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think you can buy a water wheel
for probably still less money and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: much more versatile than one of these
mulch planters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about transplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably one of the things you'll do first
before you do a lot of transplanting is
[SPEAKER_01]: some direct seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of direct seeding units for
smaller growers, there's a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular unit right here is what we
call an Earthway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by the company called Earthway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need a good seed bed so that
the unit pushes easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we call a plate planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that there's all these
different inserts that go into this hopper
[SPEAKER_01]: right here, which determines what you
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these push seeders are really good for
beans, corn, and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not it, so on the larger seeded
stuff they do a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get to the finer seeded
things like beets and carrots and
[SPEAKER_01]: lettuces, they don't do as good a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either too thick or they're too
far apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to fine tune where you want
those seeds to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold Planet Junior, they have been around
for a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is a hand seeder, but you can
also purchase these units to go on a
[SPEAKER_01]: toolbar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a three row bed that they're
planting, and it could be to lettuce or
[SPEAKER_01]: carrots or beets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a much better job, more accurate
job than the Earthway I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually don't have plates in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a little sizer gauge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right on the side there, you kind of
dial in what your crop is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sets that little trap door to let
just the right amount of seed through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're a little more durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a good seed bed, but probably not
as good as a seed bed you need for that
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthway.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you start to increase in the amount of
what you want to pay, the seeders get
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are what we call belt seeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that all these different
belts are all made for different size
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, different spacings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be standalone push units like
this, or again, mounted on a toolbar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, they are fairly expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,500 just for the base unit,
and then you have to buy all the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual belts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you're looking at doing a
lot of greens, a lot of small,
[SPEAKER_01]: fine seeded things, carrots, beets,
onions, direct seeded onions, these do a
[SPEAKER_01]: very nice job, very precise job on those
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fairly new seeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only been on the market for a couple
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Yang Clean Seeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's sold by Mechanical
Transplanter Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same guys that made those
transplanters I talked about a few minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't use plates or belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead, it uses this roller design
right here, or right here as you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is that they just take
these rollers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drill them out to the appropriate
seed size and spacing that you wish for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they can be individual,
mounted push seeders like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: mounted in a gang like that, and
moderately priced for a single unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push unit, $400 is not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fairly accurate and fairly easy
to change as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another key component of some
of these units, is how long does it take
[SPEAKER_01]: you to clean seed out and switch out if
you're doing multiple varieties of
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these do a very good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Johnny Selected Seeds is a local
distributor here of these units,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can find them in the Johnny
Selected Seed catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these are always pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a company out of Pennsylvania that
builds this, what they call two different
[SPEAKER_01]: versions of a stand-in plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is essentially what you could use
for transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peppers, they have to be fairly small,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes, eggplant, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just by hand, there's not a lot of
moving parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You slip the plant in, push it into the
ground, pull the handle and pull it out
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's your transplant right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have this planet stick,
which you can use for direct seeded stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, you jab it in the ground and
you drop your seeds in right in the top
[SPEAKER_01]: and pull it out and keep walking right on
down the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can do quite a bit of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little tiny bit about some other
implements that will probably be used or
[SPEAKER_01]: could be used, especially if you're
thinking about doing a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: not as much mechanization, but a lot of
hand labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna tell you, I have done an
awful lot of hoeing in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple units that come in
pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part of what we call a wheel hoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk a little bit about a wheel
hoe in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: An earlier version was, again,
Planet Junior used to make, they were the
[SPEAKER_01]: first ones to really come out with this
type of wheel hoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't find this anymore unless you go
to an antique place, but you will find
[SPEAKER_01]: these new versions right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, there's your hand
hose, stirp hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they call these potato hose and
a prong hoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, your old-fashioned spade
hoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, talk a little bit about wheel
hoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For cultivating, weeding right here,
these work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even to do a little bit of hilling or if
you wanna make a furrow to plant something
[SPEAKER_01]: into, these are pretty versatile units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that price range is three to
$400.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get down through some tight
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're putting a couple rows of
lettuce or carrots or something on one
[SPEAKER_01]: bed, if you space it right, you might be
able to get right down through there with
[SPEAKER_01]: a wheel hoe with one of these stirp hose
right on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a very good job of cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think crop sprayers is something that we
saw sometimes overlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanna have the highest quality
product, whether it's conventionally
[SPEAKER_01]: grown, organically grown, there are some
pesticides out there that are things like
[SPEAKER_01]: coppers, a fungicide which has been around
for a long time, still does a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be able to improve that crop
quality, I think, is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go very simple with a backpack or
handheld sprayer like this Solo unit right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can get a 15, 20 gallon ATV-mounted
unit that's got an electric pump or even
[SPEAKER_01]: mount this in the trailer of a small
pull-behind lawn tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can, as you get bigger and you need
to cover a lot of territory a little
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker, you can go to a three-point hitch
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That usually has a PTO-driven pump,
but you can also stay with an electric
[SPEAKER_01]: pump that are anywhere between three and
200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the prices range all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 bucks for this little Solo backpack
sprayer, 100, 150 for the ATV sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can spend upwards of three,
$4,000 on a three-point hitch unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A unit like you see right here in this
picture is probably gonna cost you about
[SPEAKER_01]: 450 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then probably another 80, 90 bucks for
the PTO pump or an electric pump if you
[SPEAKER_01]: decide to go with that version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talked earlier, I talked about a
second tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of the finesse tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are just a couple models.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a fair amount of models that are
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three that you see here are what we
call offset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are not looking, you're not seated
right in the center of the tractor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you are actually offset so that you
get a good view of the crop that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's right down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's various types of cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of these happen to be what we
call sweep cultivators and mounted in all
[SPEAKER_01]: different configurations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key with that second cultivating
tractor or any tractor that you wanna use
[SPEAKER_01]: for cultivating is the clearance or the
amount of space that's between the belly
[SPEAKER_01]: of the tractor and the crop that you're
trying to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, these three right here are
what we call high clearance tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of distance between your
crop and also the belly of your tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want that because you don't wanna
be really bending that crop over if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can avoid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, these are our older units.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They range all over in prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a cub high boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find one with cultivators for 1500
bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in decent shape up to this 274
diesel unit, which you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to $4,4500 for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are still out there and still
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little more of a specialty item.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to see these a lot on organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation, especially for wheat control,
is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are Alice Chomber G Series.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for a newer version,
there is a newer version out there called
[SPEAKER_01]: the Stockville.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are newer units that look very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very similar to this, but of
course have all the updates of power
[SPEAKER_01]: steering and hydraulics and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can still find these G units
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, very versatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one that's set up with cultivator
sweeps, two different styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a unit that's been set up for
hilling to make probably raised beds or to
[SPEAKER_01]: even make raised beds to lay plastic on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a unit that's even been set up
for moldboard plowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the most sought after implement
for this, for these G Series, are this
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call a basket weeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are really good for closely
planted rows of things like lettuce,
[SPEAKER_01]: beets, carrots, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't move a lot of soil,
but they disturb enough to do a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the weeds are really,
really tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the key with really any of the
cultivators that you may see or hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: is the weeds need to be small to do a
really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on an older implement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've updated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called the hillside cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these units have become popular in the
last few years because, as you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: here, they are able to be used for
cultivating between rows of plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things are, they're three-point
hitch, but they are hydraulic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have two cylinders up here which
allow the operator to actually move these
[SPEAKER_01]: units in and out depending on how wide
they need to go to get across that row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very versatile, very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only for plastic, but also for bare
ground crops too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a very good job of cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else that you may need,
especially if you are thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: having some animals on your farm or if
you're going to be more on the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things and you're going to be
needing to spread compost, are manure
[SPEAKER_01]: spreaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the key here is to match the
size of the manure spreader to your
[SPEAKER_01]: tractor to make sure that you're not going
to have a manure spreader that's way too
[SPEAKER_01]: big when you get it filled up to be able
to pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another example too of a
tractor, having a tractor that's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: loader on it so that you can actually load
these spreaders if you have a bulk load of
[SPEAKER_01]: compost delivered to your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a drop spreader, so we can use
these for lime or fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still make these units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Market Farm Implements, which is a website
for you here at the end, makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these fertilizer drop units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really good if you only want
to fertilize certain widths of beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a pretty good job, pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if you call this
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider it equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider it a very important piece of
equipment on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that are harvest containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've spent all your time and a lot of
money to get a crop to harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want to maintain that quality
as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having good harvest containers,
but also containers that maybe can double
[SPEAKER_01]: for marketing purposes, like these shallow
gray containers right here for putting a
[SPEAKER_01]: single layer of tomatoes in, especially if
you're growing some softer heirloom types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even these larger green units.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are great for greens, especially if
you've got to harvest and then put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cooler to cool them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reusable just as long as you keep
them clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they just help provide a much
higher quality crop in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that model of work, smarter,
not harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you only have a small market
garden, these little pole hand carts are
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got those big flotation tires so
they move easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones with sides are great because you
can put some of those harvest containers
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and not have to worry about them
falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also even just having a hand
truck to move stuff around is very useful,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're going to do some
farmers markets and you may have to walk a
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every farm probably should also
have some kind of, I call it a whirly gig
[SPEAKER_01]: spreader.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can use them to spread fertilizer
or cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in some instances, even crop seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually use a seeder like this right
here to plant purple top turnips for root
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all different versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here's a pull type.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, here's a hand seeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sling type.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a push type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all different levels of these
spreaders that you can go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flame weeders, again, if you're growing
crops that there are not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicides labeled on or if you're going
to be organic, having a flame weeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is a homemade unit made by
Michael Kilpatrick, who's a grower up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Granville.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's his little heat shield unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of his flame is coming out of these
four ports right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's got the propane tank right
there on his back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does a very good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, he's got this bed ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably been ready for a couple
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's got some seeds that have
germinated, some weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to go through, hit it with
the flame weeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's done it a couple times,
then maybe he'll plant right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or he may go through and stir this up a
little bit again and come back through the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed with the flameer in a couple days
just to kill any more weeds that may have
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just another little interesting piece
of equipment that could be useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be a vegetable or small
fruit grower, you are going to at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point in time need an irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it is an overhead system like
these two, okay, where you're pumping it
[SPEAKER_01]: out to a reel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're using drip irrigation,
you still need a pump to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the water to those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it may not be the very first
thing that you think of, but within a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple years, you're really going to need
to think about some type of irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is obviously not a complete list,
but this is a list of places to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: machinery that I often use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think again, I think a good
spot to start might be with a local
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural dealer, you know,
like a John Deere, New Holland,
[SPEAKER_01]: or there's a bunch of them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good place to find tractors,
good used tractors too, but then also to
[SPEAKER_01]: have some support there in terms of
finding, you know, matching equipment with
[SPEAKER_01]: your tractor needs and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanted Digest or Craigslist could be a
place to find some machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to auctions in the fall or spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a publication out there called
Fastline, which I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I subscribe to the Northeast Regional
Edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it either hard copy,
it depends on if you want to pay for it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it free and it comes once a
month, or you can get it, you can pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it comes on a weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's essentially all the, or a lot of
the agricultural equipment dealers
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere from Maine all the way down to
I think Virginia for the Northeast edition
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a good place to at least
locate some dealers maybe in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tractorhouse.com is another good place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wangers is a used equipment dealership in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a nice job, good support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with Rotors Farm Equipment out of
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I mentioned them once already and
that's Market Farm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that I did not put here would
be Rain Flow, but I've talked about them
[SPEAKER_01]: several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is Buckeye Equipment
Company, especially for those mulch layers
[SPEAKER_01]: or those transplanters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Waterwheel in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other places, Country Folks Grower,
and actually not just to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, but maybe to get you accustomed
to some of the industry in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a very good job with a diverse
agricultural publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Vegetable Growers News is
another good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look in the classified ads for
equipment, but also get a good idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the world of
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing too is just get
to meetings and talk to other growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be one of your best
sources of information, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we've said this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've gone over this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you need to really have a good
idea of what scale you want to farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: then put a system into place to make your
life easier in determining what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be going in a particular field,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you need to think about your labor
and mechanize where you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you purchase equipment, make sure
that it's appropriate for your size,
[SPEAKER_01]: operation, and also for your current
tractor that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't purchase those implements that
obviously can't be handled by your tractor
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're just way too big or too small
for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have seen that happen where you
just, for whatever reason, it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of machinery you bought is too small
for your tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got tire hangover marks or could
be a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think more importantly, or most
important, is don't be afraid to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about the equipment you're
thinking of purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dealers, in my experience,
most of them are very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know their equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't know it, they can find out
more information about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do think that a good
equipment salesman will follow through
[SPEAKER_01]: from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even to the degree where if you buy
that machinery from somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially used, you should be able to
still ask him questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, and we didn't put it
back in here, but make sure you find a
[SPEAKER_01]: good mechanic and a machinist if you need
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need one to make your life a lot
easier when it comes to repairs on this
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope it was somewhat useful for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions, obviously this is a
recorded version, so you won't be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask me directly in this, but you are more
than welcome to drop me an email at C as
[SPEAKER_01]: in Charles, D as in David, B as in Boy,
13, so C, D, B, 1, 3, 13, at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can also ask those questions to
Crystal and Laura, and they can forward
[SPEAKER_01]: them to me, and I can answer them back for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your evening,
and take care.
Thank you.
