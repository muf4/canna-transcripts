[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm setting my timer for 30
minutes so that I'm sure that I have
[SPEAKER_04]: enough time for us to chat afterwards and
we'll see how quickly I flow through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I sat back to think about what we
would talk about today, I realized that
[SPEAKER_04]: the past five years have been sort of a
stream of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep trying new things and spreading
out and branching.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my goal for the day is to take you on
this journey with us that we've gone on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at any point, if you have a question,
feel free to throw it in the chat so that
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't forget it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe we can talk about it at the
end.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you need clarification,
if I'm going too fast, if I'm using an
[SPEAKER_04]: acronym, that isn't familiar to everybody,
then by all means, feel free to shout out
[SPEAKER_04]: and stop me as I'm going.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is essentially going to be
storytelling time for all intents and
[SPEAKER_04]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to throw a whole lot of pictures
at you and just describe what we've
[SPEAKER_04]: learned as we've went along.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been involved with a lot of the
horticultural production until really I
[SPEAKER_04]: would say this past year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more my colleague, Kelly Hennigan,
but we work as a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll let you know a bit about what
we've done and where we've come.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's begin.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see if my computer
cooperates with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first went to write this
presentation, I set up the slides for each
[SPEAKER_04]: of the years, and I realized about 15
minutes into it that I was off by 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years, that I had written 1996,
1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently, I'm stuck in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I fixed it and realized,
oh, no, we started growing in 2016,
[SPEAKER_04]: not 1996.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was our inaugural hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were partners with JD Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at their farm, we grew 30 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our goal was really we thought that
grain was going to be the low-hanging
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were going to focus on grain
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said we don't really know so much about
grain production when it comes to an
[SPEAKER_04]: organic farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And JD Farm is an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our research focus was looking at can
we meet the nutrient requirements for this
[SPEAKER_04]: crop using different combinations of
manures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we figured we would just compare yield
between them as our first go and see how
[SPEAKER_04]: we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the craziest year for importing
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first time around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had no idea what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting the seed took way longer than we
thought it was going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shipping company, when they figured
out what they were shipping, so we ordered
[SPEAKER_04]: our seed from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it almost made it to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made it to Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the shipping company realized
what they were shipping and wouldn't take
[SPEAKER_04]: it a foot further.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had to drive to Syracuse with
police escort to pick up the seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: sign for it, and drive it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had to have police watch the
seed so that none of it was stolen between
[SPEAKER_04]: the time when we received it until the
time it got in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't get planted until July 4th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So year one was what we thought was a late
start.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get planted until July 4th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hired a local grain farmer to
custom harvest for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had no idea what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really steep learning curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had no idea what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we figured let's all learn together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being the first crop, everybody wanted
to get in on pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though we planted with a green
drill, as you can see here, this is Dan
[SPEAKER_04]: Dolgen and Mark Just from JD Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were all planted a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is me and my kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all planted a few seeds by hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the truck we had to go pick up
the seed on and the police escorted back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was quite an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though our research question was
all about nutrients, we learned a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit about pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that first year, we learned a whole
lot about weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that although we were hearing lots of
people in the surrounding communities talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about they were concerned that cannabis
sativa would become the next major field
[SPEAKER_04]: crop weed, what we were learning was that
this plant cannot outcompete our weed
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had heard horror stories from Kentucky
about how devastating Japanese beetles
[SPEAKER_04]: could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were really nervous when we
started to see some Japanese beetles on
[SPEAKER_04]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we realized was that they were
mostly hanging out on the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a little bit, the weed species in the
field were acting as trap crops because
[SPEAKER_04]: they were preferring being on the pigweed
around the hemp than they were on the
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was sort of interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started learning a little bit about
seed production and we saw that what it
[SPEAKER_04]: meant for this crop to be indeterminate
and the fact that we have our seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: maturing unevenly throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This first year, we had so many people
want to come visit the fields and take
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody, we had horticultural
classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had ag classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had administrators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone wanted to come and take a selfie
in the hemp fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here we can see the unevenness of
grain production.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're up the top here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could see the seeds are brown and
drying out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the bottom, right, there's still
green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first year was, oh, well,
if we're going to treat this like other
[SPEAKER_04]: grain crops, when we harvest our other
grain crops, we wait for the seed to dry
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were waiting for our seed to dry
before we came through and harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in another piece of this picture,
you can see the lamb's quarter here along
[SPEAKER_04]: the side and next to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is easily as tall as the hemp plants
that were in this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so in year one, we learned a lot about
crop variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left-hand side is a picture of me
standing up, looking down at the crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably about up to my knee.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right-hand side is me stretching my
arm up to reach the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe that, I don't know,
I'm five foot three and a half on a good
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that's almost five foot ten,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not quite a six foot crop there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we saw a whole lot of variability in
terms of height, in terms of the size of
[SPEAKER_04]: the seed head, and in terms of the
thickness of our stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we learned in this first year had
a lot to do with what we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's to be expected, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first time we had ever grown this
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really exciting to learn how many
things we didn't know because from a
[SPEAKER_04]: research perspective, that just makes you
say, hey, what can we ask questions about?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we figure that means that we're going
to be busy for the next couple of years,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Gives us something to work on,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, this was a field that was divided
into quadrants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was half that had pig bedded pack,
half that had beef bedded pack manure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one side had poultry litter added
it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were looking at combinations of
manures there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, we couldn't compare the data
in these quadrants, the yields,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the weed pressure was so great
that any differences that we saw were
[SPEAKER_04]: mostly because of the differences in types
of weeds that we saw in the field there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a learning experience and fun
to harvest.
So that's what we learned in the second
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see if we can go that way anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any second now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So year two.
[SPEAKER_04]: In year two, we said, OK, we're focusing
on green, or maybe we can figure out a
[SPEAKER_04]: dual purpose for using the fiber here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to dial in our nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were starting a small plot study
on campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say small, it was like a
quarter of an acre, a really small plot
[SPEAKER_04]: study on campus to do in collaboration
with what we were doing with JD Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were sort of creating our grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state had now allowed farms to have
their own permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then in late May, early June,
the governor pushed to have even more
[SPEAKER_04]: acres in production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we threw 40 acres in on campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't our original intention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was our opportunity to try out
a couple of different varieties and really
[SPEAKER_04]: just get it growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because trying to get seed that late in
the game, we ended up not planting until
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere around July 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you remember, the first year we planted
July 4, July 20, was when we got those
[SPEAKER_04]: extra acres in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was a little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hired that same local grain farmer
to custom harvest for us, other than the
[SPEAKER_04]: small quarter acre of plots, which I like
to say, my darling slave labor,
[SPEAKER_04]: otherwise known as my students,
you get a good grade for putting in some
[SPEAKER_04]: blood, sweat, and tears.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they were in charge of doing all of
the hand harvesting of my plots and
[SPEAKER_04]: separating out the grain from those plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love them dearly for all their hard
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things that we learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp doesn't like poorly drained or
excessively wet soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the banner description of year
number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have poorly drained soil,
you have poorly established hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried over and over and over to
establish in June of that year our small
[SPEAKER_04]: quarter acre trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to plant it three times because of
how wet it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a field where you can see where it
dries out on this line.
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire field was planted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of the field in the wet area did
not emerge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see here, there's sort of a
lake in the middle of this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: June 2018 was really wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hemp does not like poorly drained or
excessively wet soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the quarter acre trial
plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the flags.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would have been the plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just had to keep trying and keep
trying and keep trying to establish
[SPEAKER_04]: because there was so much water.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to see my kids in the first
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my son the second year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to show them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the progression of how
they've grown along with the crops
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the field where we were
supposed to be going through and counting
[SPEAKER_04]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, we were just trying to decide
when we were going to try and replant
[SPEAKER_04]: again because it was so wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So July 7 was the third time that we
planted there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, again, two weeks later was when
we planted the rest of our fields on
[SPEAKER_04]: campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which we decided it wasn't worth doing a
nitrogen rate trial because it was too
[SPEAKER_04]: late.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even think we were going to get
a crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the things that we learned this
year, the second year, we learned a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: about fusarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: We learned a bit about white mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw that there are definitely pests in
our area that are going to impact the
[SPEAKER_04]: crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw that if hemp emerges after a weed
species, that it can't out compete.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the hemp emerges before a weed
species and is able to establish,
[SPEAKER_04]: then it does a whole lot better at
managing weed competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw lots more variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these two pictures are the same field
where this student is about my height and
[SPEAKER_04]: the crop is up to her shoulders,
whereas 100 yards away.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that same field, the crop is,
this student is a little bit taller than
[SPEAKER_04]: me, but is up to her waist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're seeing just so much variability
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is the field next to this
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though this picture is taken a
month later, you're not getting much more
[SPEAKER_04]: growth after flower establishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the fact that this student is six
foot one, so the fact that we have this
[SPEAKER_04]: tremendous growth here, it shows us how
much variability there is within the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows us how much breeding work there
is to be done to pick out the traits that
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to help us get whether or not we
want a shorter crop for grain production
[SPEAKER_04]: or a taller crop for fiber production,
that we need to see what are the ways that
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics can influence crop production
versus what are the environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: influences of crop production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many questions to ask, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year for the growing season,
we would just find out so many more
[SPEAKER_04]: questions that we would set out to answer
one thing and then find 15 more questions
[SPEAKER_04]: that were like, oh, well, before we can
answer this, we need to know these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a little bit of work of indoor
grows, looking at microgreens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is this push for, extracts
production, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_04]: we thought, well, what are some other
horticultural ways of growing this crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: And can hemp microgreen compete in the
microgreens market?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we found was that
while its taste and palatability were
[SPEAKER_04]: really great, we couldn't compete with
California, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason that the majority of
microgreens are grown in large-scale
[SPEAKER_04]: horticultural production and not in small
boutique farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just too expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we realized growing for extracts is not
the only horticultural hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing for microgreens was really
successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby farms had a line of microgreens in
Whole Foods in the city for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they've stopped doing that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly because it's just too hard to keep
up with the cost of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that brings us to year three,
2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2018, we grew a little bit and started
taking on partner farms around the state
[SPEAKER_04]: and expanding our nitrogen trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really were focusing mainly on grain
production with a little bit of fiber in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, but mainly grain production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just nitrogen rates for answering the
questions of nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really weren't trying to answer the
questions for phosphorus and potassium
[SPEAKER_04]: quite yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just focusing on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a whole lot of drought in June
that year and then it got really cold and
[SPEAKER_04]: August through October were super wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the combination of those things made
the growing season a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hired that same local grain farmer to
come harvest for us, but that was the last
[SPEAKER_04]: time that we did that because we realized
that we were trying to fit a square peg
[SPEAKER_04]: into a round hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, a lot of people talk about horror
stories about harvesting hemp for grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the problem is more trying to use
something outfitted for soybeans for hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: or something outfitted for wheat for hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we took something outfitted for
soybeans and tried to harvest corn,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'd destroy the machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awful, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing good would come of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same thing that the issue
isn't the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue is that we don't have the
equipment specified to the crop that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, over the years, we've gotten better
at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we found was that this farmer
that was harvesting for us wasn't willing
[SPEAKER_04]: to learn from the things that we were
learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you always do what you've always
done, you always get what you always got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was getting angrier and angrier
at the hemp harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were getting angrier and angrier
that what we were learning wasn't being
[SPEAKER_04]: implemented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so putting those two things together,
we said it is time for us to get our own
[SPEAKER_04]: combine because we need to show folks that
this isn't as horrible as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the biggest problems with the hemp
industry, I'll say in New York state,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it probably applies elsewhere,
is lack of good information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more than lack of good information,
prevalence of bad information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have all these people telling
stories about terrible things that
[SPEAKER_04]: happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And scaring folks off who say,
well, I have enough problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need that on my plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of saying, oh, no, no,
no, look, we're learning how to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we're learning how to do this
better, look, now is the time to get
[SPEAKER_04]: involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to counteract the storyline of
hemp is nothing but a problem child.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in 2018, that was our last year of
working with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some of the nitrogen rates that
we set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were looking to see how does nitrogen
impact growth and what is the best
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen rate for this crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we found was with
poor nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, I guess, makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our crop isn't able to combat weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in our zero nitrogen rates and in
our 50 pound nitrogen rates, although not
[SPEAKER_04]: so much in this field because there was
leaching from the strips around it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but certainly over here, we saw horrible
weed pressure that we just didn't see in
[SPEAKER_04]: the rest of the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the balance of ensuring proper
fertility will make sure that our crop can
[SPEAKER_04]: then outcompete the species, the weed
species that are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started dabbling in NDVI imaging,
and it was really interesting for us
[SPEAKER_04]: because our goal was to see if NDVI
imaging could be used for determining if
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen applications are necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here, after looking at that
previous map, you can see our low rates,
[SPEAKER_04]: our lower rates here and our low rates
here, and then our high rates in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more green, the more foliage there is,
the more red, the more brown,
[SPEAKER_04]: or soil is being reflected back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, this is at the end of July.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here we're looking at October 5th.
[SPEAKER_04]: NDVI is Normalized Difference Vegetative
Index.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it means is you're taking an
infrared image and that the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: infrared light that's reflected back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is essentially a scale that shows
you how much is being reflected back.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a lot of light being reflected
back, it means it's not being absorbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that there's no plant
material there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those redder areas are the lots is
being reflected back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The green areas is lots more absorption,
and the yellow is the scale in between the
[SPEAKER_04]: green and the red.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what was really interesting for us is
the difference between the July image and
[SPEAKER_04]: the October image.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still see those strips a little
bit, but you've sort of lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason you've lost it is because
as the seeds mature, they're brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're going to turn brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be reflecting that light
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we started thinking, oh,
well, maybe this imaging isn't just useful
[SPEAKER_04]: for nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this imaging might be useful for
harvest readiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a thought we had there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, every time we try and set out to
answer a question, we get six more new
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing that was really
interesting was in this field,
[SPEAKER_04]: the left side of the field was one variety
and the right by the field was the other
[SPEAKER_04]: variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually wrote it backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Felina 32 side, and this is
the Anka side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at the end of June, there was very
little that was established.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the end of July, we really see a strong
difference between these two varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the October image,
again, we can't see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we're ready for the harvest readiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: This field didn't get harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was so much moisture in the later
part of the summer and early part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: fall that coordinating with our person to
come harvest, we were sort of the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the importance list.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being very diplomatic about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And therefore our crop didn't get
harvested on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of September, there was,
let's see if that's gonna let me,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need to get back to my pointer
to be able, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end of September, there was this
horrible windstorm and the crop was more
[SPEAKER_04]: than ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that shaking and all of that
wind essentially put all of our seed on
[SPEAKER_04]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the farmer came to harvest this
field and instead of getting between
[SPEAKER_04]: probably seven and 800 pounds of grain per
acre in this field, he was getting 80
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds of grain per acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just gave up and said, it's not worth
your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not worth my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that field didn't end up getting
harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we weren't able to compare the
yield results between those two varieties,
[SPEAKER_04]: which would have been really lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we did see was the importance of
harvesting on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we learned that the harvest window for
hemp is really narrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once that seed starts to dry out,
it really falls off really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so harvest readiness is an incredibly
important characteristic to pay attention
[SPEAKER_04]: to when we're dealing with grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're dealing with fiber as well,
I guess when we're dealing with extract as
[SPEAKER_04]: well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowing that window is really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we harvested the fiber with a
sickle bar mower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, we were on the
slope a little bit and there was wind and
[SPEAKER_04]: the fiber was falling into the standing
crop there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my job was to follow the sickle bar and
take armfuls of the fiber and toss it so
[SPEAKER_04]: that we can come through and get the next
big swath cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was more exercise than I think I've
ever gotten in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the very end of it, when there was
just one armful left, there was a surprise
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting for us in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a skunk who had just walked out
of its little hole and surprise saw us
[SPEAKER_04]: turn around, lifted its tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had just been throwing these huge
piles of hemp so that we can come through
[SPEAKER_04]: and cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if nothing else, that was a study on
the benefit of adrenaline because I
[SPEAKER_04]: sprinted across that field faster than
I've ever run in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the skunk got the sickle bar,
but nothing else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the skunk's tail is in that field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been told that that tail was then
collected and preserved, but I still
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was our first year of actually
harvesting for fiber though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were learning a little bit about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we did after that
was add this little triangle to the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the sickle bar to make sure that fiber
tips in the right direction and doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: fall on the crop before it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of this had to be picked up and
thrown so that we can continue to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we let it ret in the field and
raked it with a rotary rake and then came
[SPEAKER_04]: through and round bailed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were looking for dumbness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So totally different focus then with our
grain here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to see the vast fibers starting to
pull away from the herd.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want an evenness in color.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want too much of this dark black
here with this light here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want it to be much more even there,
but this was our first year and our first
[SPEAKER_04]: go round at it, our first trial of running
in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2019, we were set to do that better
and decided that we were really going to
[SPEAKER_04]: split our acres of half grain and half
fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've also been hearing a lot
about, can we do a dual purpose with
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have to do our extracts production
in a horticultural style or can we do it
[SPEAKER_04]: in the field crop style, which is sort of
how they do it more commonly in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried a study of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our horticulture department did our
first outdoor grow for our high CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're again focusing on those nitrogen
rate trials, focusing on organic versus
[SPEAKER_04]: inorganic amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oops, that was 2018 drought for 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened to 2019 weather wise?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 2019 was the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an okay growing season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can that be 20 minutes already?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know I have 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that year we found ourselves a 1973
ish international combine and took us a
[SPEAKER_04]: little while to get it on hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we harvested a little bit later than we
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ended up doing a bit of harvesting
by hand just to be able to compare our
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen rate trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really exciting for us to have a
combine of our own and be able to show
[SPEAKER_04]: that this was going to be a successful
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did a little bit different this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had fewer nitrogen rates that we did in
strips in one field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the field across from it,
all four quadrants received manure in the
[SPEAKER_04]: winter and early spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then A and B were top dressed at our
medium rate as our inorganic field across
[SPEAKER_04]: the way from it was to see if that
combination of organic and inorganic
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments was better than just the
organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we also had A and D were one
variety and B and C were another variety
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're seeing really large
differences between varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that this is the way that that map
was set up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show you a couple of NDVI
images now of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also we do reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really no till.
[SPEAKER_04]: We run an airway through some of our
fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's lots of cover on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we were finding was that if
there's far too much cover on the ground,
[SPEAKER_04]: you get really poor emergence.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with just a moderate amount of cover
on the ground, our emergence was no
[SPEAKER_04]: different than if our than if our field
was bare.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was sort of fun for us to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also saw this is a field after that
was conventionally tilled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was the that was
conventionally tilled and they planted in
[SPEAKER_04]: that same night.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a huge rainstorm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after that huge rainstorm, you get this
surface rusting and you'll see the only
[SPEAKER_04]: places where the hemp actually came up are
in cracks within that surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really saw the importance of
planning of planting time, particularly in
[SPEAKER_04]: a conventionally tilled soil where you can
get these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were just learning left and right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything we did was was we were learning
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is the image of September 3rd.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're comparing this image is just
your regular RGB, your regular picture
[SPEAKER_04]: that you could take with your phone as
opposed to a picture that you can take
[SPEAKER_04]: with the infrared camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the naked eye, you can see the
difference between what was top dressed
[SPEAKER_04]: and what wasn't, which is sort of
interesting, but it's really not as easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to see the difference between the
varieties as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they showed us that this field was
too small for our strips because there was
[SPEAKER_04]: leaching in between our different nitrogen
rates except for this back area here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That area with the low nitrogen rate,
you can really see the difference with the
[SPEAKER_04]: naked eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need an infrared camera for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see a little bit more detail
with that infrared camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also did a study partnering with a
private company to test their product to
[SPEAKER_04]: see if their metabolism booster could take
a European CBD variety, which means that
[SPEAKER_04]: in Europe, if a crop produces 3% CBD,
it's considered a CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took a European CBD variety and
sprayed it with their, I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: another one of them getting that my
students a year ago getting the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sprayer ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we sprayed it with this metabolism
booster to see how that would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some issues that year with,
well, this special variety that we bought
[SPEAKER_04]: took an extra month to get here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we planted late and because we planted
late, the weeds came back after killing
[SPEAKER_04]: what was in that field with ground up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't get the research results that
we wanted to from that field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we redid it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This year in the greenhouse, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to harvest with our own combine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the modifications to this combine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a really great learning
experience for us to see what has to be
[SPEAKER_04]: modified and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only had one small fire and that was
easily doused.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a student walking behind the
combine, just checking to make sure that
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is flowing out of it smoothly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our fiber harvest, this is the video
that folks growing for extracts hate to
[SPEAKER_04]: see because as that fiber falls,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the clouds of pollen coming
out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The appropriate time to harvest for fiber
is before the females have been
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinated, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want the male plants to die yet
because the male plants will die after
[SPEAKER_04]: they release the pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise you lose half of your fiber crop
if you let the male plants die.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the female plants, once they're
pollinated, the fiber quality changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the right time to harvest,
which means there was a lot of wind that
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of pollen moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you can see, this is not a flat
landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: How far that pollen will travel?
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that Cornell is doing a really
good job of answering that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But truly not as far as folks worry,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see that's a whole lot of
pollen coming out of that crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the crop was falling straight the
way that it needed to because we have that
[SPEAKER_04]: little triangle on the end of,
oops, that's not what I want, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, in the field, we did much better
in the second year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a much more even red.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we bailed that fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in our first year, we had a little
trouble with the round baler.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our second year, we learned that we
needed to just do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: protecting here of the wires that go from
the tractor to the baler.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once those are protected, everything
else went smoothly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was a really good example of
where you have these terrible stories of
[SPEAKER_04]: doing thousands of dollars of damage to
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you were like, oh, well,
this wasn't hard to fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now it's not a problem anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2020, we didn't grow for grain
because it's 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew what was going to happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I didn't want to set up grain
trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I had two student interns.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wasn't exactly positive if I was
going to be able to have them for the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went through the easy route and
we decided that fiber was the easy way to
[SPEAKER_04]: go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were focusing, instead of on different
nitrogen rates, we were focusing on,
[SPEAKER_04]: could we see a difference in using a
leguminous cover crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we looked at cow peas and we looked
at alfalfa, or sorry, not cover crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: inter crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also partnered with Beacon Skip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were doing a large CBD grow this
year and let us come in and take soil
[SPEAKER_04]: samples and take plant samples throughout
the growing season to see if we can track
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulation of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a lot of talk of hemp as a
heavy metal produce or hyper accumulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the words I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was our opportunity to get
into that space and see if that's true for
[SPEAKER_04]: two reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, because if you're producing an
extract, would that extract with heavy
[SPEAKER_04]: metals and it then become problematic?
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, to prove whether or not it really
does hyper accumulate heavy metals and can
[SPEAKER_04]: it be used for phytoremediation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, there was a lot of drought this June.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though we planted on time,
maybe a week late, our crop didn't emerge
[SPEAKER_04]: until July because there was just no rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went through and hand harvested
the plots that we wanted to, but really we
[SPEAKER_04]: just sickle barred and let the crop lay in
the field because it just wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was too dry a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see how big my kids gotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't he cute?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is at the Beacon Skip field.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their CBD grow looked really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is our fiber field on the day it
was being harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is probably the best part of the
field where my laser pointer is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about between five and six foot tall,
but this right here is only three foot
[SPEAKER_04]: tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was quite a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also did a repeat of the metabolism
booster study, but we did it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here you can see a major pest
problem that we saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're waiting to get our data back
about extracts because we noted that there
[SPEAKER_04]: were plants that were invested and there
were a couple of hundred plants right on
[SPEAKER_04]: top of each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they weren't all infested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we wanted to see if whether the
amount of cannabinoids being produced has
[SPEAKER_04]: something to do with whether or not the
plants were covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is going to be another one of
our questions of does extract
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration has something to do with
resistance to pest pressure?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this was just today in lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had students doing an olive oil
extraction process just to see that there
[SPEAKER_04]: are quite a few different ways of
extracting cannabinoids and terpenes from
[SPEAKER_04]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll then go through a distillation
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what have we learned?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've learned about weed management.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've learned that we need breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Cornell, for all the work
you're doing in breeding because man,
[SPEAKER_04]: are there a lot of traits that we're not
sure what's being controlled by genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's being controlled by environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the environmental factors and how
do those two come together?
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that getting nutrient management
correct is vital, not just for yield,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also for competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really hard because so far each
growing season we've had a but because the
[SPEAKER_04]: weather has really interfered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pest pressure has really been all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what's most important to me
and the biggest take home message for me
[SPEAKER_04]: is that there is so much variability here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're growing for extracts,
you also have a fiber crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're growing for a fiber crop,
maybe that there's also extract potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're growing for grain,
what are you going to do with that
[SPEAKER_04]: leftover fiber?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we need to know what is your focus
for your crop and then where's your crop
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go?
[SPEAKER_04]: And before a seed or a clone goes in the
ground, we need to know where that's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to go to because our supply chain needs
work.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of shysters in the
extract world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you got to be careful with who
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no such thing as a waste
product that we can develop this supply
[SPEAKER_04]: chain better.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is so much potential for usable
portions of this crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is still a lot of bad
information out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the community at large needs to
understand that this is a crop just like
[SPEAKER_04]: any other crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my funding sources have been sort of
all across the board throughout the past
[SPEAKER_04]: five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'm happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start with the question, Jen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for a fascinating seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so glad that you were able to outrun
that skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite stories so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing how fast we can run when
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question for you is anytime you're
growing a cannabis crop, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: security issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a college campus, how does one
alert the public that what you are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: is a crop that does not have THC
potential?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I started with signs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went to all of the professors
who taught first year experience courses
[SPEAKER_04]: so that all of the freshmen would hear the
this is hemp for grain and fiber,
[SPEAKER_04]: not anything that's going to get you high
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went to the student senate and
talked to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it really is a lot of word of
mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because there are a lot of ag students
on campus, they were able to do some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the smacking of the head for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there were definitely students who
went into the field our first two years
[SPEAKER_04]: and grabbed samples and tried to sell
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, I can do as much education
as I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they just have to learn on their
own that they're being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all about using my resources on
campus, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you were very thorough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see if Larry Smart has a
question given the work that he's doing on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
Larry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks very much for giving that excellent
seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm curious about your modification
on the sickle bar mower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made some modifications to our
sickle bar bar more, but we don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: baler.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't done that large scale fiber
production that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you describe that a little bit
more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Larry, it is so simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally a wooden triumph.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so if this is the sickle bar,
the triangle and then my tractors over
[SPEAKER_04]: here, the triangle comes out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's angled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of being like this,
it's angled like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the sickle bar pushes through the
crop, it's pulling the crop back towards
[SPEAKER_04]: the tractor to fall instead of falling
back into the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was just the simplest addition
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That second year, our crop was also a
little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we don't know if that was part of
the reason that it fell so nicely also.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seemed and this year, I don't
really want to talk about our field this
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were so sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to see next year if it works
as well again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a really simple change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions for Jen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I know this isn't exactly up the
alley of most of the horticulture program
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're focused more on the indoor
grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really think there is a lot of
overlap and a lot of collaboration between
[SPEAKER_04]: the different styles of production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don, maybe just one more quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen, you said you grew some new crosses
this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you can you describe those a little
bit more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So last year, they grew Berry Blossom and
Felina 32 and they crossed them so that we
[SPEAKER_04]: had a Berry Blossom Felina 32 cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of being tree style,
it was much more erect and upright.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I actually just sent those out for
cannabinoid analysis yesterday and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: we're curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that stays upward of seven or eight
percent, if that becomes a way of being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to grow field crop production style
instead of horticultural production style,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that could be cut with a combine
and separated out as opposed to some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the more labor intensive handways or the
ways that we're doing under plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but you got that from Kailin and Dan?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we did it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, we did it ourselves last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that that we had a student last
year whose family donated about 100 seed
[SPEAKER_04]: suss of a bunch of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where we got the high CBD
varieties from to start with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did, you know, our board
department has been teaching a lot about
[SPEAKER_04]: propagation and breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they did that cross and then grew
it out in the field this year to see how
[SPEAKER_04]: it would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Structure wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any final questions for Jen before we
finish up, Thomas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your final point there with the growers
need to know who's buying what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing before they even plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of a common problem when field
crop growers get into any horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one's more challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious what the sense was among
the growers that you are working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they have some sense of who is
going to be buying it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they figure it would work itself out
in the meantime, or were there already
[SPEAKER_02]: buyers that they just show up like you do
to a grain elevator?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a couple of growers that were
planning on processing themselves that had
[SPEAKER_04]: ideas about producing their own hemp oil
and so harvesting the grain to press for
[SPEAKER_04]: oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the most common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't need to worry about a buyer
because I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is such a different way of thinking
that you don't ever worry about being able
[SPEAKER_04]: to sell corn or soybeans or oats a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not make money at it, but you can
always sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is a two-sided
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that there is the field crop
producers who aren't used to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two is the other side of hemp
production, there are a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people who have never grown a thing in
their life who all of a sudden were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be a farmer because hemp is
legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not that our fruit and veg farmers
are all jumping on board because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: right, that is part of that production
model where you have to know where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was more different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did get at least both of those
audiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the new farm, the not experienced

[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm afraid we've run out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jen, this has been just delightful and
informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are so pleased and appreciative
that you were willing to share today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
