[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stunned by the turnout here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I will do your expectations
justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Angela got in contact with me,
she asked for something that would
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate discussion, and obviously would
have something to do with soils and carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general thrust that I chose is this
old thing that we all learn at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of our scientific careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is this mantra that is very
early in our scientific education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the data look good, but always be
mindful that you need to have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I use this as the framework
for what I actually want to get across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to tell you that you need
to be careful with correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may look like I was going to do that
over the next, let me say, five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't fall into that trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the talk about carbon
cycling is replete with the use of this
[SPEAKER_00]: word, control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it pays to think for a moment what a
control is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you want to know what a word
means, you go to the dictionary,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, then you find that a
control is defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's defined as the power to make
decisions, or the ability to direct
[SPEAKER_00]: actions, or an action itself, or a method,
a law that limits the amount or growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a control is perceived as something
that is actively doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we accept this choice of definitions,
then we are immediately aware of the
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively complicated nature of this
thing, control.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have actions, decisions,
methods, laws, abilities, then we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: accept that this entity, this concept of
control, is variable, dynamic,
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive, structured, multifaceted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on if I put a little effort
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm trying to get across here is
controls are not single numeric values.
[SPEAKER_00]: One number is not a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a sequence of numbers is not a
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even simple mathematical functions or
algorithms do not qualify as controls,
[SPEAKER_00]: always when you follow that
Merriam-Webster definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's try to find the connection
back to carbon cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about carbon cycling and
when they model carbon cycling,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they often use controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the interesting development that they
multiply over the years, or the controls
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being talked about increase in
number, we can broadly distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental controls, which include
drivers such as moisture, precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat is a form of radiation, but there's
also visible light, ultraviolet light,
[SPEAKER_00]: high energy radiation that might be
ionizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure of the environment can be
parameterized as total pore space,
[SPEAKER_00]: pore size distribution, preferential flow
paths, mineral surface chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these are environmental factors
that are known to have an influence on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the oxygen away, and things slow
down dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternate electron acceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the oxygen away, but you provide
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things keep going, at least for a
larger part of the microbial community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proton concentration, in other words,
for pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalytic metals, organic metals,
organic co-metabolites that will return
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral-borne nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something in the order of 11 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substrate controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this refers to the fact that the object
of decomposition has certain properties
[SPEAKER_00]: which tend to be of relevance for the
decomposition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which are these properties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bio-energetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much energy is stored in that organic
molecule?
[SPEAKER_00]: How attractive is it from an energy
viewpoint to the decomposer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidation state of the carbon,
mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important variable that
determines how difficult it is to get at
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, we are not just decomposing
things for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not us and not the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sometimes need nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, the stoichiometry of the
nutrients is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not just for the big ones,
the big mass nutrients, but also for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assimilability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your compound may be loaded with
energy, contain tons of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it may have some other feature that
prevents it from being assimilated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One really important number here is
molecular size.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go above 600 Dalton, we get into
real problems getting this compound
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cell wall, from the outside to
the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way these things are done in
nature means that thread-like molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: are much easier to take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everything's a thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we mean with
assimilability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And parametric expressions of
assimilability can be aqueous solubility,
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular size, linearity, globular
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these features influence control,
organic matter turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it far removed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moved from the decomposer or is it
close by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it co-precipitated with a mineral phase
kind of mired in concrete?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it adsorbed, encapsulated in an
aggregate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another dozen or so individual
controls that we know have the power to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the turnover of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organismic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decomposers, those who are actually
doing the business, they have different
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grazers, predators, mycorrhizal,
free-living fungi, bacteria, archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is dominating the microbial community?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of them are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How active are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they all dormant or are they competing
with each other massively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they synergistic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they cheaters?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is such a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who lie in wait for others to
secrete all the expensive enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology of microbes and especially the
chemistry of the extracellular polymeric
[SPEAKER_00]: substances that they secrete change as a
function of growth stage within hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability to use oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our second most electronegative
element in the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the strongest electron catcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a system that contains
oxygen, you can make these large energy
[SPEAKER_00]: gradients that really drive things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you cannot take advantage of this
and your energy gradient is only like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, such as between your substrate and
iron, for example, then the energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can harvest is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want to have things turn
over quickly, you want to have oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is reflected in the biology of
the decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are really specialized on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But others, once in a while, we run out of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have those who are absolutely
unable to deal with oxygen, organisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably are somewhat left over from the
days 2 or 3 billion years ago when there
[SPEAKER_00]: was no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's all kinds of integrates
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have here is something in the
order of 30 or if we were to engage in a
[SPEAKER_00]: collective brainstorm, we would be able to
come up with another 10 or 20 within 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenge then is how do we
constrain this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who or what controls the control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a hierarchy of relevance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they depend on each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the control number 7 of the same
importance in Cornell as it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Corvallis and in the respective soils,
of course?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how have people dealt with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are not the first who realized
this multitude of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So others before us have realized the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have developed strategies how to
deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the strategies was the idea to
look for a master control for one
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter or for one item that controls it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one ring, the first big popular
one ring is what we call substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first suggestion of a useful
master control that was extensively tested
[SPEAKER_00]: by the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm presenting two examples for the
application of this principle of substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: quality in the function of a master
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have all at some point heard
something about humic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a paradigm, a still standing
paradigm that these humic substances tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to have old radiocarbon age because there
is a process that is called humification
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes them highly aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this then explains their resistance to
decomposition, which explains the high
[SPEAKER_00]: radiocarbon age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes back to a benchmark paper
published in 1967.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs a little explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a graph with age on this axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: High age is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,500 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are a bit small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So old carbon is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 1,500 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have an index for
aromaticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ratio of the light extinction
at 400 and 600 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of determining how many
aromatic compounds are in that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are high on this axis,
the aromaticity is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are high on this axis,
the carbon is old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the young carbon, or the young age,
is following this red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that age gets older as the aromaticity
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brown line goes down, but that means
the aromaticity increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was practicing this for a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I want to come back to my
little introductory remark about the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of correlation and our joint
love for correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all, when we see something correlate
like this, the age goes up when
[SPEAKER_00]: aromaticity goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we all love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really like this type of observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do then is we inadvertently
instantly invent a model, some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the explanation was
really plausible because we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatic rings require a lot of activation
energy to break them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes total sense for these two
parameters, age and aromaticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: to correlate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to demonstrate that they do
indeed causally generate this resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to decomposition, one would have to
demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually went one sentence ahead of
myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to mention that these ages
here, this is what we, in carbon cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: models, consider the passive pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have heard about the active,
the intermediate, or slow, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: passive pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what gave rise to this passive
pool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,500 years of turnover time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the issues with causality
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an accepted relationship,
and it is still an accepted model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of inference informs the
community land model, which is supported
[SPEAKER_00]: by NSF and DOE, and which is the basis of
climate modeling at this time as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the issue with causality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that the ideas behind the
correlations used in the existing CLM are
[SPEAKER_00]: not based on causality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decomposer organisms have no way to sense
how much 14C or 13C is in a glucose or in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lipid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot make a selection based on 14C
content or 13C content.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recognize the glucose or they
recognize the lipid, and then they decide
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they want to engage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So old age is not an argument for
stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It were an argument for stability if the
decomposer would have a mechanism to
[SPEAKER_00]: select for young versus old, which they
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go for chemical characteristic and
not for radiocarbon content or 13C
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi are absolutely capable of
decomposing condensed aromatic rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge literature, and I just did
not put it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just Google PA ages and fungi,
and you get 10,000 hits or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mechanistic assumptions behind that
little logical chain that I had on the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous slide are not corroborated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing or the third major
argument here is the early researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: were working in Canadian grassland soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grassland soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had an important piece of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they see this 14C age is a function of
aromaticity, and they don't know an
[SPEAKER_00]: important feature of these grassland soils
that we know today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is that feature?
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromaticity in these soils does not
come from whatever that humification
[SPEAKER_00]: process represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to be here, the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these grassland soils,
which are sown as soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all along somewhere between the
20th and the 50th parallel, actually a few
[SPEAKER_00]: down here in Argentina as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map using the FAO soil
systematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has the pheosomes, chernosomes,
castanosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These soils are broadly equivalent to
their soil taxonomy mollisoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grasslands, in their native state,
they burn regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that loads them up with black carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC means black carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study is based on 28 soil
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rigorously investigated with
radiocarbon and 13C markers for black
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find that there is something of
the line was not drawn here, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: something of a correlation between the
black carbon in grassland soils and the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon stock in these soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the takeaway message here is that
grassland soils contain between 1 and 5
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms of black carbon, which is more
or less a concentration of aromatic rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are facing a longstanding paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is abundant evidence that the
mechanistic underpinnings are no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was published by Rodionov in
2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's leave the slow pool, the
1,000-year pool, behind for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another example of this attempt
to use a master control to describe carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the paradigm that little
decomposition rate should be a function of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lignin-nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an absolute citation classic here,
Melillo et al., 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the work where it was shown
for the first time that the biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining after you expose litter for a
certain amount of time or let it
[SPEAKER_00]: decompose, the amount of litter that
remains after time x is a function of
[SPEAKER_00]: lignin-nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you have high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The litter is decomposed quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the inverse is little lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: High lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the litter goes away much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which leads to this general
paradigmatic statement that litter
[SPEAKER_00]: decompositions depends on lignin content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one caution that one should
immediately become aware of when one looks
[SPEAKER_00]: at this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is a categorical predictor,
then the green and the blue should be on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently, this relationship can be
modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we run into this issue with our
assumption that a master control may help
[SPEAKER_00]: us to get a handle on the multitude of
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, for whatever reason, I want to be able
to distinguish between ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently, just one control is not going
to carry the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, by the way, the
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental evidence that gave rise to
this idea that we should have a slow pool
[SPEAKER_00]: in carbon cycle models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this type of material turns over
on an annual, multi-annual time scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1020.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue with this is not only that the
green and the blue were not on top of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is also that this old
assumption, lignin is only decomposed
[SPEAKER_00]: after the labile or end-containing
organics have been used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this Berg and Staff,
1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: This litter decomposition model,
that you have the mass of the litter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue line, mass on this axis,
time on this axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time progresses, the litter comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mass comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the underlying idea, verbalized here,
was that the lignin doesn't respond until
[SPEAKER_00]: the labile stuff, which would be the area
under this curve here, until that is
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea, the bugs or decomposers go
for the easy stuff first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have used that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they eat the candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go for the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is somewhat plausible,
because it is in line with some of our own
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just was talking about the candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have evidence that processes of
this kind can work in this fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it actually what is going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is new research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows vigorous lignin decomposition
is going on only as long as there are
[SPEAKER_00]: these easily decomposable things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mass loss, now again, the litter
mass loss, the whole litter mass loss
[SPEAKER_00]: described by the blue line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lignin gets decomposed here at the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have these things in order to
help decompose the lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you run out of the accessory,
the so-called co-metabolites, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources to do business with the lignin
are no longer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the line flattens out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Published in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the old model, 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new evidence has come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both cases, it's not my intention to
criticize our predecessors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intention is rather to point at the
need to be careful with these
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't trust them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we do, we might miss the things
that are really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to point that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I believe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is substrate quality an appropriate
master control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, based on the evidence I have just
presented, I hope you can join me in
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that is probably not so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that is not so, then is there maybe
some other master control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we come to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published in 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: So large differences between the turnover
rate of particular compounds in liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial cultures, and in soil indicate
that soil provides a measurable degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those who set out to get a handle on
the controls focused on the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then somebody realized the soil
controls the matrix of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Controls decomposition as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have the substrate somewhere
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it matters what kind of matrix
this substrate interacts with,
[SPEAKER_00]: if at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, look at that date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of thinking came around more or
less at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the substrate control idea was way
more appealing to the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liked it much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really want to deal with this
matrix and mineral stuff for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until 1997, Margaret, my former boss,
was lucky with a nature paper that was
[SPEAKER_00]: titled Mineral Control of Soil Organic
Carbon Storage and Turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this then is an example for an attempt
to address some of the shortcomings that
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate quality idea had by
replacing it with a better master control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem with that approach was that it's
not exactly a straightforward predictor
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take mineral components from
three different soils, here this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: clay fraction, then you have to accept
that the ability of clays to associate
[SPEAKER_00]: with carbon is much different between the
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just say, which actually the
century model does, take clay content and
[SPEAKER_00]: use that as a rate modifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters a lot what kind of clay you
have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we make out of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: A contest of the master controls does not
seem to be the best strategy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, in the beginning,
I took some time to show that there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem to come up with at least 30 or 40
individual factors that would qualify as
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So picking one and focusing on one of
these controls is apparently not the best
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in both cases, the evidence in
support for the importance of that control
[SPEAKER_00]: was largely correlative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The researchers saw this correlation,
the lignin-nitrogen ratio and the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of litter left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out, do some experiments out there,
and you have 10 data points, and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It must mean something, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fascination with this type of
result then makes us so confident that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do not dig deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we doing enough to identify and
understand mechanisms and causes behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the assumptions that we use to inform
carbon cycle models?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm positing here we are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are the generation that has to
change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brings up the issue of causality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get at causality in carbon
cycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are ways to make this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the controls actually are descriptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that we need to understand,
we don't need another label.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need is understanding of the
system, the machine, the engine,
[SPEAKER_00]: reciprocating or turbine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of understanding is what we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good way to approach this,
or the way that I am proposing here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to look for where the soil comes from,
evolutionary adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number, relevance, connectivity of
controls, our catalog of 30 controls,
[SPEAKER_00]: can they be seen as a consequence of
systems design?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would have, if this in any way works
out, it would mean if you get an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the principles behind systems design,
how is the soil as a place where carbon is
[SPEAKER_00]: processed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that designed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it laid out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the guiding principles?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know that, we may be able to get at
the causalities that we are missing in
[SPEAKER_00]: these old correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm saying here is in disagreement
with the views that geologists have about
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geologists take soils as the interface
between a planetary body and what is
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do not require life to be
involved in the formation of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This understanding of soil, when I say
soil evolves with the ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: goes back to this idea of the burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure others as well have put forward
that when soil formation really took off
[SPEAKER_00]: on this planet, when plants started to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the algae came out of the water and
inhabited the land, that is the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: where we should start talking about soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we follow that premise, and again,
the geology community, folks who like to
[SPEAKER_00]: find soils on Mars, they have to do
without trees and out roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a different view of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution has created flow through reactor
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: With unique reactor design and carbon
processing strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be the key to causality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reactor design, carbon processing
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like 400 million years ago,
a few algae started to inhabit the land
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little algae evolved into proto
plants, which developed proto roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, by the way, from the first day were
working together with mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: and with bacteria, because they were there
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result, the matrix gets
transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you allow the plants to become
more complicated and more powerful as
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeochemical machines, then you get
these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is relatively easy to envision that
when you change the ecosystem here,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have effects on how the soil is
functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different quantities of inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have other biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a different type of reactor
design and different carbon processing
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That now means the controls are the result
of how the system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't approach the problem by asking,
what does temperature do to the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: You approach the problem by saying,
how does the system work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, if I raise the temperature to 50
degrees, that means such and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a reversal of the line of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basis for this is the fact that within
any ecosystem, there's coevolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground and below ground biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decomposers are there because of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the idea behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Heathwood et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science paper is only four or five
pages, but the supplementary information
[SPEAKER_00]: are, I believe, 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if soils evolved to decompose organic
carbon at the rates and in the sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: required to support the ecosystem,
that puts into question ideas like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I have a certain lignocellulose that
should decompose at a rate that is typical
[SPEAKER_00]: for lignocellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what our models do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 76 days, lignocellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the system has evolved to deal with
lignocellulose in a certain way,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the system determines, the
characteristics of the system determine
[SPEAKER_00]: how long this lignocellulose takes to be
decomposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no longer an inherent property of
the lignocellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So system evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a dune in beautiful Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Graz, Judent, Adrian,
Gallo taking a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only about 500 meters away from this
dune is an older dune.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see how that soil has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has shown some e-horizon, a bs horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an incipient spotter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very early anti-soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the course of this development,
there's change of the mineral matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minerals are destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: New minerals are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are rearranged in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reactor design, this is a different
reactor than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things that are happening
different here influence the turnover time
[SPEAKER_00]: of the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole matrix issue must be seen not
as a static entity, but as a dynamic,
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive part of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mineral matrix is actually shaped
by the biota, which is the major force
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes the soils function in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very crude idea of how this works is
you need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This water comes slightly acidic,
because you have CO2 in the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: which dissolves in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it mild acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then allows for weathering of the
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have small reactive weathering
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can be mineral particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are partners of mineral organic
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the intensity along this path varies
what you get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture also allows things to grow,
microbes and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when plants grow, for example,
they generate root exudates, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic, really acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that then augments or amplifies
processes down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more growing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more change here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make this a thriving, active part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, I have the bad word here,
humus, because it's in every book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be decomposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, again, making something
acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, then influences the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a highly dynamic system, you take
vegetation out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You change the intensity of processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mess with the microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You change the intensity of processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should illustrate the contention
that this is not very well predicted or
[SPEAKER_00]: described by saying lignin or cellulose
are decomposed within 50 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I change the importance of any of
these arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that number will not have any
connection with reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Current research practice is centered on
understanding controls and their
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, which can be paraphrased as
understand the control to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how we all have been brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how our modelers work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want us to figure out what how a
algorithm that describes how the control
[SPEAKER_00]: equation influences turnover time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But would it not be better if we accept
that controls and their relative
[SPEAKER_00]: importance evolve with a system to put
more effort into understanding systems
[SPEAKER_00]: design in a way that we can derive the
relative importance of controls for the
[SPEAKER_00]: governance of the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would turn the thing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to understand the importance of
the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are interested in temperature
sensitivity of organic matter decay,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you need to understand how decay
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will be able to understand
what happens when you manipulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we are approaching this right now
is from the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Systems design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are different, like I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Corvallis, we have different soils than
you guys have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an obvious difference between
soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within one soil, you can identify
regions where the process regime is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the litter layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a loose pile of substrate,
like walking into Starbucks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well aerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen, plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to come up with any fancy
physiology or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily accessible to mobile decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A force that we tend to forget very
frequently, mesophona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that chew the large
pieces down to the size where the bugs can
[SPEAKER_00]: then do bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are abundant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can crawl among the leaves and twigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are usually the first ones on the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Susceptible to perturbations and to
fluctuations of driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tree falls down, crashes on the fourth
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this little paradise is annihilated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it doesn't rain for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture holding capacity is basically
not existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ecological amplitudes are large.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need adaptations for that,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go a little further down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the region where you can
say the ecosystem does its recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the recycling facility of the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an active input of co-metabolites
through root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants, they have no interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant cannot think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an ecosystem does not evolve in a
direction chosen by the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you excuse my language when I say the
plants can support business by putting
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are regulatory mechanisms that allow
them to do that in an adaptive fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that as long as you have
these plant roots, fine roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really speed up things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have something that is adsorbed and
protected, or it's a large chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can support decomposition processes by
meta inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a wide choice of catabolic
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have access to catalytic metals and
reactive surfaces because you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that in the same extent
here in the litter layer, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the metals and you don't have
the minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oscillations in oxygen supply are
somewhat dampened because the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity is much higher than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a while, you go through a redox
cycle and you can recycle those redox
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive metals that you can utilize as
catalysts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only when you get down here, then you are
in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that qualifies as a completely
different operating condition for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low substrate concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of substrate here, a bit here,
a bit here, a bit here, and the microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this supposed to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do very quick organic meta
turnover under such conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of co-metabolites because no roots
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced pore space because often you have
clay formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: At those depths, and that will clog your
pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to get oxygen down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the issues of accessibility
that I just pointed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I mean with understanding
how the system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ask yourself now when I am,
let's say I am in this desert in the
[SPEAKER_00]: subsoil and I put a chunk of wood down
there, is it really appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it appropriate to say this turns over
in 76 days as a substrate specific
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our zeal to understand controls on
carbon cycling are relying too much on
[SPEAKER_00]: correlative evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progress may come from bottom-up
approaches that seek to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: causality that I am giving you here,
what you already heard in your first
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I really want to emphasize is it's
worth to accept the fact that soils do not
[SPEAKER_00]: just look different but also work
different, especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next generation of models and the next
generation of scientists needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasize the causalities behind the soil
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do the same thing that our fathers
have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see that straight line,
is that OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is certainly going to be a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be honest to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I really understand what's going on
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I tested whether my assumption is
really the mechanism behind this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I going the way of cheap sales?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're ever in a position to
support some sort of modeling exercise,
[SPEAKER_00]: be especially careful with the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causality thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A golden sentence to conclude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And paradigms must be continuously
challenged and checked for compliance with
[SPEAKER_00]: causalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't that read beautifully?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I need to admit that I'm not a
modeler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also need to admit that I have
enormous confidence in the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: technological advances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember that when I entered the
field 20 years ago, modeling exercises
[SPEAKER_00]: were done on supercomputers today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major constraints was storage
space at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand these constraints have
gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also remember that the computational
complexity of models was an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not knowing what the most recent
developments in this field are,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the argument that the models need
to be simple, which I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is no reason to try to
over explain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this from other phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can explain something using three
variables, then there is no need to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 variables into the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, principal component analysis is a
tool that we all often use to bring down
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's then easier to make sense of
what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my attempt to talk around your question
is now going on for one and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you get from this is I think
there is probably some slack in what on
[SPEAKER_00]: the computational side can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should not be afraid to add
parameters or add algorithms to our
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling attempts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to what extent that can be realized is
a little bit beyond my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have modeler friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have played with not just
decomposing organic matter, but breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter down into certain
functional categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seemed to be a useful approach
that has been published last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in Geoscientific Model
Developments, an obscure journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are interested in detail,
I'm happy to share the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus, again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
