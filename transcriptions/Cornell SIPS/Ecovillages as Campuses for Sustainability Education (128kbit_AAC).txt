[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, my name is Daniel Greenberg,
and I'm founder and director of this
[SPEAKER_02]: organization called Living Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to do is really briefly
talk about what are eco-villages,
[SPEAKER_02]: these sustainable communities that we work
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just show one slide of each of
the places we go, just to give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor of some of the communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I really want to talk about why
we believe eco-villages and sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: communities make ideal campuses to teach
about sustainable community development.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do a comparison between eco-villages
and academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually start off with some big
picture stuff, state of the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change, peak oil, carrying
capacity, footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do all that, because I'm
just guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that I'm preaching to the
converted here that you all understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're living in a unique time,
not just in human history, but in
[SPEAKER_02]: planetary history, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all on the same page there?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so let's move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to talk about the why so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple of ways into talking
about what eco-villages are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eco-villages, in its simplest form,
are just a group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've come together, and they're
trying to model sustainable lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically saying, look,
we can't wait any longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't wait for governments to legislate
solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't wait for businesses to bring
solutions to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are the best practices around the
world, from sustainable agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: renewable energy, appropriate technology,
local building materials, all of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we bring them together into
community scale solutions that work for us
[SPEAKER_02]: and for our environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not utopias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to say that clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not perfect places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went looking for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't found any.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, we feel like they make these
ideal campuses to learn about sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another way to think about
eco-villages, we're all aware of this
[SPEAKER_02]: growing gap between the resource rich and
the resource poor around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people, when you talk to them or
if you're reading about sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: development, we're talking about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we raise the quality of life among
the resource poor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not arguing with this at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is critical work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are billions of people living
without access to clean water,
[SPEAKER_02]: education, medical facilities,
shelter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, this needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I don't hear a lot of people
talking about is, what are the goals?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the models?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the limits to this kind of
development?
[SPEAKER_02]: And often, if you scratch a little bit
just below the surface, people will
[SPEAKER_02]: respond, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, give us a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to raise the quality of life
with people who really need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if we're lucky, we'll get to first
world standard lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of a delicate thing to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, as a privileged Westerner,
that this may not be possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the evidence is really clear that
our planet can't support our present
[SPEAKER_02]: population of around 7 billion with our
present lifestyles, much less the 9 or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: billion expected by 2040, all living first
world standard lifestyles, all with a car
[SPEAKER_02]: in the garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even up for us to decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Earth is already giving us
feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are already consequences around our
global actions through climate change and
[SPEAKER_02]: peak oil and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we absolutely need to figure out,
where are the goals for resource poor to
[SPEAKER_02]: raise their quality of life?
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, equally important,
if not more important, we need to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out how to reduce the ecological impact of
the resource rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Us, I'm talking by and large, westernized
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about hybrid cars and
composites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would suggest that if we're going to
get through this bottleneck that I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we're facing as a species, we need to
consider more radical alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really what eco-villages have done
is they've staked out this middle ground
[SPEAKER_02]: between this growing gap of the resource
rich and the resource poor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're saying, how do we raise the
resource poor above what some would call
[SPEAKER_02]: the dignity floor?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we allow everyone on the planet to
have a base access to adequate wealth and
[SPEAKER_02]: resources?
[SPEAKER_02]: A sense of agency in their lives?
[SPEAKER_02]: A sense of well-being?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get everyone above the dignity
floor?
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, how do we get
everyone below what some would call the
[SPEAKER_02]: profligacy ceiling, otherwise known as
carrying capacity?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our livable zone in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all have to get in there if we're
going to survive, if not thrive as a
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sad truth is very few of us are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the eco-villages we go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you a slide of Finnhorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone here at Finnhorn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Place in Northern Scotland?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to celebrate their 50th
anniversary next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably the grandmother,
the grandfather of the contemporary
[SPEAKER_02]: eco-village movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're really on the cutting edge of
what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a study done a couple years
ago looking at their ecological footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found was the average member
of Finnhorn had half the ecological
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were using half of ecologically
productive land and water area than an
[SPEAKER_02]: average UK citizen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made international press.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were lauded as the most sustainable
village in the Western Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if everyone lived the way they live at
Finnhorn, we'd still need more than one
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's Finnhorn on the cutting edge of
the eco-village movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're still not in this livable
zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sad truth is I really think we're
in kindergarten.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a species, we're in kindergarten in
terms of where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: In sustainable relationship to each other
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, eco-villages?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe third, fourth grade?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to get to middle school,
high school, college.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to graduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do think there are some exams
coming that we really want to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so eco-villages are just experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're beta test centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying how do we try to figure
this out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're going to have to figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little bit about eco-villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really quickly about living roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an educational nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We partner with the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we run these study abroad programs
based in sustainable communities and
[SPEAKER_02]: eco-villages around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some quick background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was an undergrad at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started in electrical engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I shifted to psychology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started teaching computers to kids at
GIAC downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized I liked kids more than
computers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started dreaming of creating a
school for children in a community
[SPEAKER_02]: setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to Minnesota to do
doctoral work at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota in Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up doing my doctoral thesis on
children and growing up in communes,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Intentional communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I studied the topic probably two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent out surveys everywhere I could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read everything I could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopped into a Westphalia camper
van with my then partner, now wife,
[SPEAKER_02]: Monique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we traveled to about 30 or 40
intentional communities, communes around
[SPEAKER_02]: North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I swear, I think I learned more the
first day I stepped foot in one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: communities than I did in those two years
I had spent studying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, now I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly I understood it viscerally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to do a school psychology
internship for my doctoral program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I rode around to communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Finnhorn, this community in Scotland,
rode back and said, yeah, we could use
[SPEAKER_02]: some help with our kids, which they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we moved there for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was an incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the middle of that year,
a friend brought over some college
[SPEAKER_02]: students from, I think it was Prescott
College.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were there for a week,
maybe two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that time frame, I saw each one of
them pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their lives were transformed in very much
the same way that I felt when I started
[SPEAKER_02]: traveling to communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember waking up with goosebumps
one night thinking, oh, this is why I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like on that level of purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I build this bridge between
academia and these communities to help
[SPEAKER_02]: more people have this experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: This experience of connection,
of interdependence, of community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was back in 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the last 20 years has really been
about doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started directing a program to South
India, to a community called Orville.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you a slide of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 98, I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 99, I started living rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been an amazing experience and
blessing and privilege to be able to do
[SPEAKER_02]: this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the programs that we run
currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do semester, January, and summer
programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Semester, we go to Finhorn in Scotland,
Israel, a kibbutz called Lothan,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Monteverde Institute in Costa Rica,
and Orville in South India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in January, we go to Waiwai
Kyoto, a community in Mexico, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: Orville in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the summer, we have programs
in Peru, high Amazon in Peru, called
[SPEAKER_02]: Satchamama, a couple programs near the
community I left, near called Sirius,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Brazil, EcoCentral EPEC, and
Australia, Crystal Waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's others that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are probably about 2,000
self-identified eco-villages on the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's many more that just don't
self-identify that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Sri Lanka, there's like 10,000
villages that are trying to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all depends on how you define them
and where you draw the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, this is some of the most
exciting news of the planet, that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are people just doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we figure this out in community
scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to show you one picture of each of
these places, this is the semester program
[SPEAKER_02]: at Finhorn in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finhorn's way up here on the north coast
of Scotland, right on the North Sea,
[SPEAKER_02]: about a half hour east of Inverness,
where the Loch Ness Monster is supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good 10 hours from London by bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, Finhorn's going to be
celebrating its 50th anniversary next
[SPEAKER_02]: November.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's about 450 people from maybe
30, 35 different nationalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what their motto is creating positive
visions for humanity and the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a saying, actually, at Finhorn
that goes, work is love and action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work is love and action.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea being, how do we raise our
consciousness to the highest level
[SPEAKER_02]: possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how do we manifest that in the
world?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we bring that into the world in
everything we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's harvesting beets,
whether it's building a building,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's cooking a meal or cleaning a
toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an attention to detail,
a sense of aesthetic at Finhorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know just being there, I feel
uplifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just really nice to be around
people that are really consciously trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their conference hall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was built mostly out of volunteer
labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't really see probably from
where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the workmanship was exquisite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really a lot of attention
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nature sanctuary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one person's inspiration,
built out of all found and recycled
[SPEAKER_02]: materials, turf roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a whole bunch of houses
in this neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all built out of old whiskey
barrels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is Scotland, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a company moving from
wood vats to metal vats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember if they were giving
them away for free or someone at Finhorn
[SPEAKER_02]: bought them cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just sort of piling up in a
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until this guy, Roger, a dude in there
looked at him and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could live in a flat house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he built this house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's a couple two-story barrel
houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like out of a hobbit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also own this big hotel about five
miles away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought in the mid-'80s for about
$150,000, if you can believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been renovating it ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have wonderful gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really large farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do provide and produce a lot of
their own food, about 80%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of work with the CSAs in the
region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Finhorn is actually quite known for
their gourmet meals.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Finhorn cookbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's how some people have heard
about Finhorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this program, a lot of our programs,
our courses are really looking at our
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk a lot about relational pedagogy,
relationships with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a community dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an economics course, communication
skills, all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have an ecology course.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is an ecovillage?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the successes, challenges of
Finhorn, state of the world stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also a world view course to
really deconstruct some of the stories and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultural values that got us to where we
are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that we've become this
juggernaut of destruction as a species?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are our options?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we even think about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really an opportunity for us as
students to step back and reflect on a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of deep, deep values.
[SPEAKER_02]: The programs we go to, the communities,
ecovillages we go to, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: religious communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say that they're spiritual in
the sense that they're really asking those
[SPEAKER_02]: big questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, purpose, why are we here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a service course to allow
students an opportunity to really get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved and do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Israel, there's actually a small
group of kibbutzim called the Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Kibbutz Movement, maybe a dozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of them are down in the Negev,
in the Arab, in the desert of Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably the most active of
them, called Kibbutz Lotan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a reform Jewish kibbutzim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been around for 20 or so
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to form a kibbutz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they went to the government of
Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, sure, we'll give you some
land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, wait a minute,
we don't want anything that's in dispute,
[SPEAKER_02]: any land in dispute.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, fine, we'll put you in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were there for like 10 years,
and kind of just doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they slowly started waking up to
the fact that they were in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, why are we here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do we have cows?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they really took it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done a lot of work with
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a familiar concept to most people?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, I can explain a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: The students have actually helped build
their own dormitories.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of work with natural
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government of Israel will build these
cement block houses, which in the desert
[SPEAKER_02]: just are awful buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of work with solar and
natural building.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a wonderful bird sanctuary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a really amazing place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get up into these hills and you
look down, it's just this oasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this little dot in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're really trying to figure out
how they can bring back life there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on this course, there's a Peace and
Social Justice course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The students really have an opportunity to
get involved with Palestinians,
[SPEAKER_02]: Arab Israelis, Bedouins, and really try to
see the situation through multiple lenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what we feel how peace is going to
come to the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about who's right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about how many stories can we hold at
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a permaculture course,
appropriate technologies, and there's also
[SPEAKER_02]: a communications course here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're trying to turn that into a
community economics course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Costa Rica, we have a program at the
Monteverde Institute in the cloud forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tropical ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Spanish course.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a service learning course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did I say Peace and Social Justice?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are the four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a semester program that we've
been running in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: India, this is another one of my favorite
places in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a community called Oroville.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's down in the south, three hours south
of Chennai, very close to Panache,
[SPEAKER_02]: right on the Bay of Bengal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a large community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 2,200 people, about 45
different nationalities, incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: international.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're building, as they call it,
a city the earth needs, a sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their dream is to become a city for 50,000
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a large area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 14 square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about a little less than half of that
membership are from India, and the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: are from around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Oroville is essentially this big
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two founders, Sri Aurobindo and
a woman, Meera Alfalsa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sri Aurobindo died in 1950.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that he talked about a lot
was how he believed humanity is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: brink of an evolutionary leap in
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wasn't talking about the 16th
century.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's talking about this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to really think about how do we
change how we think about things if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to survive as a species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Oroville is basically made up of
people who say, yeah, and I believe that,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I want to believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we create a city, a vessel,
a container for this new consciousness to
[SPEAKER_02]: emerge?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really this radical, sometimes
chaotic experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do reinvent the wheel a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're trying to do different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 13 different organic farms
using all different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's French intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one farm based on Fukuoka's one
straw revolution from Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Permaculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This building down here looks like the
Epcot Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a meditation hall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a place for people to go and just
be silent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a place for religion or dogma or
even groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a place to be silent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big solar dish, probably twice
the size of this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it collects the sun's rays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it superheats water, the steam of
which is used to cook 1,200 meals a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like community scale
appropriate technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not technology for an individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not technology for a metropolitan
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we create technology that we can
live with in groups?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an area that needs a
lot of development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the places that
ecovillages are really pushing the edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing I've ever found in an
ecovillage in terms of technology that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't find being done better elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are better windmills
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are better organic farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are better LEEDS buildings and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecovillages aren't pushing the edge of
individual technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: What ecovillages are doing is they're
saying, how do we put the pieces together
[SPEAKER_02]: into cultures, into stories, into real
life communities where we can live these
[SPEAKER_02]: lives?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's where we need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, they're looking at
how do we do this economically and ways
[SPEAKER_02]: that fit for us in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then we have a couple short
programs, a lot of them around
[SPEAKER_02]: permaculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not familiar with permaculture,
it's a system of ecological design.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically asking, how does nature design?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the principles of design that we
can discern from nature?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how do we apply those principles
to the human built environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: It started in Australia, gosh what,
maybe 40 years ago I think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started as a concatenation of permanent
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we create agricultural systems that
don't need constant human input,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that are just naturally sustainable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's evolved into now, today,
it's more often thought of as permanent
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gone beyond agriculture and it's
looking at the built environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: social systems and economics even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's become quite popular around the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost track, but I would guess
probably 40 or 50,000 people around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world have gone through a permaculture
design course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is a fairly structured
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We expand on that because we base these in
communities and we want to really include
[SPEAKER_02]: that aspect as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're really happy to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the places we go to is a
community called EcoCentra EPEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in the Cerrado of Brazil,
southwest of Brasilia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a community that was designed
using these permaculture principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a six week program in
Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that slide I showed you
before with sort of resource rich and
[SPEAKER_02]: resource poor?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it that way,
there's really two directions toward
[SPEAKER_02]: ecovillages.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the resource rich areas, like here,
people are developing ecovillages saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we maintain a high quality
lifestyle, but reduce our footprint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecovillagedifica is an excellent example
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's ecovillages from resource
poor worlds where they're saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we increase our quality of life,
but maintain a light footprint?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an example in Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: India is really interesting because in
Oregon, they're kind of doing both because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so international.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is sort of that Western mentality,
but there's also a very strong indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here there's a six week program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a course in Spanish and Quechua,
which is the non-colonial language.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also looking at biocultural
regeneration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shamanism and fair trade coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they work with what are called
mountain microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know a whole lot about them,
but I think they cultivate them for
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms in the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's used as a way to fertilize
the fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they see it as a potential alternative
to slash and burn agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do a lot of work around that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really amazing opportunity in
the high Amazon of Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is where I live in Western
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a community called Sirius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And notice how it's spelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the dog staring up, Sirius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a spinoff of Finnhorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Sirius has been around 78,
so what does that make it, about 34,
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a smaller community.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's maybe 20 members.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a larger, wider community
around it of maybe 150.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the community center, the
backside, with a wonderful greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the upstairs here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the classroom that the
students take over for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And students go in to design teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they learn these permaculture
principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they work with clients,
either at Sirius or in the surrounding
[SPEAKER_02]: area, of applying these principles to the
needs that are expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a January program in
Mexico at a community called Hue Hue
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyoto.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a fun story.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were basically a traveling group.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing troubadours.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing performance art and
theater throughout Central and South
[SPEAKER_02]: America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were called the illuminated
elephant or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were going around on buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they got tired of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they settled here in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got really good at decision
making and facilitating group process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we do our course on
there, looking at conflict and
[SPEAKER_02]: communication styles and decision making,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's still a strong art and theater
focus there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we can, we get to Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: The birthplace of permaculture to this
community called Crystal Waters,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is another community designed using
these principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's various reasons why we haven't
been there for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Max Lindegard is one of the best
permaculture teachers I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been teaching it for like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that gives you a little kind of visual
sense of some of the ecovillages that are
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to shift now and talk a little bit
about why ecovillages make really good
[SPEAKER_02]: campuses for sustainability education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any thoughts, questions up until
now?
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed in the upcoming ecovillages that
you were going to work with, there was one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the ones that was Twin Oaks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the one in Virginia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little lower on our radar right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally I was thinking it would be
great to do a program based at Earth Haven
[SPEAKER_02]: in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe do trips to Twin Oaks and
the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a possible thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is it's pretty expensive to
run a program in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it would actually cost about the
same as a program in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you talk to a student, like,
well, you could go to Virginia or India.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to attract people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_04]: To bounce off that, are you finding that
students internationally are interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: coming to the US?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other world that we haven't
looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do want to develop a semester program
actually locally at Sirius and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pioneer Valley, the Happy Valley,
the Tofu Curtain of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we were to do that, we were
thinking both to connect more deeply with
[SPEAKER_02]: the five colleges, UMass Amherst and the
four colleges around it, Smith,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mount Holyoke, Amherst, and Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought maybe that would be a
really interesting opportunity to attract
[SPEAKER_02]: international students to come to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk just for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can just open up for some
discussion around what I want to do is
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of dissect the hidden curriculum
between academia and eco villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do I mean by this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's talked about in a number of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, Chet Bauer, talked about the
meta narratives of the systems that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to Cornell, you're learning a
lot, hopefully, in the classes you take.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would suggest you're also learning a
lot from just participating in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a hidden curriculum that we learn
just by being a part of groups and
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, simple things, you know,
sit up straight, pencil down, eyes ahead,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't cheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all these things are rules that
we learn by being part of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I want to do is sort of make a
comparison between what I see as some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those, the hidden agenda, hidden
curriculum of academia versus eco
[SPEAKER_02]: villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I do that, I just want to say
I'm really painting the ends of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be a little provocative,
I hope it is, you know, and I hope you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't agree with everything I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to put it out there and
maybe some of it will resonate and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: it won't and we can talk about it,
okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to get into it, for example,
academia is conventional, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the basic structure of academia
has not changed since the Middle Ages,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you just walk around and a lot
of the structures of how things are here,
[SPEAKER_02]: things are slow to move, they're very
bureaucratic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I felt that when I was at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas eco villages are experimental,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something doesn't work, you just can
shift on a dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they tend to be a little bit more
nimble about how to think about things and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to look at things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, academia is hierarchical,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, power emanates from the president
and provost down to deans and faculty and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, students are at the low run
here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really is telling a story of power
over, submission to authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not such a big leap to be in
an institution like this and then go out
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, well, we have to subjugate
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to apply that story that I learned
viscerally through participating in this
[SPEAKER_02]: institution to what I'm doing in the
natural world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas eco villages tend to be more
heterarchical.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a word, I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people in eco villages tend to
interact more on a peer level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's not so much a power
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academia is competitive through and
through, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt there's a lot at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a great place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I felt it intensely competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students for grades, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Faculty for tenure, grants, recognition,
schools for endowments, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, it infiltrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's throughout the whole system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that competition is
completely foreign in eco villages,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they tend to be more cooperative.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to say, how is the success of
the individual tied to the success of the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we really support each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the idea of cheating doesn't
make sense in the real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called collaboration, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we come out of schools thinking,
you can't trade information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what really happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academia is fragmented, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about this silo mentality in eco
village, in academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about rigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I think of that, I think of sort
of two dimensions of rigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: In traditional academia, there's very much
a vertical rigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, how much can you dive
into one topic and really dig down as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as you can go into one particular sub,
sub, sub topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not denying that's interesting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the interesting stuff that I know
about happening in academia is almost all
[SPEAKER_02]: science disciplinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all happening across the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so eco villages are inherently looking
at a more lateral rigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not to say that there's any less
quality of engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's any less critical reflection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's looking at how do we bridge these
disciplines?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we think across ideas?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you put up a windmill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about regional planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about social systems and
decision making.
[SPEAKER_02]: And governance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all these disciplines come to bear
in the real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's just use those as real life
experiments and opportunities to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academia is proximal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, in schools, from the
beginning up through mostly, it changes a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, but through college and grad
school, we tend to be age segregated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to have very mediated
relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are all in a class together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a relationship with your faculty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a faculty advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all through certain ways of
being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of know the rules,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in eco villages, they tend to be
more intimate relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people interact with each other in a
lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might be farming with someone one
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be cooking with them another
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in a meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a decision making process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to know people in the fullness
of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember when I said when I started
traveling to communities, I had this sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of epiphany when I started going to these
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what was happening was it was
almost like there was this need in me that
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started getting filled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a very confusing experience for
a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I now label that need as is
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's belonging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think that we have lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: A sense of community.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in the western world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've lost a sense of community so
profoundly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That most of us don't even think of it as
something to strive for.
[SPEAKER_02]: To look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was at Cornell, a lot of late night
discussions around how we want to live our
[SPEAKER_02]: lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of parents we want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of work we want to do in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we might even be making lists.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to get out of life?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about that, what shows up
on those lists?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a loving partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living in a nice house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to earn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea of belonging to a community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, doesn't it sound a little old
fashioned?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost vaguely religious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, eh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds a little scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people, when I talk about
ecovillages, they're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're really kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they are a little weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll grant them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're marginal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really don't have anything to say to
our society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I hear that, I reflect back and
say, you know, I encourage you to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: step back and take a more evolutionary
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember that for 99.9% of our
evolutionary history, we lived in
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lived in tribes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is in our bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in our genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are viscerally wired to be social
animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really only been since the
industrial revolution that we've gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: How?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because we've accessed the cheap
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can live in the suburbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can drive to the mall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go get my food at the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to interact with anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we've lost something profound
in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I started traveling to
communities, it was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sense of belonging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I see sort of wake up in
the students that go on these programs,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, or spend time in eco villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's not just about a sense
of well-being and happiness around
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about community and belonging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think it's fundamental to the
sustainability of our planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we could do what we do to
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we could do what we do to
the planet if we fundamentally felt,
[SPEAKER_02]: I belong here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You belong here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That desert belongs here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to figure this out together.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to boil this all down to one
word, it would be interdependence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, how many of you ever heard of
Thich Nhat Hanh, the Buddhist monk?
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything he's written is worth reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, let me get back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll mention it in a minute down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting back to, well, let me just say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it's foundational.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does exist in academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people come to college to have
that sense of the academic community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not dissing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's something valuable
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think there's so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage each of you, wherever you
are in your lives, to be thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: who's your tribe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you belong to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who belongs to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really think we're moving toward
a place when that's essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to be thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very theoretical, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very armchair theoretician.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to train people in their heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote a blog entry a while ago that if I
had to choose blindly between two
[SPEAKER_02]: candidates to teach on one of our
programs, and one was a master's level and
[SPEAKER_02]: one was a PhD, I'd probably choose the
masters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't make me many friends in
academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason is that master's level
folks tend to get the degree because they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get out there and do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People who go on to PhDs tend to be a
little more in their heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm making grand generalizations here,
OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: So forgive me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've got a PhD myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And PhD programs even tend to train
armchair theoreticians, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my graduate program in Minnesota,
I was astonished.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a program in child development and
school psychology.
[SPEAKER_02]: How little of it had to do with being with
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was all laboring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best thing I did in my graduate
program besides my dissertation was I got
[SPEAKER_02]: an early ed teaching certificate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually went into the preschool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I worked with the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all my colleagues were like,
why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of messy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there is this weird kind of
separation between what we think of in
[SPEAKER_02]: academia and what is actually in the real
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does this say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the meaning of life true, false,
multiple choice, essay, or what,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecovillages are applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't work, you try something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really about how do we bring this
knowledge into real life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academia is secular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get back to this concept in a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this idea, this myth of
objectivity, that we can somehow study the
[SPEAKER_02]: world but not influence or be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in ecovillages, I use the word
spiritual, but I know it's a loaded term.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think of it in terms of the big
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, why are we here, purpose,
meaning?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, again, the word that I would
use is interdependence, or better yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: the word that ticked on Han coin,
which is interbeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hear that word, interbeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a wonderful word.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the idea is like, how do we see
the clouds in our textbooks?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do we see it all connected
together?
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anything that science has shown
in the last 150 years, it's that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's funny, I was at a
conference a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Association for the Advancement
of Sustainability in Higher Education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was at a workshop that was sort of
an advanced level workshop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was called competencies,
core competencies in sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was people who had been involved
in the field for a long time getting
[SPEAKER_02]: together saying, okay, let's teach about
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the core things we want students
to come away with?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we want them to know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got into tables and we started
talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was the first one to say something
at my table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, look, this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we do it, I just want us to
recognize that we're jumping into the
[SPEAKER_02]: what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we should take a step back and
reflect on the why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we talk just about competencies
and what we want students to know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: do, we're missing a huge thing,
which is really about the why.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a woman, Joanna Macy, anyone hear
of her?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a nuclear activist, systems
thinker, Buddhist scholar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, anything she's written is worth
reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: She talks about this great turning toward
an ecological age that we're in,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully, now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she says there's three things driving
this turning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is what she calls holding
actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is slowing the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: This juggernaut of destruction that we've
become as a species.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we stop all that stuff from
rainforest destruction and the Keystone
[SPEAKER_02]: XL, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we slow and stop the stuff that's
really hurting the planet?
[SPEAKER_02]: But something she said that was really
powerful to me, she says it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, I think I was reading
her when I was a student.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was part of some of the activism
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was arrested in Day Hall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing shanty towns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to get Cornell to divest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very much that kind of burnout,
we're just going to make the change happen
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've got to stop all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I read that, it was like,
wow, yeah, we need to do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two other things, she says,
we need to create new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to create new institutions across
the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to create new economic
institutions, new educational
[SPEAKER_02]: institutions, new forms of community,
new ways of learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this we need to recreate for a
post-oil, post-carrying capacity world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we don't create the new,
we're just going to go back to the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the really powerful thing,
she says, is even that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said there's one more thing that
really drives it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really world views,
stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we think about who we are?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, it really comes down to
this idea of interbeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually think it's something we can
all get behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I was astonished at is getting
back to that table, that round table where
[SPEAKER_02]: we were talking about core competencies,
is I shared this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, really, for me, the why is we're
all interconnected.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to come from that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy across the table for me looked
at me and said, yeah, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, that's your value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we should be teaching
our personal values in education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were the elite of people working in
sustainability in higher education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he thought interdependence was just a
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, whoa, we really are in
kindergarten.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get flack for talking about
spirituality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really think it's core, because I
think this is how we need to reorient what
[SPEAKER_02]: we teach and really look at how are we
connected to everything around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academia, large footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I barely need to say this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you just walk around Cornell and
it's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And elite colleges, universities,
they've got to have their expansive lawns
[SPEAKER_02]: and their cutting edge science facilities
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also need to recognize what it
actually does to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cornell is doing some great stuff
around sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had dinner with my friend Dan Roth
the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing great work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, ecovillages start from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, how can we live a light
footprint from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you the Nature Sanctuary at
Finhorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last but far from least, academia I tend
to find is fairly problem-oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that even just maybe 10 years
ago, there were lots of environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: studies and science courses that were
basically litanies of the problems in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't tell you how many students
have come to us kind of overwhelmed in
[SPEAKER_02]: grief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're almost numb,
because they're like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read the books.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one's talking about what we're
going to do about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for many students, the only way they
can deal with that is to shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to be able to see communities that are
actually working toward solutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: working toward a place that we can
actually live well and happy together is
[SPEAKER_02]: just such a breath of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it is for students as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly don't think the world is
going to shift towards sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we all know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of scary stuff in the world
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly think we're sort of
approaching a fork as a species.
[SPEAKER_02]: On one path, there's the bunker mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the predominant story of our
culture, of certainly nations,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're going to protect our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get our bomb shelter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put food there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get my guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to have my boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come and you try to get what's
mine, I'm going to get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that if we go down that
path, we will go extinct as a species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's another path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the path of community,
the path of compassion, of generosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if we go down that path,
that's where I think this could be the
[SPEAKER_02]: most exciting time for humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that these aren't perfect
solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that ecovillages and
sustainable communities are just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: push that envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, being a part of that has been
incredibly fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that for students as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some time, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can take this information
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if you want to be on our mailing
list, I can put this around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of anticlimactic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we send out newsletters and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, let me actually go back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me actually also get some.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can ask some specific questions if you
guys have questions about the talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'd like to do a sort of a
group-oriented discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're shy, raise your hand and we can
get you in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're shy, speak out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess, are there any questions now,
first of all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anna.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very good at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was living in a potential
community in West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely can feel you on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a dessert place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a claymore society.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in Charleston, not Charlestown.
[SPEAKER_05]: But something that I think they were
struggling with, and I definitely felt a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of there, was maintaining a population
through generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had started in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really strong for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people are 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they go to college.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not a lot of people came back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems like for the past,
I guess it's 40 or 50 years now,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's been going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past 20, it's a lot of adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just doesn't seem like you can
have a sustainable community without all
[SPEAKER_05]: generations to meet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious if you've seen any villages
that have found a solution to that,
[SPEAKER_05]: or are also struggling with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least they're having babies,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the shakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is an issue in a lot of
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's natural, in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you think these communities are
really radical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes a lot of ideological fervor
among the founders to do something that
[SPEAKER_02]: radical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can't expect our kids to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it's often the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because kids often want to do the opposite
of what their parents are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often think, oh, living roots,
my dream is to have this be sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: communiversity by the time my kids are in
college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they're going to want to be
stockbrokers or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a couple ways that I found
that communities that have been successful
[SPEAKER_02]: that have dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is they've created layers of the
onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So example, Sirius, where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I were members for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started living roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be a member, at Sirius,
you have to give eight hours a week of
[SPEAKER_02]: community service and go to the Thursday
night meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got to be a point where my wife,
Monique, was saying, you're ain't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: those meetings anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here at home with the kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just didn't have the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a challenge in a lot of
communities, that it's difficult for
[SPEAKER_02]: families and professionals to really be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did was we moved across the
street.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of other people did the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we live in this incredibly
community-minded neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I created these little timeshare for
child care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just share a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one way that it happens,
is that people just move one step outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of the community, but they still stay
engaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another way is that they get big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Finhorn and Oroville are big enough
where the youth feel like they can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: rebel but still stay part of the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oroville, there's still enough growing
edges that young people can say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make my mark over here,
and I'm not going to have to feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just carrying on what my parents did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finhorn, what's happening is a lot of the
youth go away, and then they come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been happening a lot,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of communities just exist on
people coming and going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they recognize that there's going to
be a core group of people that are there
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are people who kind of come
and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can read my thesis on children and
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other thoughts, and I'm happy to carry on
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say something more about kids and
communities, since you kind of brought it
[SPEAKER_02]: up, and that's a passion of mine?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could go back, and if I could do my
thesis again, I mean, it was a wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really bit off way more than I could
chew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was basically looking at
children and education and community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was nothing that escaped my
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I found fascinating,
that I think deserves a lot more research,
[SPEAKER_02]: are the relationships that children are
able to form in community with adults that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't their parents, that aren't their
teachers, aren't their friends' parents,
[SPEAKER_02]: or their friends' parents, but are just
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how many of you had that
growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no adult in my life that was
just a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: In community, it's the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's such a powerful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's something so sad that
we've gotten away from that in our
[SPEAKER_02]: society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so grateful that my kids have been
able to grow up in a place where they can
[SPEAKER_02]: walk to their friends' houses,
and they just know that their friends'
[SPEAKER_02]: houses are their houses, and they just
know the area, and they feel like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: part of this tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's our goal, which I hope it is,
to help develop global citizens,
[SPEAKER_02]: people with a sense of belonging to the
whole planet, I can't think of a better
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation for that than to grow up in a
community where you have strong
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships with people beyond your own
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, I was in child care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was, again, the 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working in preschools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a man, I would get one of two types
of feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was, aw.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my kids get to hang out with a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one was like, why are you
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And neither of those were seeing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be a good child care provider or a
bad child care provider, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of that is just because
we don't live in a culture where this is
[SPEAKER_02]: normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think kids in communities is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there weren't that many kids in the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was the youngest person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think mostly kids have left about five
years before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One last thing on that is that it was
interesting that when we started running
[SPEAKER_02]: programs at Findhorn, they were nervous at
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at Findhorn, if you look at the
demographics, there was this dip from 18
[SPEAKER_02]: to 25, because they're all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all go to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, we're going to bring some
college students.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, ah, they're going to make
a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also found there was this filling
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, this feels good,
because it actually, we need that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: energy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that population density has
an impact on the community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of did grow up in a rural
farming community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the 4-H program.
[SPEAKER_00]: New neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you could kind of compare it,
I grew up almost in the 60s without the
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just wondering if you felt that
that could be a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is population density, like a town becomes
a city, does it become less of a
[SPEAKER_00]: community?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I look for in
the communities we take students to is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it has to be grockable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be of a size where you feel like
you can get to know most people in that
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe more importantly, you can become
known in that community.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no set number on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some say it's 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some say it can go up to 1,000,
maybe over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that there is a natural
resonance that we have in groups that are
[SPEAKER_02]: knowable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've often thought, oh,
it would be great to do a semester program
[SPEAKER_02]: in an urban area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of great things
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't found the way to do it that
has that magic component of waking
[SPEAKER_02]: students up to that sense of community.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying is a magic number
hasn't really, or a magic stock in
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work at cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic population isn't really known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a quality of community rather
than of density.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what happens often, like Orville,
which I said is this large community of
[SPEAKER_02]: about 2,200 people, they have naturally
just broken into smaller communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some ways, they're best thought of
as like a township.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's maybe 100 communities that
range from five people to 100 people or
[SPEAKER_02]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all part of this other
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's where we need to go,
is thinking about those layers of the
[SPEAKER_02]: onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is my intimate group that I'm really
working with and living with day to day?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then who's that other group that I'm
making decisions with that maybe I'm part
[SPEAKER_02]: of some collectives with, conscious
collaborative consumption, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: CSAs, trading, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how are we part of something
larger, but that we actually feel a sense
[SPEAKER_02]: of agency in that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that could go up even into cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a very unrelated sort of logistical
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do people in eco villages handle
getting medical care or health care?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wear glasses, and I like to go
to the dentist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people that would have disabilities or
diseases and ailments and such,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do they get access to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are rational people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, we're not expecting every eco
village to have a hospital, an airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are often health facilities
in at least the larger communities,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even the smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of know who to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my wife is a midwife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people know things around that,
or homeopathic and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of just local wisdom and
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But things like that, yeah, they go to the
doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to wherever they need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the world we live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, remember I said that study
that was done at Finnhorn that showed that
[SPEAKER_02]: it had half the ecological footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only that high because of their
travel, because there's a lot of people at
[SPEAKER_02]: Finnhorn who are fairly known in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go out and do workshops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're flying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're driving and taking buses and
trains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what upped their footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because we just live in a world
that there's a fossil fuel economy that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't really get away from at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you do what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also unrelated, I really liked your
comment about recognizing that you enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: kids more than computers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized quite a while ago that I prefer
trees over people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also realized that you can't get rid
of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm balancing my own perspective on
life and what's right for me as a person
[SPEAKER_03]: and my ideologies and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realizing that what I would like to
start focusing on is the short list of
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I don't agree with and
learning how to somewhat capitalize off of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I take that negative energy of,
hey, I don't really like people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why not teach young people about
trees?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sort of taking a different
stance on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of where I really liked the
comment that you made, because sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just recognizing the simplicities of
putting things in a category.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this alone, everything on
the right side speaks to me and always
[SPEAKER_03]: has.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think also you said something about
filling that void that you feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: you've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at the point that I came to
Cornell, I started to recognize that much
[SPEAKER_03]: more, how I would be an advocate of
academia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, since I'm so unconventional,
I feel uncomfortable in that type of
[SPEAKER_03]: setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, that the correlation of different
disciplinaries and collaborative work,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where the rubber meets the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right that in the real world,
that's what it takes to make things
[SPEAKER_03]: happen, is multiple people around a large
table, all coming from a different
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, and then being able to come
together and devise those solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, in short, what academia taught
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I learned that long before I
came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took coming here for me to
recognize that I knew that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to do all that in trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it was the recognition of where my
love of the environment and my love of art
[SPEAKER_03]: met together at a specific point in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was before I came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm building off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's putting things together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being creative and spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes compromises, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What struck in me was that you can imagine
a core dilemma of this business,
[SPEAKER_02]: this organization on the roots,
is that here we are, an organization all
[SPEAKER_02]: about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're flying people all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something really weird about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I strongly believe that the impact
that we make on students is lifelong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It far exceeds the impact of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, a friend actually did a study.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a semester program in an
ecological semester in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he found that students' ecological
footprint for that semester was lower in
[SPEAKER_02]: Costa Rica, including the impact from
their flights than what it would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: if they just stayed on campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not true of all our places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big way to go to India.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once they're there, they're living
their lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that we've done is
we have always been committed to measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: and reducing and somehow mitigating our
carbon impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And planting trees is a big place that we
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tree planting is a strong component.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of our programs are really
connecting the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cyclone, did I mention this,
that went through India recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did any of you see this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just before the new year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went right through Oroville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a cyclone thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a 100-year event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just ripped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some areas, 40 years of reforestation
were just gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're a resilient community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the silver lining, actually,
is that in the early days, folks in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oroville showed up and there was this
desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just started planting trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did they plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tree called the acacia auricular
forma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kind of eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really good at digging into
this really hard-baked soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like terracotta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this tree was really good at breaking
that up and making it available for other
[SPEAKER_02]: trees to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other trees showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, in this cyclone,
most of the trees that came down were what
[SPEAKER_02]: they called the work trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now the tropical dry of a green
forest is really there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, it was devastated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's left is what should be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other thoughts, questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to 420?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or less?
[SPEAKER_02]: 415, maybe?
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you don't see much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this also came out of that ideological
fervor of the founders.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had these big dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also true of Twin Oaks,
which you were mentioning, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were modeling themselves after the
kibbutzini.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, just because you have a kid
doesn't mean you're going to be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we find the people who are
really good with kids and have them raise
[SPEAKER_02]: the kids?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's something theoretical that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But practically, it didn't work to
separate that bond between children and
[SPEAKER_02]: parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it maybe lasted a generation or
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't find that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of that question of too much
community, communities are made up of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all different types of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find there's often continuums in any
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those continuums, I find,
is that on one end, there's the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are saying, look, I don't care how long it
takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care how long we sit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to work this through.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be up all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to come out with a
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as long as we all feel good about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's people on the other end
of the spectrum that say, I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: another damn meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to go build something,
all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people exist on those ends of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they often butt heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another spectrum I find is that there are
people who come to a community because
[SPEAKER_02]: they like it just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to cut another tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want another member.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are people, and I probably
am one of them, who come to a community
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of see it for what it can become.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, we can kind of clear this
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can create a whole new nucleus over
here or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we butt heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Japanese saying that if you want
to clean potatoes, one of the ways you do
[SPEAKER_02]: it is you put them all in a pot of water
and you shake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just by rubbing each other,
they clean each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been very grateful to see when
sometimes someone comes into a community
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have some sharp edges.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very strong opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be this way or the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, it's wonderful to see them
kind of soften a little bit and round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their communication skills improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's a real fundamental value
of living in communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that rubbing and kind of pissing each
other off, too, is really helping us
[SPEAKER_02]: become more resilient and understand how
we can communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take others' needs and values into
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think there probably is a place
of too much community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't even talked about,
I mean, you could go to the spectrum of
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about cults or what does that
mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, when the students come on our
program, I often ask them, how many of you
[SPEAKER_02]: in just the whole application set up to
this process, someone said to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you're joining a cult?
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost all of them raised their hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's an important question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, a cult is really about a
mindset of restricting individual growth
[SPEAKER_02]: and freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to think this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's taking away freedoms and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the programs, the communities we go
to, it's all about nourishing growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: freedom and saying, how do we support you
become who you want to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, cults are very unfortunate when
they show up in the form of community.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they can also just as easily show up
in a boardroom, Microsoft, or military.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schools, I mean, the cult, we should be
looking, we should always be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: lookout for the cult mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can exist in many areas in our
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to end on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experience with any
communities that have a specific strong
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm thinking, like, was it Camp
Hill Village, Steiner, BioDynamic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Camp Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, where I used to live in southern
New Hampshire, high mowing, and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole Camp Hill type place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it associated with high mowing seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's actually a boarding high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also, I can't remember the
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it just went through my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has an L in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But any eco-village or sustainable
community that's worth its salt or that is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to continue has to work with food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious, we are challenged because we're
on a hilltop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so very often, you dig down a foot and
you hit bedrock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been building up the soil
using permaculture methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still produce maybe 30% or 40% of
our own food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finhorn, again, does a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not just its own gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work a lot with surrounding regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oroville is probably much better at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're probably in the 80 to 90
of producing their own food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another important point to make is
that a lot of people think, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a goal of all eco-villages to be
self-sufficient, to be able to kind of do
[SPEAKER_02]: their own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not been my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's really the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eco-villages that we bring students to are
very porous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're often, they see themselves as
catalysts in the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we help farmers in our area become
more organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we create local networks and
distribution networks so that we can ship
[SPEAKER_02]: goods locally and not have to ship them
from north of India or overseas or things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just about, hey, how do we
grow more of our own food?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how do we create more of a
sustainable bio region?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's the unit that we should
be thinking of becoming more
[SPEAKER_02]: self-dependent or self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, I'm thinking of other
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think off the top of my head of
communities that that's their central
[SPEAKER_02]: focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There probably are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's certainly a focus of everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be talking at Alice Cook at 7
o'clock, if you know anyone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever get ahold of an eco house?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even remember them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I actually stayed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just spoke at the eco house at SUNY
Geneseo yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
