[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Liz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apparently have a lot of slides,
so I'm going to try to go quickly through
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might gloss over a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the objectives for the talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to look at some basically
examples that I think illustrate why
[SPEAKER_03]: polyploids are challenging to work with
from an informatics perspective and a
[SPEAKER_03]: biological perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take the time to use those
examples to just look at some of the tools
[SPEAKER_03]: and resources that we've developed or
adopted from other groups and adapted to
[SPEAKER_03]: our needs, using them for our particular
research community, but hoping that
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll find more broad adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last is probably the most
audacious of the three bullet points.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been working on abstract algebra
as kind of a side hobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to try to make a case that it's
actually of relevance to understanding how
[SPEAKER_03]: complexity develops out of sort of
nonlinear multiplicative relationships
[SPEAKER_03]: like those that come out of putting two
genomes together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a quick kind of overview of
polyploidy in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens all the time, seemingly,
in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's known to happen in some other
systems, but way in the evolutionary past.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you work in plants, you know all
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't work in plants, it's kind of
a weird little niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are a lot of distinctions to be
made about types of polyploidy and how
[SPEAKER_03]: many genomes come together at once and how
recently it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are all important for thinking
about the actual approach you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: take with particular analytic solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've heard that the thinking is that
one of the reasons why plants are so
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerant of polyploidy is that most of
them don't actually have sex chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that facilitates the combination of
genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are challenges to the plant
associated with actually working out what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with having multiple genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after they've done that, they tend to
be a little bit more resilient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of crops that we work with
certainly have come from polyploid events,
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly because the gene redundancy kind
of gives you new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look at some of those questions a
little bit further on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they tend to occur in extreme
environments, partially because those
[SPEAKER_03]: environments tend to induce polyploid
formation, but also the thinking is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they are, because of the built-in
redundancy, they're better able to adapt
[SPEAKER_03]: to such conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, there are a lot of different
types of polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one distinguishes between allo and
auto, depending on whether or not the two
[SPEAKER_03]: genomes that are being duplicated are the
same or different.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a type of polyploidy that has to
do with somatic cells, doesn't actually
[SPEAKER_03]: lead to new species.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, mitotic events not actually
separating the results of genome doubling
[SPEAKER_03]: into separate cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's endopolyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then distinctions are made in terms of
how recent the polyploidy event is and how
[SPEAKER_03]: far along the evolutionary trajectory it's
gotten so that it's effectively become a
[SPEAKER_03]: diploid genetically again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on whether you're an
auto-polyploid or an allopolyploid,
[SPEAKER_03]: that introduces auto-polyploids basically
all of their chromosomes, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: the homeologous chromosomes, as we call
them, can potentially recombine with one
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that introduces new possibilities
in terms of the genetics that need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: thought about carefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Liz mentioned, we're interested in
comparative genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've developed a tool for basically
looking at gene content across species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of these glyphs represents a gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's colored in terms of gene families
they've been associated with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're dealing with, say,
simple species like primates and mice,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have nice, fairly simple relationships
between the gene content in the various
[SPEAKER_03]: genomes, one-to-one relationships in
general with occasional presence,
[SPEAKER_03]: absence, or copy number variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty easy to just pick out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're thinking about comparisons
between genomes, each of which has a kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of separate duplication history,
things become a lot more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here we have a few different
species that have different polyploidy
[SPEAKER_03]: histories, some ancient duplications that
they share, and then more recent
[SPEAKER_03]: duplications that have been separate in
the different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've got a little track of a
soybean chromosome at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see that it's been through two
whole genome doublings.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the tracks is much more similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the more recent duplication event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got some more ancient
events that are closer to one another
[SPEAKER_03]: because their doubling resulted from that
more recent event but further away from
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even something that you tend to think of
as a small genome like Arabidopsis has,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, chromosome doublings or whole
genome doublings involved with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: gene loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afterwards, you can easily see here
patterns of fractionation of the
[SPEAKER_03]: subgenomes that resulted from these whole
genome duplication events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomato actually went through a Hexploidy
event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this tool basically allows you to
dynamically query databases for tracks
[SPEAKER_03]: that have a certain gene content
associated with them and then pull in from
[SPEAKER_03]: disparate databases tracks that seem to
have similar gene content in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: gene family assignments and then
ultimately ask questions about the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolutionary history behind genes that
have been aligned through sentinel
[SPEAKER_03]: together and their phylogenetic
relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see that out of those four,
for that particular gene, which was from a
[SPEAKER_03]: antipsychic acid-responsive transcription
factor family, out of the soybean
[SPEAKER_03]: homeologues, three of them retained that
gene and it was lost in one, similarly
[SPEAKER_03]: with tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two were retained, one was lost,
and Arabidopsis also retained two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gives us a nice way of exploring
relationships among the genes but the
[SPEAKER_03]: question that still is difficult is,
well, what happens to function as these
[SPEAKER_03]: things have duplicated and then gone their
separate ways?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not so easy to resolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're also interested in, well,
some polyploid species like soybean are
[SPEAKER_03]: economically valuable and have a lot of
research that goes into them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their own database resources
with curators pulling in information from
[SPEAKER_03]: the literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we make use of comparative genomic
techniques to essentially take something
[SPEAKER_03]: like CalP, which does not have that more
recent whole genome duplication event,
[SPEAKER_03]: and figure out, okay, do I have any,
say, SNPs associated with seed weight in
[SPEAKER_03]: regions in this genome, which I know has
sort of more or less two copies of genes
[SPEAKER_03]: for every copy of a gene here,
and find out, well, yes, there is a region
[SPEAKER_03]: where I found an association between the
trait of interest that is similar to one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the homeologues regions in soybean
where they've also observed similar
[SPEAKER_03]: variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's obviously a nice way of taking
candid genes and figuring out,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, have I seen evidence in some other
species that changes to this gene actually
[SPEAKER_03]: affect the trait of interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so here comes the tough part,
making the case for polynomials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as polyploids involve
multiplication of kind of independently
[SPEAKER_03]: behaving linear genomes, polynomials are
kind of like that in that you're taking
[SPEAKER_03]: together linear factors and if you think
about it in this direction, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: easy to go through and use the
distributive property or things that you
[SPEAKER_03]: learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Lansing High School, so I learned
this from Mr. Cottmell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do the first outside inside last trick
and figure out exactly how to do your
[SPEAKER_03]: factorization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essentially no different no matter
how many factors you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing combinatorial distributive
multiplication and you're essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the roots of the equation and
seeing them come out in the coefficients
[SPEAKER_03]: in kind of interesting ways that these are
what's referred to as the elementary
[SPEAKER_03]: symmetric polynomials, which means that it
doesn't really matter how you permute
[SPEAKER_03]: them, you get the same result.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this ends up being very important in
terms of theory involved in what it
[SPEAKER_03]: actually means to solve a polynomial
equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are numerical techniques that
allow you to approximate solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what algebraic people want to do is to
say, what is the actual algorithm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I find a formula like this old guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably remember the quadratic
equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not exactly simple, but it's fairly
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably remember how to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You either memorized it or you learned
completing the square and can re-derive
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too bad, but once you go even to
a computer to do a cubic equation,
[SPEAKER_03]: things get really a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a Renaissance mathematician,
Tartaglia, who figured out how to deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with these things by first performing a
little trick and making a depressed cubic
[SPEAKER_03]: and then eventually getting to a formula
that in some sense is analogous to the
[SPEAKER_03]: quadratic equation, but it's a lot more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get also interesting things with
higher degree equations like what they
[SPEAKER_03]: call cases irreductible, which basically
means that you can have three real valued
[SPEAKER_03]: roots, but if they're not rational,
you can't actually represent them with
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of representation without
involving imaginary numbers, even though
[SPEAKER_03]: the results that you get are not
themselves imaginary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you start to increase the number of
factors of things, life gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And going even further, it was eventually
demonstrated after people had solved the
[SPEAKER_03]: cubic and the quartic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were working real hard to try to
solve the quintic, and eventually through
[SPEAKER_03]: the work of Abel and Galois, they
discovered that in fact, you can have
[SPEAKER_03]: fifth degree equations and higher,
where you simply can't represent the roots
[SPEAKER_03]: in any way using that sort of
representation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether or not you can get to some
sort of representation like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: is basically dependent on this notion of
symmetry among the roots and how the
[SPEAKER_03]: coefficients impose constraints upon the
roots, whether you can represent
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships among the roots starting
from what they call the field of the
[SPEAKER_03]: coefficients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an example of that would be cyclotomic
polynomials, which sort of distribute
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves in the complex plane around the
circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a kind of a very restricted
form, and it can be shown that any
[SPEAKER_03]: cyclotomic, you can represent the roots in
terms of these kind of specialized
[SPEAKER_03]: quadratic, or not quadratic, but radical
towers from the field of coefficients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, there are other times when
taking together a bunch of disparate
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are simple to deal with,
relatively simple individually,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you try to put them together and
things get complicated quickly,
[SPEAKER_03]: even when you're doing kind of the
multiplication aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a project from which many of
the following examples are taken,
[SPEAKER_03]: an NSF-funded project that we've been
working on to try to take a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: disparate information resources and unify
them in some way.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some technical challenge in
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many sociological challenges to
actually getting something like this to
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I won't go into that too much,
other than to say that many of what I show
[SPEAKER_03]: would not be possible without our
collaboration with many of these groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's my first example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivated peanut, it's a recently formed
allotetraploid that was formed from a few
[SPEAKER_03]: diploid wild species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the original genome sequencing was done
on the diploids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of recognized early on that the
diploids were close enough together that
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be challenging using the
sequencing technologies available at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time if you were to just sequence the
tetraploid directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: To figure out which parts went with which
subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they approached it by figuring out
which were the actual progenitor species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually one of them is sort of
there's only one accession of this species
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they believe that it was transported
down into the range of the other species
[SPEAKER_03]: by prehistoric humans, allowing this
hybridization event that eventually led to
[SPEAKER_03]: the cultivated polyploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it sort of there amidst the
range of the other species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can kind of synthetically create
what the amphideploids, which I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just a fancy way of saying an
allotetraploid from these things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: created synthetically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the strategic approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that there are some,
if you're comparing chromosomes
[SPEAKER_03]: corresponding chromosomes from the two,
they are different structurally in some
[SPEAKER_03]: ways, but there's kind of a clear one to
one correspondence between the two
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the interesting things about
peanut is that because of this extreme
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic bottleneck that it went through,
they think that there was essentially a
[SPEAKER_03]: single hybridization event that ended up
propagating into all of the cult wars that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very non-diverse from a
traditional allelic sense, but
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypically there's quite a bit of
diversity associated with things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was kind of a question for
people as to how is it possible for such a
[SPEAKER_03]: limited genetic base to generate all of
this phenotypic diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they, this was actually something
that they began to see when the diploids
[SPEAKER_03]: were sequenced and compared to data that
was available for the tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially what's happening is that
the two sub-genomes within the cultivated
[SPEAKER_03]: tetraploid are interacting in different
ways such that in some cases you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: segment of one sub-genome that's replacing
the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a representation kind of
showing copy number of the two different
[SPEAKER_03]: homeologous genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we have at the end of chromosome
14, I think it is, from a particular
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of peanut, a place where the B
ancestral genome exists in two copies and
[SPEAKER_03]: the A has been replaced with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other regions where A has been lost,
B has been retained, or the other way
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially what's going, what seems to
be going on to a large extent with peanut
[SPEAKER_03]: is that different patterns of this
interactivity between the sub-genomes are
[SPEAKER_03]: generating this type of phenotypic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were actually able to show that
they made one of these synthetic crosses
[SPEAKER_03]: and kept it going for a few generations
and were actually able to reproduce some
[SPEAKER_03]: of this phenotypic diversity within that
pedigree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, well, okay, if that's the
case, we've got the TIF runner genome
[SPEAKER_03]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we actually see what they were
showing in that diagram using some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: tools that we've produced?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's that so-called genome context
viewer again showing us the two
[SPEAKER_03]: homeologous segments of cultivated peanut
and then the progenitor genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this level, you can see some cases
in which it seems as though the gene
[SPEAKER_03]: content of the two homeologous segments is
reflecting the B genome rather than the A
[SPEAKER_03]: genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it might be a little difficult to
argue that that couldn't also just be
[SPEAKER_03]: vagaries of annotation effects or
misassemblies and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go ahead and select,
say, the gene right at the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosomes, and then look at it within
the context of the tree, you can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: see the pattern fairly clearly in terms of
the sequence level relationships that
[SPEAKER_03]: indeed, in this case, the B genome genic
sequence is much closer to the two copies
[SPEAKER_03]: from the tetraploid than the other genome
sequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can interact with this tool in
ways that collapse down the tree and just
[SPEAKER_03]: those genes of interest and then see that
reflected in the multiple sequence
[SPEAKER_03]: alignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see various places at which
the A genome representative is indeed
[SPEAKER_03]: different from the others at a number of
positions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, if we take another gene
from that same region of the genome,
[SPEAKER_03]: it might reside in a gene family that's a
little bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here again, we've got the B genome with
the two tetraploids taken from the same
[SPEAKER_03]: region and behaving similarly in terms of
tree topology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are other subclades of this tree
with different sorts of patterns
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can pretty easily, using this tool,
again, collapse down to the set of genes
[SPEAKER_03]: that may be of interest in your particular
context and then go in the reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: direction to say, well, let's look at
their genomic content in different
[SPEAKER_03]: contexts and figure out not starting with
the premise that you're looking at things
[SPEAKER_03]: that are all centenic, but asking the
question, how would I group these things
[SPEAKER_03]: given their gene family neighborhoods in
such a way that I see the centenic
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships that exist among members of
this gene family?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess this is the next gene down from
the end of the chromosome that I chose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be our chromosome 14 genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is the other gene family or
other clades that you can see has kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a more complicated picture in terms of the
gene duplications within that region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, some of the aspects of the way
that those sequences appear in the tree
[SPEAKER_03]: may be driven by our annotation sorts of
artifacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we believe that these sorts of tools
are valuable for people who want to ask
[SPEAKER_03]: particular questions that will enable them
to browse the data fairly effectively,
[SPEAKER_03]: even in the context of having these kind
of fairly complicated relationships
[SPEAKER_03]: between and within plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited about our
development of this tool and hoping that
[SPEAKER_03]: other groups will eventually start to pick
it up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so moving on to a different
example of challenges associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a genome sequence project that
we've involved with for a number of years,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually more years than I care to admit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been a bit difficult going,
both for technical and funding reasons,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, so alfalfa, cultivated
alfalfa, is a species that is an
[SPEAKER_03]: auto-tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making life more complicated still,
it's an out-crosser.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of diversity within the
genome itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's related to metacargotrenet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And casula, which is a kind of a model
species for legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you look at something like k-mer
frequency spectra in metacargot,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get a really clean result showing you
a sort of a croissant distribution of your
[SPEAKER_03]: k-mer frequencies, which is what you would
expect from single-copy sequence content
[SPEAKER_03]: classically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can model things about genome size
and heterozygosity, which effectively this
[SPEAKER_03]: has none, using this type of setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you try to do the same thing with
sativa, things get a lot more complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of the set of k-mer peaks that
you're dealing with and your attempt to
[SPEAKER_03]: fit models of those kind of mixed model
distributions of k-mers present at
[SPEAKER_03]: different copy numbers that you're
sampling from a large pool that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: generated from whole genome shotgun
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so one thing that we did in that
context, kind of similar maybe to the
[SPEAKER_03]: peanut genome, there was a diploidized
version of cultivated alfalfa that had
[SPEAKER_03]: been taken from a tetraploid and made into
a diploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought, great, this will be
simpler.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can start with that and then leverage
it to help us when we're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: tetraploid itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we had a lot of different
data sets that we had available.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started thinking it would be easy with
Illumina sequencing, and then as that
[SPEAKER_03]: proved not to be the case, we moved on to
different types of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So packed biosequencing, I'm not exactly
sure how familiar you guys all are with
[SPEAKER_03]: next-gen sequencing, but there are a
number of different technologies,
[SPEAKER_03]: not all of them sequence-based,
but they all have kind of their strengths
[SPEAKER_03]: and weaknesses with respect to getting at
complex genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've tried a number of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that's kind of a little bit
unique about auto-tetraploids in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: using linkage maps is that you do your
linkage mapping typically using,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, single-dose heterozygotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they sort of behave from that
perspective like diploids, where it's this
[SPEAKER_03]: or that segregating, and you can just keep
your eye on the informative haplotype and
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out how it's segregating with other
informative haplotypes from the same
[SPEAKER_03]: linkage group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm maybe trying to stretch that
algebraic analogy, but as you think about
[SPEAKER_03]: roots of numbers that are more than just
the square root, where maybe you think
[SPEAKER_03]: about positive or negative, as you go to
higher roots, you have to think about all
[SPEAKER_03]: of the different directions in the complex
plane that you could be talking about when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about the root of a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things with genotyping get more
complicated as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just trying to get a handle on what the
material was in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is it that we're trying to assemble
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we essentially want to get eight
chromosomes like Medicago has,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though we know there are 32?
[SPEAKER_03]: But for each of the 32, four of them
should be, in some sense, homeologous to
[SPEAKER_03]: one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at some level of diversity from one
another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do we really want a 32 chromosome sort
of pan-genome within the context of our
[SPEAKER_03]: single cultivar of alfalfa?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and in some sense, every time
you create a cross of alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get a different
combination of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some sense, it's kind of quixotic to
try to get the haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're clonally propagating it,
you'll preserve them at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can ask questions about,
you know, is this technology suitable for
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding issues of haplotype phasing
across long distances?
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably not surprisingly, you know,
we found that short-read assemblies were
[SPEAKER_03]: compressing things down a lot,
more towards the expected haploid genome
[SPEAKER_03]: size.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a lot of fragmentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about your N50s relative to
chromosome sizes, they're not looking very
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the long-read technologies,
the contig sizes that we're getting out of
[SPEAKER_03]: those are very small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as small as the short-reads,
but at the level of smallness that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: even challenging to kind of take some of
the other technologies and apply them to
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is that the long-read
assemblies, you know, were definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: producing genomes that were closer to
capturing several of the haplotypes,
[SPEAKER_03]: not maybe all four.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, and even in CATL,
which we had approached as a diploid
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking it would be simpler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was in some sense, but still,
there's a lot of heterozygosity there,
[SPEAKER_03]: and enough that with the high error rates
combined with the heterozygosity,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are a lot of issues with actually
dealing with long-reads and figuring out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, well, is this just a repeat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this just a highly-error sequence,
or is it actually a divergent haplotype?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, when we finally kind of took
one of the long-read assemblies as our
[SPEAKER_03]: base, then we started exploring kind of
higher-order genome scaffolding
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies like optical maps or Hi-C of
various flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the companies we worked with,
Phase Genomics, their algorithm,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, you would tell it how many
chromosomes you wanted to get out,
[SPEAKER_03]: which in some ways seems a little bit of a
danger sign, but, you know, we could tell
[SPEAKER_03]: them, well, we would like to try it with
eight chromosomes, we'd like to try it
[SPEAKER_03]: with 32, and you can see that there were
some significant differences, and I will
[SPEAKER_03]: say, not differences that always made a
lot of sense to us in trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked a little bit about the Kamer
frequency spectra.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, depending on what size you
choose your Kamer at, you will either pick
[SPEAKER_03]: up stuff that is effectively single-copy
across all the homeologs and present at
[SPEAKER_03]: higher frequencies, and then smaller peaks
represent things that are single-dosage or
[SPEAKER_03]: double-dosage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, this progression
as you get closer to using longer Kamers
[SPEAKER_03]: and showing that your peaks, your
higher-order peaks effectively are being
[SPEAKER_03]: erased, you know, is effectively showing
us that within about 71 base pairs,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're gonna get two SNPs that
actually differentiate between all four
[SPEAKER_03]: haplophytes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's quite a complex genome to work
with from an assembly perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you look, so these are the same,
so using 25 MERS as our basis,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're using kind of the Kamer frequency
plots against the actual genomes that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've assembled and looking to see,
well, for Kamers that are in this peak,
[SPEAKER_03]: do we capture them once as expected or
twice, and well, I guess this is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: the, this is the peak of 4X, so it's
shared between all four haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you might expect that to be captured
at 4X.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, again, it's not surprising
that what you see is that the short read
[SPEAKER_03]: data tends to pick up the, you know,
single-copy stuff, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the haplotypes are not being
represented, so they're at 0X.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not really a simple picture,
and even within CATL where the Kamer
[SPEAKER_03]: frequency plot looks a little ragged
because we don't have the same depth of
[SPEAKER_03]: coverage, because we're using packed bio
data, which isn't as deep, and you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: really use it prior to correction,
which is one reason it becomes less deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things look complicated, as you would
expect with a heterozygous genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, BUSCO analysis is something that a lot
of people do to kind of assess how well
[SPEAKER_03]: their genomes have done in terms of
capturing genes that are expected to be
[SPEAKER_03]: present in single-copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, whether or not you expect
it to be single-copy is, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of relative to your expectation for
the ploidy level and the amount of time
[SPEAKER_03]: things have had to become single-copy,
again, following the whole genome
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in terms of genic content,
again, the short-read technologies in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, well, these are different now
assembly algorithms being applied to
[SPEAKER_03]: short-read or long-read, and, you know,
again, you can see that short-read
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies are doing an okay job of
picking up gene content, but just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, basically making a single copy,
whereas the longer-read technologies are
[SPEAKER_03]: picking up two or three copies of these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at genes from M.
[SPEAKER_03]: truncatula just across the board for
things that you wouldn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: expect to be in single-copy, you get a
somewhat similar picture, but definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: more things appearing in multiple,
you know, four or five or higher levels of
[SPEAKER_03]: ploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not a real change, but kind of tendency
to be able to pick multi-copy gene
[SPEAKER_03]: families, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a – well, we had the M.
[SPEAKER_03]: truncatula genome, and prior evidence made
from genetic maps within CTIVA showed us
[SPEAKER_03]: that essentially the two genomes are
collinear, despite the fact that even at
[SPEAKER_03]: the haploid genome size, one is quite
expanded, almost twice as big as the other
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of interesting things
that turn out not to really be about
[SPEAKER_03]: differences between CTIVA and truncatula,
but the particular accession that was
[SPEAKER_03]: chosen for the genome sequencing of
truncatula had some peculiarities,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they show up when you compare it to
other truncatulas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you, you know, essentially try to
use truncatula as your basis, you would
[SPEAKER_03]: expect that it would do a pretty good job
of showing you collinearity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on how fragmented your
assembly is, you know, genome dot plots
[SPEAKER_03]: are a nice way of showing relationships
between different genomes, but when you
[SPEAKER_03]: see something like this, where,
you know, the labels of one axis are so
[SPEAKER_03]: dense that you can't even read them,
it basically just means that you've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of degrees of freedom that you have to
make things look like diagonals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there are real structural events
going on between your genomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not likely to see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you start applying more aggressive
scaffolding technologies, then you get the
[SPEAKER_03]: chance to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this is an example of some
of the things that were coming out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi-C data, where they're doing a pretty
good job of kind of figuring out which
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome a particular scaffold belongs
to, and getting it in the right
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: But effectively, what they're doing,
even when you tell them to kind of produce
[SPEAKER_03]: 32 chromosomes, is not really give you 32
chromosome haplotypes, but give you each
[SPEAKER_03]: of the eight chromosomes in four pieces,
where each of the pieces kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: represents a strange little jumble of all
the haplotypes that you had for that,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the Hi-C data isn't really able of
resolving these kind of haplotype phasing
[SPEAKER_03]: issues, at least not in the hands of the
algorithm that was applied to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just zooming in on this a little bit
more on one of the chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can start to see, on the one hand,
probably some assembly artifacts that are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in from some of the scaffolding
technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not expect this to be a real
relationship between alfalfa scaffold and
[SPEAKER_03]: truncatula.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see another one of those sort of
crow's feet representations there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can also clearly see, you know,
we are picking up fairly good
[SPEAKER_03]: representation of two haplotypes along,
you know, in many cases, along wide
[SPEAKER_03]: stretches, and in some cases, it's a
little bit more fragmented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if we take our, original
non-scaffolded, just long-read
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies, you can start to kind of
trace a picture, but you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees of freedom to make this into
little, you know, sort of line segments
[SPEAKER_03]: that are showing you collinearity.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you apply something like optical
mapping, these lines become much longer
[SPEAKER_03]: and more coherent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these seem to represent
haplotypes, but there's still kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: question about can you really trust that
the phasing that this is sort of saying
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have along your haplotype is
actually accurate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, a bio-nano map doesn't
actually have sequence data associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of a pattern, which we'll
see in another slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the kind of a gomish of
haplotypes that the Hi-C data is producing
[SPEAKER_03]: for this region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, probably in the right general
vicinity, but it's certainly not making a
[SPEAKER_03]: single coherent haplotype as instructed by
the 32 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we apply a Hi-C plus bio-nano,
which kind of allows you to make breaks
[SPEAKER_03]: where necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one limitation of the
non-sequence basis of something like an
[SPEAKER_03]: optical map is that your scaffolds kind of
have to be a certain size to begin with in
[SPEAKER_03]: order for them to get a purchase into the
genetic map, or sorry, not the optical
[SPEAKER_03]: map, which I'll show in another slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, then again, is using the same
tool to look at the haplotypes that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: derived from that region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a just kind of the crow's foot
sort of thing that we were seeing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: dot plot looked at from the genetic
perspective and turned on its side for
[SPEAKER_03]: CATL.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I would consider to be an
artifact scaffold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also see some kind of interesting
things within our alfalfa blocks where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this is just kind of a contig
that the optical map was not able to place
[SPEAKER_03]: probably because it wasn't long enough and
didn't have enough restriction sites to
[SPEAKER_03]: really create a pattern to put it into
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can basically imagine that it fits
right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another example where you have a
little region.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't happen to pick it up using the
kind of Syntony-based way of looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we're using here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But another kind of interesting question,
then again, along the same lines about,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, what do people who want to use an
alfalfa genome really want out of a
[SPEAKER_03]: reference?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the tendency would be to say,
well, let's just choose the longest
[SPEAKER_03]: haplotype and kind of do a minimum tiling
thing and choose the most contiguous and
[SPEAKER_03]: least redundant path through those dot
plots that we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there does seem to be a lot of
evidence that there's gene loss between
[SPEAKER_03]: the different homologs, as some polyploid
theory might lead you to believe could be
[SPEAKER_03]: the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, if you just chose one
representative homolog, then you might be
[SPEAKER_03]: missing important gene content that was
actually present on another one of these
[SPEAKER_03]: copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, as I sort of alluded to
the fact that you've got kind of a pan
[SPEAKER_03]: genome for the price of a single genome
with alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm thinking, you know,
eventually we might come to the place
[SPEAKER_03]: where instead of thinking about single
reference genomes, we think about
[SPEAKER_03]: consolidated references that could
basically take all the four homologs,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of abstract them out into a single
representation that was maximally useful
[SPEAKER_03]: for somebody actually trying to do things
in alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so optical maps turned out to
be a bit of a surprise for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was thinking that they
wouldn't really have enough information to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to distinguish the homologs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we were seeing is that when we
took the original contigs and then started
[SPEAKER_03]: placing them up against the scaffolds that
it would produce, we saw that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of breaking the contigs and
distributing them across different
[SPEAKER_03]: scaffolds in a kind of a pattern that
suggested that maybe what was going on was
[SPEAKER_03]: it was trying to make a haplotype
consistent phasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, this is kind of what optical maps
look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sort of do an in silico digestion of
your sequence data that you've produced
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever, you know, the enzymes that
you're using, you find their cut sites and
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at the pattern that this would
create.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you look at all of the labeled
molecules that you've put together using
[SPEAKER_03]: assembly-like techniques and look at the
patterns that they show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, in this case, we can kind of see
some clear regions where maps created
[SPEAKER_03]: using different enzymes are showing places
where you get a very clear crossover
[SPEAKER_03]: between the sequence scaffold showing a
pattern that's associated with this map up
[SPEAKER_03]: to here and this map up to here and then
switches over to not matching this one,
[SPEAKER_03]: but matching this other one which hadn't
matched before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that seems to be pretty good evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, these things are actually
heterozygous enough that the haplotypes
[SPEAKER_03]: are actually fairly well distinguished
even when you don't have the sequence
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, finally, you know, we're trying to
make use of these genetic maps,
[SPEAKER_03]: and even that's been a bit of a challenge
because the markers that were developed
[SPEAKER_03]: were developed using one of the short read
assemblies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, those short read assemblies kind
of represent little mosaic haplotypes even
[SPEAKER_03]: within the context of, you know,
fairly short stretches of flanking
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what you'd kind of like to do is to
say, well, you know, I know this was a SNP
[SPEAKER_03]: chosen because it had three copies and,
you know, three of the home analogs and
[SPEAKER_03]: one copy of an allele and the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what I really want to do is establish,
you know, what's the informative allele,
[SPEAKER_03]: which linkage group did it go to,
and do it within the context of the
[SPEAKER_03]: linkage phased sort of representation of
those SNPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I also phasing those particular alleles
within the context of sequence analysis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, this is showing us a dot plot
where the different 32 linkage groups
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically are being represented.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that it's fairly collinear
with a little bit of noise off the
[SPEAKER_03]: diagonal showing where a particular
allele, you know, really ought to be in
[SPEAKER_03]: this linkage group that was actually put
into a scaffold with something else that
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't really belong to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, getting down to the
actual sequence level of the haplotypes,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a bit of a surprise to me to see
that at the end of the day, even though we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't really end up using CATL to be kind
of a substrate for working on the higher
[SPEAKER_03]: level, putting together of the tetraploid
genome, when you start looking at the
[SPEAKER_03]: haplotype structure that you have in terms
of the different things appearing in these
[SPEAKER_03]: two genomes, they're actually,
it seems as though you're seeing in some
[SPEAKER_03]: cases at least similar haplotypes
resolving out of those two genomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which to my, I don't know that much about
the history of CATL, but I don't think it
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually really derived in any way
from this material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that was kind of a nice result.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then up here we're kind of showing
what a multiple sequence alignment tool
[SPEAKER_03]: for whole genomes kind of does when you
try to give it things that actually have
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple genome copies, but you're just
sort of saying, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: take this species and align it here,
and I expect there to really be one
[SPEAKER_03]: region, but it's finding that you've given
it several copies of this region with
[SPEAKER_03]: different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of just mashing them into one
consensus-like thing that is much more
[SPEAKER_03]: nicely resolved down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so this is the kind of the last
example, and this represents more recent
[SPEAKER_03]: work that's actually just a proposal that
was recently submitted that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: generating a lot of preliminary data on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, people have been looking
at functional genomics, omics data in bulk
[SPEAKER_03]: tissues for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one, you know, it's great,
it's powerful, it provides us with a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of information, but one problem is that,
you know, in fact, you've got a genome
[SPEAKER_03]: that in some sense is the same in all of
these parts of the plant, but it's doing
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when you aggregate things
together, you can obviously miss
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting things that might be going in
the parts, and sometimes you can just get
[SPEAKER_03]: patterns which are actually the opposite
when you look across the aggregate than
[SPEAKER_03]: the things within the meaningful
subgroupings that you had might have
[SPEAKER_03]: related, and that's called Simpson's
paradox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, you know, well,
if we start looking at things at finer
[SPEAKER_03]: levels of resolution within the system,
a multicellular complex system,
[SPEAKER_03]: will we be able to answer questions that
we couldn't address when we were just
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at things in the aggregate?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is work that Mark LeBeau has been
spearheading.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just kind of giving a little bit more
substance to what I was saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the root systems of these
various species, although they have,
[SPEAKER_03]: in many cases, the same cell types,
where cell type, I'll just let you decide
[SPEAKER_03]: for yourself what that might actually
mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look pretty different in terms of
their structure and the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: components of different types that they
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can kind of easily imagine that
when you're averaging out in kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: different weighted averages across these
different pools, you would not really be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to compare all that easily across
them in meaningful ways if you wanted to,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, look at, even if you had done a kind
of a carefully controlled experiment where
[SPEAKER_03]: you defined, you know, what is the section
of the root that is homologous in
[SPEAKER_03]: Arabidopsis to Mecado, some of these other
things, you know, you may just be limited
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of the actual biology,
in terms of what averaging is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you try to do comparisons in
terms of evolutionary questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: you just might not really have great data
to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So recently, as I'm sure many of you are
aware, technologies that have been around
[SPEAKER_03]: in the animal space for a number of years
have just begun to be applied to plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not that we're slow on the
uptake, it's that we've had real
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges in terms of cell walls and the
ability to actually take plant tissue and
[SPEAKER_03]: dissociate the cells into, say,
contexts in which you can actually do
[SPEAKER_03]: single cell biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But within the last year, a number of
papers have come out, including John
[SPEAKER_03]: Schieffelbein, who's on the previous
slide, who's looked at Arabidopsis root
[SPEAKER_03]: development for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He published a paper using protoplasting
on Arabidopsis root cells and basically
[SPEAKER_03]: created a Arabidopsis root atlas from that
data, as a number of groups, other groups
[SPEAKER_03]: have been looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was recently made aware of an effort
that's, there's a workshop happening soon
[SPEAKER_03]: to kind of start thinking about what it
really means to generate a plant cell
[SPEAKER_03]: atlas, similar to the sorts of atlases
that are being developed in, say,
[SPEAKER_03]: human and mouse and other systems that are
a little bit more mature in terms of these
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's a really exciting area and
something that, you know, I'm hoping that
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll get funded to work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mark's approach has been a little
different in that he's working with single
[SPEAKER_03]: nucleus data rather than single cell or
protoplast and single cell data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a number of the possible advantages to
doing that are enumerated here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the ways that I relate this to
the basic question of polyploidy,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I thank Jeff Doyle for turning me on
to this question about what happens,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, transcriptionally with cells
that have different endopolyploidy levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of these platforms will
have different biases in terms of cell
[SPEAKER_03]: sizes that they're able to actually
incorporate into their microfluidics or
[SPEAKER_03]: their droplets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's at least somewhat minimized
with the use of nuclear data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think at the end of the day,
it's probably just the fact that you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to tune your system as much when
you're trying to go across different
[SPEAKER_03]: species working with the nuclear isolation
protocols.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we will be at a point soon
where we can actually engage in some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the comparative functional omics that we
are hoping that these technologies will
[SPEAKER_03]: really start to bring to bear on these
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're thinking that a lot of the
biological questions, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: may actually have slightly different kind
of takes that you get when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: restricting to yourself to what's going on
in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that could be viewed, you know,
in some cases as an advantage rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly just a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some real challenges to,
you know, when you're going to the single
[SPEAKER_03]: cell level, you're already faced with
challenges with really low amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: starting material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're limiting yourself to only
what's going on from the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's even more challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, one basic question with
using the single nucleus approach is,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, can we even get a picture of these
systems that's comparable in some ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: what's coming, starting to come out of the
single cell studies?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are the kinds of pictures
that are created by some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: informatics systems associated with single
cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, each data point is an
individual cell, and they're being spread
[SPEAKER_03]: out into this kind of two-dimensional
projection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can think about this sort of like PCA,
except PCAs are kind of designed to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at the dimensions that maximize variance
across what are the dimensions across
[SPEAKER_03]: which most variance occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: These techniques are a little bit more in
tune with looking at complex sorts of
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships where neighborhoods are more
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: T-SNE was the one that people kind of
started out using.
[SPEAKER_03]: I first heard about it a couple years ago
at PAG, and already it's been kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: started to be deprecated in favor of more
sophisticated techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in any case, you can see that if you
do kind of a co-clustering that takes into
[SPEAKER_03]: account kind of possible batches or batch
effects between the different experiments,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you project them into the same
space and then separate out the single
[SPEAKER_03]: cell dots from the single nucleus dots,
you get a fairly coherent picture in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of the overall structure where different
areas are populated by both cells and
[SPEAKER_03]: nuclei.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are some things that we're
picking up that don't seem to be present
[SPEAKER_03]: at all in the single cell data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be a case in which there are
just certain cell types that are biased
[SPEAKER_03]: for whatever reason against being picked
up in a photo-plasting approaches that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're able to pick up with the nuclei.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's fun to look at these plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see sort of patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, what you really
want to do is to sort of figure out,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, what are these cell types?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're working in Arabidopsis,
you have marker genes that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: established for cell types over many
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can use the patterns of expression
to kind of tease apart what these clusters
[SPEAKER_03]: likely represent biologically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, in soybean, which is a
paleopolyploid, we're able to sort of do a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar thing, figure out what the
clusters represent, and then start to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at effects of treatments like inoculation
with symbionts and show differential
[SPEAKER_03]: expression between the genes that are in
the same cluster but being affected by the
[SPEAKER_03]: treatments differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I probably won't have too much time to
talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jeff and I have worked since the early
days of NGS sequencing on questions
[SPEAKER_03]: around, well, when you get new polyploids
being formed from hybridization of
[SPEAKER_03]: diploids in these polyploid complexes,
essentially, you call them all telentelo,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're really different species,
different genomes, different combinations
[SPEAKER_03]: of genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What actually happens with the expression
of these homeologs when you put these
[SPEAKER_03]: genomes together?
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you access those questions using
some of these sequencing technologies
[SPEAKER_03]: where sometimes you see one homeolog
effectively gets suppressed and the other
[SPEAKER_03]: one is sort of dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you get things like
sub-functionalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're trying to take the
single-cell data and basically ask those
[SPEAKER_03]: questions by taking the data from the
single cells that's been aggregated across
[SPEAKER_03]: the clusters and then defining indices
that describe, in terms of gene pairs
[SPEAKER_03]: related to one another through homeology
from ancient whole genome duplication
[SPEAKER_03]: events, what are the sorts of patterns
that you can see?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a case where, for this
particular case, if you look at a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular gene pair, sometimes one gene
is the dominant partner, sometimes the
[SPEAKER_03]: other gene is the dominant partner,
and sometimes you don't see any bias or
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't have enough read count data to
really see significant bias.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you see clear preference of one
homeolog over another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then similarly, are different tissues
different in terms of the ways in which
[SPEAKER_03]: they use different homeologs to become the
cells that they want to be through the
[SPEAKER_03]: developmental processes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So finally, in addition to transcriptomic
data, we're using ATAC-seq data,
[SPEAKER_03]: which really is looking at chromosome
structure and how the chromosomes remodel
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves through interaction with the
histones to try to make gene expression
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some integrative techniques
that have been developed similar to what
[SPEAKER_03]: you might use when you're trying to
integrate, say, a data set from one
[SPEAKER_03]: species to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going from one species to a
data set from another species,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're kind of making some assumptions
about what expression would look like with
[SPEAKER_03]: respect to the accessibility of genes that
are being expressed, integrating that way,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then trying to figure out what the
clustering is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can start asking questions
about differential accessibility over the
[SPEAKER_03]: ATAC-seq data aggregated across your
clusters, ATAC-seq being even more sparse
[SPEAKER_03]: than the RNA-seq data is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are the people who I haven't
already mentioned in the course of this
[SPEAKER_03]: talk, but I'd just like to acknowledge on
the various projects and take questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinating talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I have a question about prevalence
of those presence absence variants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you're seeing in other questions.
So one of the things that ended up
happening is autotrash bits ended up
developing a large amount of genetic load
that kind of trace about what the
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalence of those presence absence
variants are and whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_01]: missing pieces that are actually
contributing a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say it's not a question we've
looked at carefully yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't actually done a gene annotation
of the tetrapoid, mostly just for reasons
[SPEAKER_03]: of running out of funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the data I was presenting was actually
taking the truncatula genes and just
[SPEAKER_03]: projecting them onto the tetrapoid and
showing it from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit of guesswork
involved with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of seeing fairly large
deletions present in genetic regions,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you look at individual examples,
I would guess that it's not uncommon to
[SPEAKER_03]: see those types of mutations changes being
maintained within the gene pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you finding in terms of the
similarity in cell clusters between
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean and Arabidopsis, given the
morphological differences you showed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is a question I unfortunately
can't address at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark has been very active in taking the
marker genes that he's studied and just
[SPEAKER_03]: establishing the identity of the cell
clusters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think our soybean data isn't yet
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as good as our Arabidopsis data.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said that the nuclear data would involve
less protocol tweaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there is some protocol
tweaking just in terms of basic sizes of
[SPEAKER_03]: nuclei for the larger genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He mentioned something about
centrifugation being an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm imagining that there are some
bursting issues that he's still working
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Andrew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
