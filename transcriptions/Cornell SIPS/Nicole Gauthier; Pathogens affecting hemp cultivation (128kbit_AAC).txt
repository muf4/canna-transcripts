[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our way, I'm Lucia Vignale, and I'm
organizing the hemp animal webinar this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a third year PhD candidate in the
Larry Smart Lab at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm working with Father Meldus in
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm particularly interested in disease
resistance, so I'm especially excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about your talk, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our speaker today is a long-awaited,
and we're really happy that you accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: our invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The participants, if you registered for
this talk, you know I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nicole Ogochere, I'm sorry if I'm
butchering.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a professor and extension specialist
at the University of Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: her program focuses on disease management
of specialty crops, including fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In her extensional role, she develops
educational and outreach programs to help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers manage disease through
identification, understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystems, and integration of
management strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research program focuses on a range of
hemp diseases, including usarium
[SPEAKER_00]: headlight, as well as sand establishment
and seed borne transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is co-editor of the UAPS, Compendium
of Cannabis Diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her resources can be found in the
University of Kentucky, the Pathology
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension part of the webpage,
and Facebook, and Twitter, and on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many options to follow her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just choose your social media flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I hand over the stage to her,
I want to remind you everyone to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat for saying hi and greetings and other
communications, but please submit the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for Nicole using the Q&A button.
[SPEAKER_00]: The talk will last approximately 40-45
minutes followed by a 15-minute Q&A
[SPEAKER_00]: session, and we'll then wrap up and thank
Nicole for her time and insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the webinars are recorded and will be
uploaded to our School of Integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants Science, SIPs, SIPs, UAPS YouTube
channel, and you can check already the one
[SPEAKER_00]: from last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, Nicole, it's all yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're talking about plant diseases,
as Lucia said, but I'm going to focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: grain hemp today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who knows me has heard any of my
talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what I'm going to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's disease in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today we're going to focus on grain
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I am from the University of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my work happens in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is more of a Kentucky perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not from Kentucky or in a nearby
state, you should be communicating with
[SPEAKER_01]: your extension educators or extension
specialist in your state to assure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got the same diseases and we've got
the same management recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climates are different, planting times are
different, and even disease distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm more Midwest located,
but most of this should apply to everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot start a disease talk of grain
hemp without talking about diseases in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis sativa is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis sativa is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis sativa is the plant that we're
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the common diseases of hemp or grain
hemp are generally the same ones that we
[SPEAKER_01]: see in all cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a range of diseases from damping
off, root rots and crown rots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our root rots can range from those
damping off seedling diseases to something
[SPEAKER_01]: larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crown rots from southern blight,
which I know is all the way in the
[SPEAKER_01]: northeastern US and even into Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a range of diseases from the
same one that we see in the northeastern
US and even into Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vascular wilts, we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium wilt is probably the most talked
about of the vascular wilts in hemp and in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but we don't see that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see surprisingly fewer than the
literature would make us think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Kentucky, we have not found
Fusarium oxysperum, but we have found
[SPEAKER_01]: other species of Fusarium causing a
vascular wilt, which is unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, not a lot of vascular wilts in
the grand scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf spots and blights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a leaf spot is what you see on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spot where as a leaf blight is kind of
that quick death where you see that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf die and it dies really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see lots of leaf spots and blights and
human nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what we tend to zero in on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk a lot about leaf spots and leaf
blights.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, a little bit of a side note,
we did some research here at the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Kentucky looking at various
cultivars of hemp and different leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: spotting diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that regardless of how severe
those leaf spot diseases get, we did not
[SPEAKER_01]: see an effect on biomass yield or
cannabinoid yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, that was a two year study in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there's a lot more to talk about
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not talking about leaf spots today
per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mildews and molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know powdery mildew and downy
mildew and botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are more like colonizers of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't call those leaf spots per se,
but they are leaf diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can infect cannabinoid, grain or
fiber cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm talking specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go beyond that flower,
if we have a pollinated flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have grain that stay on the plant
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so grain diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I'm talking about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, in particular,
I'm going to talk about fusarium head
[SPEAKER_01]: blight today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as much the botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't have that much botrytis gray
mold here in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that in Geneva and in the northern
climates, you'll see more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm talking grain diseases,
I'll be talking primarily about fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: head blight and storage molds,
because anything that moves from the field
[SPEAKER_01]: into storage moves from the field to
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are cases where it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my assignment today is to talk about
common diseases of grain health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this whole list of diseases that I
love to talk about every one, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to focus on damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk about those flower
and grain diseases, mostly one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: because those are the big limiting factors
for grain hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grain hemp is planted differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't transplant into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go into the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow it fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it out fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plant it very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of an agronomic type crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're limited in the number of diseases
we're going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that any of those others won't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the big red flags for me
here in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are major concerns for our
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the ones, if I was invited to
a grower talk, these are the ones that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck is damping off?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, well, pre-emergent disease or
post-emergent that can affect seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: are seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we mean by damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-emergent damping off is when a seed
fails to germinate, fails to emerge,
[SPEAKER_01]: or fails to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pre-emergent, before that seed emerges
per se, we've also got, so it'll die after
[SPEAKER_01]: germination or right before germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pathogens can affect any part of the seed
or seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So post-emergent damping off is after that
seed emerges.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be that seedling stage or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of gray area between what's
pre-emergent, what's post-emergent,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are talking specifically about an early
infection of a seed or seedling by a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil-borne pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's generally the definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we've got a seed that's just
germinating, trying to germinate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and disease coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the center, we have a pathogen that
has infected that seedling, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling collapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the way on the right, well,
now we're questioning whether that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a young plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wanna call that a seedling
disease, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not gonna get caught up in the
minutia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point is, we have early season disease,
very early season disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, these plant pathogens like wet
environments, and that's a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing in the greenhouse if
we're producing transplants or if we plant
[SPEAKER_01]: early in the season in the field to try to
get a jumpstart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soils are usually cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's usually when we see these
damping off diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with probably the most
common of the damping off diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pythium root rot, pythium crown
rot, pythium damping off, or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like me, you can just say pythium because
it's all of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several pythium species that
cause damping off or seedling diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not gonna go into them depending
on what the field is, what the previous
[SPEAKER_01]: crop is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pythium aphanadermatum, we usually see
in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a hot weather pythium,
but I can find it in soils here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pythium or Globus pharyngium
irregular, and Globus pharyngium,
[SPEAKER_01]: which used to be called pythium ultimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect a wide range of different
crops from soybeans to vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, okay, so let's back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium is a water mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a true fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a water mold or an oomycete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means they like water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need water to complete their life
cycle and more water than just dampness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we talk about water molds,
that really is saying something,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the image on the left, you'll see like
a dip in this field, ultimately in this
[SPEAKER_01]: field in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a transplant field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a grain field, but ultimately
what happened is right in the center of
[SPEAKER_01]: that field in that low area where water
stood, we had an outbreak of pythium root
[SPEAKER_01]: rot on those plants and they did not make
it to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So low lying areas, usually more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there is a pythium or a water mold
present, it will be really happy with the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it can infect more easily,
complete its life cycle more easily,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the image on the right,
that is a closeup of roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a container, but this is closeup
of roots that are infected with a pythium
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So notice that we've got some nice white
roots with root hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are not infected yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those brownish gray roots that
have lost trigidity, they're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: slimy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably slough off that cortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be indicative of an infected
root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're examining a seed or seedling,
that color change is usually really
[SPEAKER_01]: distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll dig, not pull, and you'll rinse
gently and you'll be able to see if roots
[SPEAKER_01]: are turgid and nice and white in color or
if they have kind of lesions or dark spots
[SPEAKER_01]: on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll have a crown rot that
might fool us if the roots look good and
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the plant doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's a root rot, you'll be able
to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you something else about pythium
if anybody wants some nerdy pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium likes to nibble at roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you it rots off, kind of it decays
that cortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these images here, they are both,
you'll see the cortex has sloughed off and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see the steel sticking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left-hand image all the way at
the top, if you can see my cursor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see the cortex has sloughed off
right about here and everything beyond it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the steel sticking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's usually indicative of pythium
root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the image on the right,
that's pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are being held upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I realize these roots are pointing
the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we hold them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way our brain works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I hold them to photograph,
that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll see this rat tail root tip
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some others in these images
and that rat tail root means the steel is
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking out and the cortex has sloughed
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost always a pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanna do some self diagnosis,
you need a hand lens or a magnifying glass
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully not a rotted root.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, our next damping off pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Fusarium salani.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not Fusarium oxysporum that causes
Fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a true fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a water mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Fusarium also have wide host ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it wet and warm, but they don't
like water at the same rate that our water
[SPEAKER_01]: molds do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a true fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium salani can cause damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also cause crown and root rots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often the Fusarium infection will be
as a result of some wound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've shown this image before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not talking damping off exactly
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This image is after the fact, but this
grower had a plastic culture system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plastic was so thick and they slit the
plastic instead of burning holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plastic rubbed against the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a hemp stem upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I go again, upside down and you'll
see this lesion here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that pink right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually indicative of a Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that wound Fusarium got in
and you'll see the discoloration working
[SPEAKER_01]: its way up and working its way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a crown rot, if you will,
because it happened at the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some root rot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't show the roots here, but if you,
so before I pulled this plant up,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look in the field, that plant is
dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because that girdling canker on
that crown has affected the uptake of
[SPEAKER_01]: watering nutrients to the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime a whole plant is going down,
you're looking for the common denominator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, it was the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Fusarium salani causes the damping
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in your field, if it's built up in
your fields over the years, and we do have
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that actually on our research
farm, then you will see damping off at
[SPEAKER_01]: planting and you could also see it
affecting later in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost always associated with wounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be insect wounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be mechanical wounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our third and final damping off
pathogen is rhizoctonia salani.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call this one rhizoc, R-H-I-Z-O-C.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way we talk about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also a soil-borne disease with a
very wide host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhizoctonia salani can cause damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also cause a crown and root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty nerdy for a plant pathologist
is this one can cause a web blight or an
[SPEAKER_01]: aerial blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say that rhizoctonia salani also
has a very wide host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's in the field, if it's built up
in numbers, if it's wet, and warm at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the season, excessively wet,
not as wet as a water mold, but still wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can come in as a damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a rainy, hot summer,
this one loves to move its way up into the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The image on the left, that is a crown
rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that mycelia, that fungal
white body that is on that crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom part of that picture on the
left, that is like a cross section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a cut into that crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will see, again, you see that
white mycelia, that white fungal body
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, that is web blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is when that fungus, that
soil-borne fungus, moves from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moves up into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens, again, when it's hot and
rainy in the summertime, and when that
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy is so dense and there's no air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you'll see that web blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that mycelia, that white fungal body,
moves its way up into the canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's weaving its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost stitching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stitching those leaves together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks a lot like a spider web,
but it's stitched those leaves together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rhizoctonia salonii can cause damping
off, and it can lead to additional later
[SPEAKER_01]: season diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, very wide host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's built up in the field with
other crops, it will be there when you
[SPEAKER_01]: come in with your green hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you rotate out of hemp and you
rotate into another host plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have not broken that disease cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about these host ranges,
it matters because as we rotate,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where we're going to see some
management options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm switching to disease number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you I'm only talking about two
diseases today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a Fusarium head and bud
blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is when we get to the flowering
and the grain stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a big one for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a big one throughout Midwest
and east of the Mississippi River.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing more and more of it as we're
growing more hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on our 10th year of hemp here in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started growing it in 2014 on that 2014
form bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have completed 10 years of field
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 2017 or 2018, we have seen more
and more Fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're especially seeing it in grain
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of heads up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium head blight is best known as a
disease in cereal crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fusarium head blight or wheat scab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it in wheat, in cereal grains,
and in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, Fusarium head blight or
bud blight if you don't have grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it head blight if it's got grain
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud blight if it's a floral cultivar or a
non-pollinated cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pathogens that cause Fusarium
produce mycotoxins that can be detrimental
[SPEAKER_01]: or dangerous for humans and for animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some very common ones are Don and T2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two Fusarium mycotoxins that are
regulated in cereal grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not to that point in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on that with our research
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these mycotoxins, again, we are
working on test kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is another reason why Fusarium
head blight is a problem for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Kentucky and in neighboring states,
we have surveyed hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have determined that Fusarium
griminiarum, Fusarium avanaceum,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium sporo-trinkeoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Fusarium incornatum equizeti species
complex are the most common causal agents
[SPEAKER_01]: of Fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium griminiarum is the one that
everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one we talk so much about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And griminiarum and sporo-trinkeoides are
what we call the trichothecine producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where those dangerous mycotoxins
are going to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium head blight, though, also causes
a blight of the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the image on the right, we will see
where the disease is there closest to the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem, where that bud or that head is
dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's limited air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's some closer looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that picture again on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blown up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So infection will begin near the stem,
like I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll get my cursor here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will begin near the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where it is dense, where there's
limited air circulation, probably a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: higher humidity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the disease will start to
develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In wheat, Fusarium head blight is known to
infect through the male flower parts
[SPEAKER_01]: during anthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have found that infection will
occur pretty much any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a lot more disease,
a lot higher amounts of fungal DNA during
[SPEAKER_01]: the reproduction active phases of this
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no indication that male flowers
are driving that infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, we have tested male
flowers, and they can be equally
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is not affecting us here as we
talk about grain and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium head blight looks a lot like
damage from some of your bud worms,
[SPEAKER_01]: like corn earworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be really careful if you're
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take a closer look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're not seeing that frass or
those bud worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this picture on the left, that looks a
lot like bud worm damage to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to actually spread out that
flower or that head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to look inside and looking
for that white mycelia, that colonization,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you'll see as a progression of
symptoms of that blighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if it was a bud worm, you would
see chew marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would see where there's that
girdling happening as a result of those
[SPEAKER_01]: chew marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so here are some additional pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to drive this home a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That here on the right, you'll see that
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that mycelia, that white fungal
stringy body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, there's that spread,
spreading inside that head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it moves up, everything above it
pretty much dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll start to see that that blighting
occur at a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The image on the left, that entire head
blighted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rainier it is, the more of this
mycelia you'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's dry, you'll have disease spread
inside the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you won't see as much of that mycelia.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do see that fuzzy mycelia
colonizing, it can be confused with
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, here in Kentucky,
we're not seeing gray mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not finding botrytis in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we see this fuzzy
colonization, it's almost always Fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: head blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a northern climate where it's
cool, especially as fall kind of comes
[SPEAKER_01]: around and we start seeing those cool
nights, you could very well have botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Kentucky, and definitely further
south than us, we're not seeing botrytis
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the amount of mycelia will vary
by the species of Fusarium that's
[SPEAKER_01]: infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we see Incornata mequiceti gets
really fuzzy, kind of like on the left,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas usually the Grumminiarum has a lot
less of the mycelia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, don't let that fool you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to know what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, depending on the weather,
will really affect the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: colonization and the spread of disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium head blight causes, as you see,
direct losses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the blighting of those grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the blighting of that head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see early shattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a direct loss by Fusarium head
blight and then that indirect loss,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be those mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have kind of a double whammy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I want to mention bud
architecture or head architecture here
[SPEAKER_01]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are seeing, and this is a little bit
anecdotal, but we are seeing a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: head blight in those heavy, dense buds as
opposed to the kind of spindly ones where
[SPEAKER_01]: we have more air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing this in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our colleagues around the US are
saying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not tested that theory yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Undoubtedly, there is genetic resistance
in there, not complete resistance that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know of, but there are definitely
cultivars that are more susceptible than
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add that bud architecture
where we don't have good air circulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially as those buds get dense and
they stay really wet and humid inside the
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have an either or going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am inclined to say that we have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is work that we need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I want to mention this is one of our
research field plots from last year or two
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking for time of infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said that in wheat, that infection
occurs around in thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when that male flower blooms,
that male flower part is exposed on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That here in Kentucky happens in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even planted our hemp yet in
May.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, how do we have so
much Fusarium head blight during the
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive phase, which is usually
August in hemp when in thesis and
[SPEAKER_01]: infection on wheat happens in May and
wheat is out of the field in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we understand that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking for time of
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did hemp become infected?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do that, we planted this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only part of the field,
but we planted every two weeks starting in
[SPEAKER_01]: April.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we planted every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use three cultivars, an early,
a mid and a late season cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that basically gave us different
growth stages at every planting date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were aiming for is to compare
time of planting, calendar time of year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then plant growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what we were aiming to
uncover.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, so our results were basically
that latent infection occurred as early as
[SPEAKER_01]: May.
[SPEAKER_01]: So latent infection is that dormant stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time between infection and
symptom development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants were becoming infected very
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were becoming infected during the
vegetative stages, but not showing
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So infection was there once in this
particular experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, you do see a wheat cover crop
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we ensured that we would get
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so high inoculum load in these fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a drill seed on a wheat cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this wheat did not go to seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a wheat cover crop, which adds
another layer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question, because if this wheat
never went to flower, if this was a cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, it never went to flower,
then it shouldn't have been infected
[SPEAKER_01]: either, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I digress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had latent infections early,
not a lot, but enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our highest amount of infection and
then symptom development started occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: during reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants were highly susceptible during
that reproductive stage, even though they
[SPEAKER_01]: were even though they were not that that
anther there, like like the wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the month didn't really matter and the
days after planting did not really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that plant growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that reproductive stage where
plants were highly susceptible and we got
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we identified we quantified the amount
of DNA in that plant before symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then any time there was rain,
we had spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some weather data layered into
that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So weather spiked it, but infection was
occurring lower levels during the
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: As early as May, but it was August during
those reproductive stages, mostly those
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive stages where we had severe
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of thrown a lot at you just
to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we are with this
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing we asked is where it came
from, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed you the wheat and as you see the
center picture and the one on the left,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is another wheat cover crop that did
not go to seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we so we planted hemp,
we drill seeded hemp into this wheat cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sporulation events, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When were the spores released?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that Fusarium can infect grassy
hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely know it's a major disease in
in Gram and Nicholas crops, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So wheat and cereals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be very high inoculum loads if
you have a full wheat crop, but we weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so is is Fusarium in this case,
Fusarium Griminierem overwintering what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how is it surviving?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it surviving on the previous crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there debris?
[SPEAKER_01]: And did our wheat cover crop have Fusarium
head blight?
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no symptoms, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our experiments here is we used wheat
as a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had three fields with wheat as a
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had three fields with like a mustard
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had three fields that were
tilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like your traditional tilled field,
cultivated field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a severe drought again here in
Kentucky in twenty twenty four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got up into the upper 90s, which is
unusual for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still had and you see there are
spore traps on the photo on the right and
[SPEAKER_01]: the photo on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see some spore traps going on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from those spores traps, we had a very
high inoculum load or spore spore
[SPEAKER_01]: detection, especially in our wheat cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we didn't have grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have that time event thesis and
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did not have disease on our wheat
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a higher spore load in that wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We so so we had less less disease in the
mustard and the tilled treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so what is so what is our so what
is our our conclusion here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had we did not have wheat in thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was tilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was terminated in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't plant until June and
then drought in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by August, it was hot and dry,
but we had lots of spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in turn, we had lots of DNA present in
in those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not have a lot of disease,
but we had that DNA there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does all this mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does all this matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds can get infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So besides our direct our direct loss,
right, shattering blighted seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds can get infected and our hemp seeds
being infected can mean a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have we have to tease those apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we plant higher populations in the
field, whatever we have left can still
[SPEAKER_01]: become infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blight can be really severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have direct losses or seeds can be
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these images here show contaminated
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds are not viable if we're using
them for if we're using that grain for
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, is we're moving into
the space of hemp grain as an animal feed
[SPEAKER_01]: and even as human human food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eat hemp hearts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eat we do eat that grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about mycotoxins?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we not talking about mycotoxins?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have mycotoxins?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the previous field, so we have
several studies where Henry Smith was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at mycotoxins and he's definitely
finding Dawn and T2 levels above those
[SPEAKER_01]: thresholds for human and animal feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those toxins are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not regulating them and we're not
managing disease very well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're storing this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out of our field and we're
storing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is floral hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all in all, we're storing hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diseases that are in the field,
the toxins that are in the field are
[SPEAKER_01]: moving from the field into storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have Fusarium head blight or
Fusarium bud blight on cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it in grain hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we get into storage, depending on
the level of humidity, we can keep we can
[SPEAKER_01]: have disease spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have the fungus colonizing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can have increases in the
amount of mycotoxins, especially if that
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity is high during storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photo all the way on the right and the
photo all the way on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are tobacco barns here in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're hanging hemp just like they
hang tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the image in the center that is a
greenhouse grower who is using some old
[SPEAKER_01]: racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, all of these scenarios
have high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do know is that in wheat,
that Fusarium griminiarum will continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: colonize and grow on wheat as low as 22
percent relative humidity, 22 to 25
[SPEAKER_01]: percent relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have that active fungus in store
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that wheat has to be dried to
12 percent or lower in order to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing that in hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing that with our hemp grain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing that with our cannabinoid
hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that can be another
recommendation, right, is to hurry up and
[SPEAKER_01]: dry that grain down before those
mycotoxins can continue to multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some examples of how we see hemp
stored post harvest, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the buds stored and in terms of floral
hemp, we have some ground biomass that is
[SPEAKER_01]: inevitably making its way into to hemp
feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I told you that we eat hemp grain,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some chocolate that I bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is that those are hemp hearts in
that chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're eating hemp grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're feeding it to our animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: New here in Kentucky and even in the
equine industry, up to 30 percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 percent hemp feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then laying hens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to treat this grain like we
treat other grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to manage disease like an
agronomic crop that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to manage disease and we need to
manage this grain just like we do our
[SPEAKER_01]: grain, our agronomic grains or cereal
grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that breeding efforts are underway.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, at Cornell, there is a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have breeding programs that several
sites scientists are looking at breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to make sure that we're
breeding against Fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breeding for sorry, Fusarium
headlight resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very important disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to look further at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need seed treatments for damping off
and we need to be able to manage diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, again, the damping off and
the Fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so with that, I'll close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of resources available for
a lot of other diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put our UK Department of Plant Pathology
webpage here so you can go to that webpage
[SPEAKER_01]: and then hit extension and resources on
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: My handle is at KY Plant Disease on pretty
much any of your social media platforms
[SPEAKER_01]: and at Nicole Goche on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 10 years worth of research piled
up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work on a lot of specialty crops,
so you'll see a lot of specialty crop
[SPEAKER_01]: resources here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to plug that very last URL.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am part of a working group that I
work with scientists at Cornell as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Chris Smart in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are developing a national resource,
a curated database for our growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of research out there,
not just at Kentucky, but in other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, Lucia, we will take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've asked people to ask their
questions using the Q&A button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see them or would you like me to
read them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled them up, but let's make sure that
maybe you can read them so I don't skip
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the first question says or comment
says, hello, Nicole, thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching us.
[SPEAKER_00]: General question on this topic is fiber
hemp comparable to grain hemp in its
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen susceptibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really look at well,
our fiber hemp is harvested before grain
[SPEAKER_01]: develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely have damping off diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets all the same diseases,
but fiber hemp goes in and out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: field so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, the damping off diseases,
those seed and seedling diseases would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be those to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fiber hemp is not resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really not in the field when
we're having these problems or we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: counting it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one says, thanks, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you normally recommend the growers till
to manage disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so usually till no till is a form of
practice and farmers have adopted that for
[SPEAKER_01]: other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really are not making those
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have seen, though, is that cover
crops like mustards or clovers might or
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely going to be that better option
if we're talking about inoculum buildup,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have we have one year's data on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of fusarium head blight in
the wheat cover crop versus the mustard in
[SPEAKER_01]: the tilled are very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not saying no cover crops,
but we definitely have a correlation
[SPEAKER_01]: between wheat as a cover crop and the
amount of fusarium head blight in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is about Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attacks the root cortex and leaves
behind the root steel root center tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's decaying that cortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cortex kind of rots off,
sloughs off, and that steel just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stays there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is affecting that steel to a point,
but it's that soft cortex that sloughs
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of more of our indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that the steel is not
affected, but the cortex is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: affected first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really prominent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see it, you'll get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So play around with it this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you don't have Pythium,
but if you do, you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plant stem and leaves are
affected, for example, by rhizoctonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the plant still flowers and produces
grain, is that grain still fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so generally, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, a crown rot will stay at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have a web light coming up,
we usually see that more in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, not as much in grain cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rhizoctonia can affect grain,
but it's unlikely it'll get that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, rhizoctonia is at the base of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it gets hot and dry, and that
crown is infected, and that girdling
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs, you'll usually see a collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jocelyn is curious about the balance
between disease management and
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tough one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really tough one, because we do
want cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want these no-till systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to understand the limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, if we're rotating our
fields, if we're using cover crops that
[SPEAKER_01]: are not cereals, we can definitely get
around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm not saying don't use cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any time we have a disease epidemic,
we have to start questioning all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: other practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But crop rotations are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to rotate with non-host, hopefully,
we're really bringing that inoculum level
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to find other cover crops,
I would love to look at a wider range of
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops, because we were quite
surprised that a wheat cover crop that
[SPEAKER_01]: never went to grain or flour had that high
of an inoculum load.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jocelyn, you'll be seeing Henry's talk
probably at APS or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll be able to see those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose your cover crops wisely then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it common that headlight can be
acquired via pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that when I do control
breeding, the pollinated heads sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: mold where the surrounding flowers aren't
noticeably affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can pollen be combined with a controlled
bacteria to prevent the mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think fusarium headlight moves by
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can double back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can check on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can double check on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, can pollen be combined with a
controlled bacteria to prevent mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at biologicals to see if
there are some of our biological agents
[SPEAKER_01]: that are effective against fusarium
headlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we have not had efficacy in any
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are we spraying at the right times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we using those products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correctly, we have research in the
pipeline that we want to look at for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, we haven't seen any of the
commercial biological products,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the bacillus products,
that are effective against fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: headlight during flowering and grain
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: More work to be done on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next common question is, what passes
feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's outside of my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has been talk that perpenes and
even some of the cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: antifungal bacteria, hemp and cannabis,
as we see it, is an agronomic crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horticultural crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is susceptible to lots of different
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do not see where.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know the answer to,
specifically, your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see lots of disease across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you manage the diseases in hemp,
since there are few, if any, fungicides
[SPEAKER_00]: registered for use on hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're waiting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a program called IR4,
where we're working to get some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, some are in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's any that are going
to target fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely have one right now in
trials that hopefully will get some
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling in the next couple of years for
pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some also in the pipeline
for other fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to manage disease when we
have a very new crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have limited research.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years is not a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, we'll have more products on the
market in the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, we're trialing everything
that we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get honest answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any university research, unbiased,
we have nothing to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check with your universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check for any university research that you
can get your hands on that will tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: what's working, what's not, and all of
that gradient in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we're working towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there, but not as fast as we
all want it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen more incidence of fusarium
on Venetians than female individuals due
[SPEAKER_00]: to senescent male flowers in the grain
pad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, the male flowers have died off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have detected latent infection in male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, once that head starts to
develop, the female head is securely in
[SPEAKER_01]: its reproductive phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, when you have that
very dense head or bud where you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of air circulation,
you've got that high moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I talked about architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see a correlation per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, male flowers are kind of gone
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you distinguish between fusarium
and botrytis infection in the flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a hand lens, so any kind of
magnification lens, you can usually see
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrytis will look like a little tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll have a stalk, and it'll have some
little structures on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more of a gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you train your eye, you can sort
of see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fusarium is generally white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gray mold is typically gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just look far back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You at least have to have a hand lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're a commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely use a diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like looking at things under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love looking at things under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with hand lenses, and they're always in
our pockets, in our bags, in our cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we want to teach you to do it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're like less than $10 if you get
them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can sometimes get like a 40x.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine are usually a 20x.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get them usually 40x or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, under $10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should have lots everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question is related to a
previous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read it just in case you want to add
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that Manisha's green
dual-purpose cultivars may be more
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to headlights than the Isha's
cultivars because of the early senescent
[SPEAKER_00]: male flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not seen that correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't looked really closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't seen that correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not absolute.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to recognize reproductive stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Male flowers are flowering, or female
flowers, or time of growth, or something
[SPEAKER_00]: else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I understand the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say that it started flowering for
males versus females?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk about reproductive stages,
I'm talking about that density.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're talking about grain hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about that heavier,
denser bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not those early initials where you'll
start seeing those, you know, questioning,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this a male or a female flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about later than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about when you've got that
dense bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when you're in that field and you
start getting that condensed growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, again, we've done that latent
infection study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've kind of looked at a lot of different
stages, that early reproductive,
[SPEAKER_01]: mid, and later reproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is more of a much later stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working on the data right now
for that latent infection study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to submit it for publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're making me question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look at that and see if
there's anything that we know about those
[SPEAKER_01]: very early reproductive stages versus the
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best cover crops,
grasses, or leguminous options in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: to break the cycle of pathogens like
Fusarium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's not a grass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if Fusarium headlight infects grasses
or graminicolous hosts or cereals,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the ones you don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that legumes can become
infected, but it's not really likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't looked at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say breaking that cycle from
a cereal-based cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm basing this on the research
that we have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not done a widespread cover crop
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that one with just the three,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The mustard, the tilled, and the wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of other things we can
ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even know across the cereals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is barley a better cover crop than wheat?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, we're just saying that it
appears that your cereals are definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to inoculum load,
even if they're used as cover crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: not let flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp is not a monocot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how this is playing along, that's a big
question, too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like we're planning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are breaking the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're planting a dicot followed after that
monocot wheat cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still get it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is suggested to water content in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a suggested soil moisture range
that can be maintained in a greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid fusarium or any of these diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your soil moisture content is going to
drive plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and fusarium is not a soil borne
disease, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is in debris, but then it moves up
into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil moisture should not correlate to
the amount of fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's moisture, but that's more of
a humidity thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think you can reduce your soil
moisture enough to adequately reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that they keep coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is about the reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are reporting and we are going to
upload it in the coming days to our School
[SPEAKER_00]: of Integrative Plant Science YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've added the link to the chat so you can
find it in the chat part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is, what kind of seed
treatment can we do to reduce dumping off
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other crops, we have seed
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: In hemp, we do not have a seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a student that is looking at some
seed treatments with some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where that's going to take
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe if there is a seed treatment or
at least an at planting drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that we can get a seed
treatment product in our IR4 rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the labeling program that I was
talking about, but we are definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just finished two years of looking
at products that are effective against
[SPEAKER_01]: pythium and the water molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully maybe we can have a label for
drenching in greenhouses and fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I hope in the next couple of
years, but definitely greenhouse and field
[SPEAKER_01]: was our target because we know that
pythium is affecting lots of different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of cannabis production, not just
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a perfect follow up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your recommended treatments for
fungal infection in hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to mention the products,
that's for later for the publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me this year to finish that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am working on several projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Dr. Smart and I have some that
are kind of going on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully by next winter, we'll be able
to have some solid recommendations for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make any recommendations
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So biologicals are hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that biologicals are often
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they induce resistance,
but a lot of times they are alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know how to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do they persist on plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if it's hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if it doesn't rain?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if it rains too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to learn how to use biologicals is a
whole other layer of questions because
[SPEAKER_01]: those of us who are trained with
conventional fungicides, we put them on
[SPEAKER_01]: and they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas biologicals have a different
dynamic and we have a lot to learn there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terrific talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is grain hemp as sticky as cannabinoid
types?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wondering how that might affect
airflow and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are sticky, but not as sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still some of our grain
cultivars can have those heavy grain
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, we're planting them closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a different architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very high population rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very straight up plants,
very condensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I had any images in my
PowerPoint, but yeah, planted very close
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no air circulation in those
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we're not even planting
them on rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're broadcast planting or we're
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those rows are very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no air circulation going on by the time
reproductive phases hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's really tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found some cover crops are better
than others for seed establishment?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't really looked at cover crops,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually it's the agronomist who look at
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we just have our one year of
data with the wheat and mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of new for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, with any great experiment
comes a thousand new questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have as many questions as you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to repeat that experiment with
the mustard, wheat and tilled,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't know what our future looks
like in terms of different cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can think of a lot of great ones,
but I don't know where our priorities are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mix of disciplines, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there are so few of us
working on hemp and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: funding sources are difficult and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to prioritize and we want
to do everything yesterday and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't quite fall that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we wish it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is 50 Fahrenheit and wet a good
temperature for dumping off?
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend warmer soil temperatures for
planting, but some are advocating for
[SPEAKER_00]: early spring planting in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of your pathogens like cool
temperatures, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about Pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of your Pythiums can infect really
early in that cool wet soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others like Rhizoctonia like it when it's
hot and wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of lumped them all together
today just for time's sake, but definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: the slower a plant establishes,
the longer it is in that seed and seedling
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the longer exposure you have to any
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of those cool season pathogens that
are there, whatever those may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be even some opportunistic
pathogens if that seed or seedling is just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of lingering there with that very
slow spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really about getting that plant
off to a good start and getting that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into a vegetative stage as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're better off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I didn't really answer your
question, but there are definitely some
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens that can infect at 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warmer is always better for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep that in mind too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed the first part of the webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you discuss Botrytis and its control?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not discuss Botrytis today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about Botrytis in other programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the Cornell group has discussed
Botrytis in some of their programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not do that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from kind of from damping off to
Fusarium headlight because those are grain
[SPEAKER_01]: focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of Botrytis here in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see Botrytis in the greenhouse,
especially early season and late season,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't really see Botrytis in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only comment was that a lot of times if
growers tell me they have Botrytis and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll follow up, it's often Fusarium when
they're seeing that colonization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on where you are,
talk to your extension educators,
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to your diagnostic lab and find out
because they can look similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's great that you don't have
Botrytis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one will complain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have any plant viruses
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of the other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we trade them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of rotation schemes are there
and what is the rotation length?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing associated with the field in
which you've been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have not looked directly at
rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on what your disease pressure
is, is going to dictate what your
[SPEAKER_01]: rotational partners are, what type of
plants are you willing to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to grow sugar beets or are
you going to grow sugar cane or are you
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow cereals or tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So rotation is dependent on the farms,
on the farms production type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually we always say it standard,
a three year rotation cycle will break a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease cycle most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you're not breaking a cycle if
you plant another susceptible host behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was talking about when I
talked about Pusarium headlight in cereals
[SPEAKER_01]: and in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every disease is going to have its own
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the major disease concerns on
your farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you willing to rotate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have enough land to rotate for
three years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have something really severe,
right, like Pusarium wilt, your rotation
[SPEAKER_01]: might be longer than three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three years is kind of our standard
rule of thumb rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, talk to your local extension
educator, explain what your farm does and
[SPEAKER_01]: and make those decisions on what your
rotation partners are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But using your diagnostic lab will confirm
what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shot in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always want to know what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're armed with information to move
forward and make some real decisions that
[SPEAKER_01]: make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of diseases now, your insects and
your pest, that's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we later on weeds fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have disease only.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to species, would you agree
that the all spores are capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling through the air, making
prevention a must?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium and your soil borne pathogens move
through soil and plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're talking about movement of of
any soil borne pathogen, Pythium included,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were thinking about the way you move
soil and soil particles because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: hitchhiking in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the bottom of your shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on your tractor tires.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the wheels to your cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on your dirty implements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the bottom of your muddy jeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you're moving your soil
borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can talk about rusts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get up into the into air currents and
they move long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusariums can move long distances,
but your soil borne pathogens are moving
[SPEAKER_01]: through soil and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is surface drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they're hitchhiking in soil
particles or we're bringing the in if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're if you're a cannabinoid grower,
bringing them in and out with plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of we have a lot of Pythiums
in our fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the question was about Pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so much Pythium in our fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have in our field that we
sample that I was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have four or five of the
species in our field that we that we
[SPEAKER_01]: sampled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in an agronomic field, we have just
been, you know, we're monoculturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of them and they've built
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we are worried about movement,
think about you, the farmer or humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we're moving our soil borne
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult to get rid of them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are they are the most
challenging, absolutely the most
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we talk about them so much
because we're all stumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we talk about them so much,
because it is really difficult and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to break that disease cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is verticillium a common disease in hemp
in the Kentucky region?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't have much verticillium at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've never seen verticillium in
lettuce or vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rarely do we see verticillium in
anything but red buds and woody plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never seen it in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's are you OK with time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question is, what can be done
to eliminate lessen cesarean before
[SPEAKER_00]: storage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Disease management in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what does that mean if we don't have
our fungicide arsenal?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a way we can use cultural
practices, is there there's a way we can
[SPEAKER_01]: start breaking or lessening disease
cycles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking about, you know, again,
our wheat cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we get hemp in storage,
we're talking about grain, we need to dry
[SPEAKER_01]: it down really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about flowers,
we're not drying it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not to 12 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it depends on what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's grain, we need to dry it
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Faster we dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever we bring in, that's what
we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want to dry it down so it
doesn't increase after storage,
[SPEAKER_01]: after you get into storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of diseases do you normally see
in indoor growing facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can it be corrected once it is spotted
during the drying process?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'm looking at that as two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In indoor growing facilities, we usually
see pythium root rots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually see botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you introduce anything in,
we can have some other soil borne
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens that are removed in with
contaminated media, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are usually the big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spot diseases during the drying
process, how can it be corrected?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plant pathogens need humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need free water to complete their
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can dry down, we're slowing or
stopping fungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just talking about fungi and
stopping that fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so drying it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it depends what the crop is
because grain hemp is very different than
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber hemp, very different than
cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does dry mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be very different things
between the grain and the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So drying it down, but there's no
fungicide or there's no treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last question that we have is,
aren't there feral cannabis populations
[SPEAKER_00]: growing around Kentucky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have gone, I have gone on searches
and I have followed leads and I have not
[SPEAKER_01]: found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working with a couple of breeders
and some feral hemp programs and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: not found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky was a hemp seed growing state for
World War, during World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do not, I do not know of any feral
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody finds one or has a lead,
I'm happy to go chase it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have come up short in the past when
going out to collect for a collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they are, I hope you find them at
some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, it would be great if we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always happy to go to follow a
lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a breeder, I don't know whoever
the question came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a breeder, I'm happy to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to go searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it came from an academic
setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not the only one chasing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was the last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good to see everybody or not see
everyone right to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish everybody the best of luck this
growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you do not have cesarean
headlight or damping off disease in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And follow Nicole in her social media
platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we will put some of those handles and
links in the description when the video
[SPEAKER_01]: gets posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice rest of your week.
Goodbye.
Bye.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
