[SPEAKER_08]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I'll start right in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep this, my talk,
to actually about 30 minutes, because we
[SPEAKER_04]: have some new farmer videos talking about
climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to reveal one of them to you
today at the end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to save the 10 to 15 minutes
at the end of my talk to flip to a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of just hearing from me,
you can also hear from some farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to point out a couple websites
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't seen the climatechange
.cornell.edu website, I urge you to go
[SPEAKER_04]: there and subscribe to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you announcements of things that
are happening, a lot of stuff about for
[SPEAKER_04]: students, courses, research going on on
campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the home website has lots of
interesting features on what's in the news
[SPEAKER_04]: about climate, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second website here,
the climateinstitute.kels.cornell.edu,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's our new Cornell Institute for
Climate Change and Agriculture website,
[SPEAKER_04]: which has a lot of cool stuff related
particularly to my topic today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I'm going to focus mostly for this
group.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to focus mostly on the issues
associated with the Northeastern US.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have a few slides on the global
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will be giving a seminar next
semester in February in the CFAD seminar
[SPEAKER_04]: series to get more into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought we should start with the
bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the challenge we face, regardless of
climate change, whether or not we had
[SPEAKER_04]: climate change, is we're going to,
by 2050, we're going to need 60% more
[SPEAKER_04]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to have to be produced
for an expanded population, also changing
[SPEAKER_04]: diets.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is changing the demands on resources
and impacts on the environment as people,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, increase meat consumption in
certain developing parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: That increases the impacts on the
environment and resources, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a lot more food.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be on limited land and
water resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: 75% of that increase in food is going to
have to come from producing more food from
[SPEAKER_04]: the same amount of land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And already, about 70% of the potential
for irrigation has been exhausted,
[SPEAKER_04]: many experts feel, across the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, climate change greatly exacerbates
this challenge, because we add to that new
[SPEAKER_04]: problems with heat stress in some regions,
changing pest dynamics, flooding and
[SPEAKER_04]: drought, as I'll go into today in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the adaptation capacity to climate
change is very unequal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's financial barriers in many parts
of the world, technological, and also
[SPEAKER_04]: perception barriers about climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: This slide just illustrates the added
challenge of climate change with regards
[SPEAKER_04]: to water.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, even without climate change,
our water resources are limited in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of trying to meet that future goal by 2050
of feeding the world's population,
[SPEAKER_04]: as hopefully we stabilize around 2050 at
maybe $9 billion or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is showing climate change projections
of parts of the world in the orange,
[SPEAKER_04]: where we're actually expecting less
rainfall in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: The climate models are projecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue areas indicates slight increases.
[SPEAKER_04]: The white areas, little change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this, of course, greatly adds to
the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even in those areas, such as if
you look at where New York is,
[SPEAKER_04]: where maybe there's little change in
annual rainfall predicted for the future,
[SPEAKER_04]: the water demand is going to increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: With longer growing seasons, with
increasing temperatures, the crop
[SPEAKER_04]: evapotranspiration and natural vegetation,
it's potentially T, is going to be going
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless you have an increase in rainfall
to keep up with the increase in water
[SPEAKER_04]: demand, there's challenges for more
drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, in these areas in orange,
we're on top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not seeing the same amount of
rainfall, but actually reductions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenge is big indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a story for the Northeast,
and in kind of a nutshell, looking at a
[SPEAKER_04]: range of climate models and their future
predictions on the left-hand side for
[SPEAKER_04]: annual temperature, and on the right for
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there's error bars around
both of these with the different models
[SPEAKER_04]: and scenarios.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the error bars are bigger for
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's harder for the climate modelers to
predict rainfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at the gray region,
it shows kind of the most likely scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you'll see is that for our
region, what's projected is, like the rest
[SPEAKER_04]: of the world, pretty substantial increases
in temperature, rainfall, annual rainfall
[SPEAKER_04]: possibly staying about roughly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what does that mean for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: It means increased drought, for those
reasons I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Longer growing season, farmers will be
moving to longer growing season varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Higher temperatures will increase crop
demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the need for irrigation, particularly
for high-value crops, will be dramatically
[SPEAKER_04]: increased.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even for things like our grain corn
that's so important to our dairy industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: could be challenging that more frequent
summer droughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the positive side, we're not living
in an area where rainfall is predicted to
[SPEAKER_04]: be dramatically decreasing, like in the
southwestern US, because that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: even, of course, much worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could look at this optimistically
or pessimistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: The optimistic view of this is we will
have water.
[SPEAKER_04]: The negative view is we still will have
more summer drought risk than farmers have
[SPEAKER_04]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not the kind of risk of things like
the Finger Lakes drying up or something
[SPEAKER_04]: dramatic like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, this longer growing season
thing is an opportunity for this region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opens up the palette to new types of crops
we might grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And already we see farmers exploring new
crops, new markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the observed increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the models all predict, of course,
this thing, this trend continuing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So already seeing a longer growing season
length.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are seeing already farmers exploring
longer growing season varieties to take
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, in fact, a positive feature.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we have to remember that the
frost free period is not all that
[SPEAKER_04]: determines the growing season length.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had, for example, corn farmers in
this state that are exploring longer
[SPEAKER_04]: growing season corn varieties,
because those are out in the field longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They produce more than the shorter growing
season varieties that they've historically
[SPEAKER_04]: used.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they have found is that in some
years, while we may have record breaking
[SPEAKER_04]: frost free periods, they can't get into
plant until late June because it's so darn
[SPEAKER_04]: wet out there they can't plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this just is one of the interesting way
to illustrate that climate change is not
[SPEAKER_04]: just about global warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's other issues as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're having a very substantial
observed increase in the frequency of high
[SPEAKER_04]: rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I'll talk about later, many farmers,
not only in the Northeast but in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Midwest as well, are beginning to explore
and actually putting investments into
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment to, when there are windows of
opportunity to get in the field,
[SPEAKER_04]: do more more quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bigger planters, bigger hay harvesting
equipment to get more acres done more
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers are making that kind of adaptation
because they feel that the windows are
[SPEAKER_04]: shrinking in terms of times when they can
get field access.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned, this is, again,
this is observed data.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not talking about percent increase
in total rainfall, but this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: increase in the frequency of days in a
year when we have very high rainfall
[SPEAKER_04]: events.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see this is a phenomenon
across the Northern Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to do with, in a warmer world,
there's more water vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: More of the world's water is up in the air
as water vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we warm our world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then if you have an upper atmosphere
condensation event that causes rain,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's more there to come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of the basic theoretical
reason for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it comes down is very hard to
predict.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see in the Northeast,
we're the real prize winner in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: 74% increase in these high rainfall
events.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another challenge for us in the Northeast,
you know, an advantage we've had compared
[SPEAKER_04]: to regions south of here is we've had less
pests and weed pressure because a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: things can't survive our cold winters.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, in a warming world,
warmer winters, many insects will benefit,
[SPEAKER_04]: able to overwinter, more generations per
season, northward expansion of range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are just the flea beetle,
a vector of Stuart's wilt, an important
[SPEAKER_04]: disease of corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And corn earworm, big problem with sweet
corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of these are insects that are
becoming earlier and becoming more of a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem in the Northeast with our warmer
winters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudzu, we modeled about 10 years ago,
we modeled that kudzu would likely be
[SPEAKER_04]: moving north from the south where it's
been a very terrible invasive weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, it is coming up here as our
winters get warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a new challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how will farmers respond to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably more pesticides, herbicides,
et cetera, needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something where we have to
think about, you know, the issues,
[SPEAKER_04]: the policy issues of protecting our
waterways, from increased chemical inputs,
[SPEAKER_04]: but allowing our farmers to adapt to
climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some new challenges there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I've certainly learned,
you know, being involved in this since the
[SPEAKER_04]: 1990s is we really have to expect the
unexpected.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the farmer groups that calls me out
more often than others to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: climate change is the fruit growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not about heat stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about more frost damage and freeze
damage that they anecdotally feel that
[SPEAKER_04]: they are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, we've had increased frequency
in the past several years of either
[SPEAKER_04]: midwinter freeze problems or premature
bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in 2012, most of you know,
apples bloomed a record-breaking four
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks earlier than normal, a long window
of frost threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, we lost millions of dollars
across the state in apple production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're currently working, we don't have
a lot of answers about this now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working, we have in my lab group a
apple bloom model and trying to look at
[SPEAKER_04]: that in relation to various climate change
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this really going to be part and parcel
of climate change or is this simply,
[SPEAKER_04]: these recent events, simply part of normal
weather variability?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the classic challenge of how do
we detect a real climate change signal
[SPEAKER_04]: against the background noise of real
weather variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the jury's still out on this one,
so we're still doing research on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's just a laundry list of,
you know, farm level adjustments.
[SPEAKER_04]: What farmers were actually beginning at
this point, I couldn't have said this 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago, but at this point I can say,
I can think of examples where farmers are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually doing some of the things on this
list right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might not all have even recognized
that these were climate change adaptation
[SPEAKER_04]: responses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them just, they're common sense
about good business and realizing they're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting hit over and over with certain
kinds of problems, making certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: investments.
[SPEAKER_04]: To deal with what they would call unusual
weather patterns, perhaps, rather than
[SPEAKER_04]: calling it climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly in the livestock dairy
industry, we see farmers thinking more
[SPEAKER_04]: carefully about if we're putting up a new
barn, making sure it has better cooling
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Milk production, cows like it really cool,
and milk production declines at even
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures in the mid-80s at high
humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of interest there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was recently this past summer in
July, I spoke at, and there was a very
[SPEAKER_04]: good conference here on dairy and climate
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were some farmers there and
quite a few people very interested in this
[SPEAKER_04]: topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the crop soil and water management
area, one of the big issues like all
[SPEAKER_04]: aspects of climate change really is
diversifying, kind of hedging your bets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of having one planting time,
having several planting times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully one staggered planting may do
well in a year, even when another planting
[SPEAKER_04]: date might be at a certain stage when
there's a certain kind of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_04]: mid-summer drought or something,
that it's vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or mixing it up with varieties and crops
and new crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one disadvantage to that, none of
these are really cost or risk free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the simplest strategy of
diversifying, of course if you have a year
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like the good old years and sort of
perfect for the crop you used to grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you've now diversified into a few
different crops to hedge your bets,
[SPEAKER_04]: well you might not make as much money as
if you had stayed with your old crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this diversifying thing does sometimes,
in a really quote, good year, farmers may
[SPEAKER_04]: make less money.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, they're buffered from
effects in bad years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned the weed disease and insect
pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really just need to stay on top of
tracking insect weed disease pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need IPM more than ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don mentioned my interest in soils and
Cornell Soil Health Program, and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: something I'm very involved with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a slide later talking about the
importance of soil health in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: buffering us from drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Irrigation and drainage systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this can be even the kind of thing
we're beginning to see some farmers do is
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of wrap these two together.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, having better drainage
systems to protect from floods,
[SPEAKER_04]: developing ditch systems on a farm to
quickly get water away from flood prone
[SPEAKER_04]: areas, but then moving that water into
small reservoirs so if a month later
[SPEAKER_04]: they've got a short term summer drought,
they've got some water there to irrigate
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Food crop frost protection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as I mentioned earlier,
larger scale farm equipment is something
[SPEAKER_04]: we didn't ourselves really think of a few
years ago, but we see farmers going for
[SPEAKER_04]: this as a way of covering more acreage
faster because they feel like they've got
[SPEAKER_04]: these shrinking windows for field access.
[SPEAKER_04]: That laundry list of things, as I
mentioned already, none of them are cost
[SPEAKER_04]: to risk free.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the problem for farmers is,
is it really time for me to think about
[SPEAKER_04]: doing something different?
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of those doing something
different things means some investment in
[SPEAKER_04]: labor, money, certain kinds of risks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is kind of where we're at at
Cornell and many other places trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: support farmer adaptation is providing
support services to farmers to help them
[SPEAKER_04]: make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the Cornell Institute for
Climate Change and Ag is very much focused
[SPEAKER_04]: on is new tools for farmers to help them,
give them the information to make wise
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps in some cases it may be wise to
wait a year or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other cases it may be they should have
made that change years ago and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely time to make the shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another trend we see happening in
terms of helping farmers cope with
[SPEAKER_04]: climate, but it's really not that much
focused on climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really what we call seasonal climate
forecasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in addition to trying to provide
farmers with simply better weather
[SPEAKER_04]: forecasts, you know, instead of five days
out, seven days, 12 days out, really
[SPEAKER_04]: provide better information that gives them
a better idea of what the whole season is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certain parts of the world where we
can really do this are parts of the world
[SPEAKER_04]: which are very sensitive to these El Nino,
La Nino cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately the northeast is not an area
that's particularly sensitive to those
[SPEAKER_04]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see with this map here,
this happens to be a map showing January
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at the historical record for
strong El Nino years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the white areas are areas where really
there's little change from normal,
[SPEAKER_04]: quote normal, in terms of rainfall in
January.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the green areas and blue areas are
areas where there's substantial increases
[SPEAKER_04]: in rainfall in El Nino years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see if you're a farmer in
Florida, or California, having information
[SPEAKER_04]: on whether it's an El Nino year gives you
very good information on upcoming
[SPEAKER_04]: potential rainfall forecast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is only as good as a historical
record.
[SPEAKER_04]: They simply do a relationship between
historical El Nino years and what happened
[SPEAKER_04]: in those years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent my last sabbatical leave at
University of Florida, and because that
[SPEAKER_04]: area is so sensitive to these El Nino
cycles, they have a, actually there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: really great website, the AgroClimate
website they have there for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put where your farm is,
and it gives you month to month
[SPEAKER_04]: information on all kinds of issues about
El Nino or La Nino years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you know what kind of year we're
having, like this year happens to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: very strong El Nino year, the farmer can
look and see month by month what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: deviations from normal temperature and
rainfall they might have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the challenge for the northeast is
actually coming up with something like El
[SPEAKER_04]: Nino, but El Nino doesn't work that well
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Toby Ault in our Earth Atmospheric
Sciences Department here at Cornell is
[SPEAKER_04]: working very hard at looking at other
things that might be clues to give our
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers seasonal forecasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it could be who knows what.
[SPEAKER_04]: A warmer summer in Calgary, Canada may
mean a wetter spring in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if it's a black box thing like
that, if it has high probabilities,
[SPEAKER_04]: it could be useful to our farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Universities are all about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers are getting on top of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And industry is also seeing the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was out in San Francisco for the
American Geophysical Union Conference a
[SPEAKER_04]: few years ago, visited this new company.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was kind of mostly a lot of guys
from Google, men and women from Google,
[SPEAKER_04]: really just good with analyzing data,
satellite data and everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: developed this thing called the Climate
Corporation to give farmers everything
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've got to bear these days with
what's happening with climate,
[SPEAKER_04]: satellite data, bring it all to bear on
their farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Giving them information to guide their
farm practices, focused pretty much on the
[SPEAKER_04]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was there two or three years ago,
it was a really cool office, typical
[SPEAKER_04]: Google office.
[SPEAKER_04]: No walls between the offices, all these
young people, really very exciting place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hadn't yet made any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Monsanto bought them out for a billion
dollars last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing we worry about are financial
barriers, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all farmers have access to some of
these new tools, equity issues,
[SPEAKER_04]: have the capital, strategic information to
adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a whole social science issue
that kind of goes along with our climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change story and work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a lot of social scientists at
Cornell getting very engaged with us on
[SPEAKER_04]: this issue and also internationally as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just in Malawi working with Rachel
Besner Kerr in the development sociology
[SPEAKER_04]: department here and working with farmers
there on climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of issues for those small
landholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the global issue, we also,
of course, have equity issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm focusing a lot on crop production for
the audience today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, there's whole issues with
distribution, waste management,
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of big issues there to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in my last few slides, I want to talk a
little bit about the other side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: coin, which is not simply coping with
climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers learning to deal with sort of some
inevitable changes in the weather patterns
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, what can they do to improve
energy efficiency at the same time improve
[SPEAKER_04]: their bottom line?
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, farmers are all about this
in many ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, farmers went to diesel engines
decades ago before climate change was a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because of climate change or because
of the goodness of their heart,
[SPEAKER_04]: they felt like improving energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so farmers are really excited about
renewable energy opportunities on the farm
[SPEAKER_04]: and very open to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biofuel crops, it's a big, complicated,
controversial issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes a lot of sense from the
standpoint of instead of bringing new
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon from fossil fuels buried deep in
the earth up to our climate system and
[SPEAKER_04]: having to deal with that carbon for a long
time to come, recycling carbon through
[SPEAKER_04]: biofuel crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, of course, it makes a big
difference how you grow that crop if you
[SPEAKER_04]: use a lot of fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: To grow the crop, you kind of spoiled the
advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using food crops, you could
compete for food prices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then where you grow it to if you're
competing with prime agricultural land,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's issues like that to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from a simply theoretical standpoint,
there is some good sense behind the
[SPEAKER_04]: biofuel crop thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recoupling animal and crop production
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you see when you see
that picture, but I see nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon, and energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the farm video you're going to see
today is about adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at our climate change website,
we have a similar farmer video talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about mitigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there you'll hear a number of dairy
farmers talking about anaerobic digesters
[SPEAKER_04]: to deal with manure waste and get free
energy for the farm and also deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: odor problems on the farm and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It surprises some people to learn that
when you look at the developed world,
[SPEAKER_04]: a place like the United States in
particular, and if you do things on a CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: equivalent basis, the big problem on our
farms in terms of the big contributor of
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture to climate change in a place
like the US is not CO2 emissions from
[SPEAKER_04]: tractor driving, but nitrous oxide
emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because nitrous oxide is 300 times
more potent on a molecule per molecule
[SPEAKER_04]: basis than CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's released in trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 1% of the nitrogen fertilizer put
onto land goes up into the air as nitrous
[SPEAKER_04]: oxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're using manures or organic
sources of nitrogen, this is the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you're using manures or
organic sources, you do reduce your carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: footprint because you're not paying for
the embedded carbon footprint of the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, even manures or organic sources
release nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a key to this story for the developed
world and farming is better nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here at Cornell, we have this ADAPT-N
tool many of you may have heard about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Harold Van Ness has been quite involved
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been involved with it in some ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weather-based precision nitrogen
management tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been very successful with corn farmers,
and we're beginning to look into expanding
[SPEAKER_04]: it to other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uses real-time weather to figure out what
the nitrogen mineralization rate is so
[SPEAKER_04]: that farmers can account for basically the
free nitrogen due to microbial activity in
[SPEAKER_04]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's now been commercialized,
available in 26 states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned soil health.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at this as both the building soil
organic matter is something we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to farmers about for many years
for crop productivity, but it's both an
[SPEAKER_04]: adaptation to climate change in terms of
an increasing resilience to drought and
[SPEAKER_04]: flooding.
[SPEAKER_04]: High organic matter means better water
holding capacity and drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also carbon in the soil that
otherwise would be in the air as CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in developing countries, when we talk
about medication, it's not about nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't use a lot of nitrogen
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it has to do with moving plot to
plot, quickly depleting soil resources,
[SPEAKER_04]: and doing a lot of slash and burn
agriculture, deforestation to feed a
[SPEAKER_04]: growing population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a significant part of global CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: So CO2 emissions are associated with
deforestation, and a lot of that
[SPEAKER_04]: deforestation is associated with
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the developing world, a lot of the
emphasis is really on improving,
[SPEAKER_04]: maintaining high quality soils so this
process can be slowed and maximizing
[SPEAKER_04]: production from land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mention of one project I'm involved
with in Zambia.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a paper in Proceeding National
Academy of Sciences that goes into
[SPEAKER_04]: details.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a co-op of actually about 20,000
small landholder farmers, very poor
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some years ago, they got involved in
working together on developing soil
[SPEAKER_04]: building processes to help their
productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've also been working with them on
entering carbon markets to get credit for
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have been growing these.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tree down there in the middle in the
center is a Faderbia albita tree,
[SPEAKER_04]: a nitrogen fixing tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: They planted 700,000 of those,
intercropping those in their land area for
[SPEAKER_04]: getting basically nitrogen for their
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those trees also store carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of a win-win scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done a great job of marketing
their products.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a website called itswild.org if
you want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they market their own peanut butter,
for example, and really doing cool things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this gets into what we eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so deciding to buy from a place like
that is a consumer choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to mention, since I did
mention food systems, that we all of us as
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers affect farmer choices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sustainability and carbon
footprint of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can think more about what we're
eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more slides, then I'll show
the farmer video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to kind of put these things
together and say that sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: development, sustainable ag development,
and climate change are linked in many
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of two big ways, both on the
mitigation end and the adaptation end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using sustainable farming practices can
help reduce greenhouse gases, sequester
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon, and it buffers the farmer from
climate change in terms of, I mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier, drought and flooding,
water holding capacity, and drainage of
[SPEAKER_04]: soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I've talked to farmers, almost no
matter where I've been in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is some common ground and some
places to enter the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, in this country, not so much in
other places I go to, but in this country,
[SPEAKER_04]: as we all know, the climate change issues
become very politicized.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've never met a farmer here or
anywhere that is not concerned about
[SPEAKER_04]: extreme weather events and uncertainty
about the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the way we begin the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every farmer is concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you'll see in our farmer video,
we'll show you in a second, some of them
[SPEAKER_04]: are a little reticent to use the phrase
climate change, but they're all concerned
[SPEAKER_04]: about those issues and doing things to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers have the same problem we all do,
including climate scientists, detecting a
[SPEAKER_04]: real climate change trend that they should
invest in against the noise of weather
[SPEAKER_04]: variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's part of the job of climate
scientists at a place like Cornell to help
[SPEAKER_04]: them figure that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the mitigation end,
farmers are all concerned about energy
[SPEAKER_04]: costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all interested in future energy
renewables and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they're also very concerned about
climate change policies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something where we have to
consider where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many farmers are more afraid of the policy
reaction to climate change than climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think of things like carbon taxes
affecting their transportation costs,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to keep all of that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I want to turn it over to
the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we can get this going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just click on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's a little bit of me doing a
little bit of intro to this, but you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: see here from a few different farmers
talking about adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll have some time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should take about 12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weather is definitely becoming more
erratic and more extreme than what it had
[SPEAKER_06]: been in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have that tendency, as others do,
that have lived a long time in the same
[SPEAKER_07]: place to say, well, the winters aren't as
cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not getting as much snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it's been a surprise over the
last few years how much earlier the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons have become in general.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would say that it actually does seem
like the season gets hotter faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here at one of Cornell's apple
orchard research sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: New York is well known for the quality of
its apples.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're usually second or third in the US in
apple production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got there by farmers for over many
years, really working with Cornell
[SPEAKER_04]: researchers to come up with best
management practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, now we're facing,
like farmers everywhere, new challenges,
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges associated with climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I never expected when I got
into this climate change research realm
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the 1990s that one of the most
important things that would come up with
[SPEAKER_04]: regards to the fruit crop growers is
actually cold and frost damage in a
[SPEAKER_04]: warming world.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason for that is that these plants
can sometimes be tricked into blooming
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier with a warming winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had known from looking at
historical records that the apples were
[SPEAKER_04]: blooming a few days earlier than they used
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in 2012, there was a real record
breaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: The apples in the state bloom about four
weeks earlier than normal, never observed
[SPEAKER_04]: before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this put them into a really
long period of frost risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, we lost close to half the
crop in much of the state, millions of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars of damage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to deal with this sort of thing,
we have to think about things like frost
[SPEAKER_04]: risk warning systems for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers may have to consider misting
systems or wind machines for frost
[SPEAKER_04]: protection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our apple breeders may have to think
about coming up with genetic types that
[SPEAKER_04]: don't jump the gun in terms of early bloom
in warm winters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the experience of adapting to climate
change may be different for each farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nevertheless, many of the state's
leading agricultural industries,
[SPEAKER_04]: which include dairy, grapes, apples and
fresh market produce, all face new
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges, new risks and new
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to climate change and
adaptation, farmers across New York all
[SPEAKER_04]: have a story to tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Dale Stein, senior partner in Stein
Farms in Leroy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We milk 850 cows, work almost 3,000 acres
of land.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we've had very heavy rain all
morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got flood watches up all over.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen years where a drought where on
the gravel ground, you get almost no
[SPEAKER_06]: yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually had two years in a row,
2011 and 2012 were too dry here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all our forages were lower production.
[SPEAKER_06]: We feed 75 ton of feed a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So about four tractor trailer loads of
feed a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We ended up by the end of 2012 running out
of our surplus forage.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd used all that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We end up on those years buying more
grain, which increases our cost of
[SPEAKER_06]: production and lowers your profit down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're harvesting 1,500 to 2,000 ton of
triticale every May that if I didn't have
[SPEAKER_06]: that's extra on the same ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I didn't have that, we would have been
in a lot worse place than we were without
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The forage inventory shortages that we've
had from extreme weather conditions in
[SPEAKER_05]: recent years is really just a sign of
things to come, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmers have to deal with a change in
climate each and every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in extension, we really try to help
farmers manage their risk and growing a
[SPEAKER_05]: triticale forage crop or another small
grain for forage can really give another
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to protect their resources
over the winter because they're more
[SPEAKER_05]: vulnerable to extreme precipitation events
and losing that soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can protect the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Notice the fibers root system.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why this crop can hold soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just see how much soil even in this
couple inches of roots that this is
[SPEAKER_05]: holding onto.
[SPEAKER_06]: My standpoint from what I've seen on this
farm, triticale works very well for us and
[SPEAKER_06]: the palatability is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cows love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an awesome combination of a
profitable crop that protects the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baffles me why more farmers aren't using
more triticale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just baffles me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Paul King.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do most of the vineyard management and
most of the winemaking and all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: distilling here at Six Mile Creek
Vineyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been here for almost 25 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: A longer growing season and a little
hotter weather will ripen the fruit more
[SPEAKER_07]: dependably.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some varieties and I can give
you two or three examples.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinot Noir is a little futsy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Merlot for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cabernet Sauvignon and to a lesser degree
Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think these are varieties that will will
benefit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The best management option for any
individual vineyard to deal with
[SPEAKER_07]: increasingly varying weather if we talk
about climate change would be to think
[SPEAKER_07]: carefully about the varieties that they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really the biggest management
strategy because everything else you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing is then a little bit of sort of a
stopgap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wind turbines help in only very specific
weather conditions where very calm
[SPEAKER_07]: conditions are set up and there's a deep
gradient between the temperatures at the
[SPEAKER_07]: surface and just a few hundred feet in the
air and mixing up that layer can help a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot but they're pretty specific weather
conditions and it's a pretty costly
[SPEAKER_07]: investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to grow the varieties that you
can grow well and that's what you need to
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is especially true at Six Mile Creek
but it's also true for any of the other
[SPEAKER_07]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last winter was a particularly cold one
and it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the minimum low temperature in
Ithaca is still probably minus 23 degrees
[SPEAKER_07]: Fahrenheit or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't really approach that but what we
did see here were lots of excursions to
[SPEAKER_07]: minus 14 minus 15 minus 16 degrees and
that is a very very critical temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get significant bud loss
right around that threshold.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that going to have on the quality
and quantity of wine grapes that are grown
[SPEAKER_07]: in the region and certainly at Six Mile
Creek Vineyard we have lost most of the
[SPEAKER_07]: reasoning fruit that we had here as
compared with our Save All, a hybrid,
[SPEAKER_07]: where we have virtually a full crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a lack of name recognition of
some of these hybrids Save All Blanc.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds a lot like Sauvignon Blanc but
is that a Sauvignon Blanc?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well it's not a Sauvignon Blanc.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a completely different variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get six ton per acre even here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's disease resistant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the first grape varieties to
ripen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful grape variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just relatively unknown but I think
the people that I know that most enjoy
[SPEAKER_07]: wine really like trying new wines so
there's a huge huge outlet out there for
[SPEAKER_07]: exploring some of the new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the Finger Lake Sportes in the
long run that's going to serve to help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rod Farrow, one of the owners and
operators of Lamont Fruit Farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Waterport, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We operate about 500 acres of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow all kinds of varieties,
about 29 different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major varieties would be Empire,
Honeycrisp, Gala, Fugees, Sweet Tangos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've certainly moved our bloom time
forward probably at least five to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: days and in some years a lot more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of this we can attribute to
climate change is still a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: debatable to me personally but there's
certainly a sense that things are changing
[SPEAKER_00]: here and that the climate is getting a
little more unpredictable and the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: early season and early bloom seems to be
greater and greater every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances of a warm spell in March,
an extended warm spell, seem to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger now than they were 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say in general our farm's
definitely vulnerable to extreme weather
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the mercy of Mother Nature no
matter what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is has the frequency
increased and the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly say they've been a lot of
extreme instances of weather over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 plus years here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a number of very large hail
storms but certainly the frequency of that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been greater since 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that drives what you do
in terms of risk management is the
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability of your business and a
profitable business can afford to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things to mitigate risk whether that be
invest in frost machines or try to choose
[SPEAKER_00]: better orchard size or add overhead
cooling or overhead irrigation frost
[SPEAKER_00]: protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the 2000s the orchard business has
generally been pretty healthy so I
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly see an uptick in investment in
risk management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere we have reasonable sites or good
orchard sites we've survived any frost
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've ever had including 2012 and we
look at it as a company strategy that
[SPEAKER_00]: investing in the highest possible fruit
sites or orchard sites has just as big or
[SPEAKER_00]: if not greater economic impact than trying
to mitigate a site that's going to be at
[SPEAKER_00]: risk in years when it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly multi-parallel insurance can
help in years of distinct disaster and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make years that could be very
very bad for you actually years that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could not necessarily thrive in but you
can at least survive through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're big believers in that the
strategies that are being used at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment to lower your risk are definitely
trying to try to preserve the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: viability of fruit farms and businesses in
general in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all climate change is negative so
increasing the number of heat units per
[SPEAKER_00]: season has a positive impact on what we
can do for fruit size potentially yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and return bloom tree health so there's
always gains and balances with any thing
[SPEAKER_00]: we certainly have a little bit higher risk
but we also possibly have a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher potential in terms of yield and
value.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Jessica Clark I'm the assistant
farm manager at the Poughkeepsie Farm
[SPEAKER_08]: Project and the Poughkeepsie Farm Project
is a non-profit that has an educational
[SPEAKER_08]: mission and also a working CSA farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not certified organic but we do try
to use organic practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: Notice climate change in terms of the
disease susceptibility of our plants and
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen definitely an increase in the
number of different diseases and pests
[SPEAKER_08]: that can affect us here in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly when we have very extreme
weather events and certainly when we have
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of these very strange you know very
either early summers or very late summers
[SPEAKER_08]: or very very late fall so that it doesn't
actually get to freezing until February
[SPEAKER_08]: you know I'm sure that that extends how
far strong the disease pressure can be the
[SPEAKER_08]: next year in the pest pressure and heat
stress actually can be a big factor for a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of our brassicas and in general that's
something you deal with as a farmer and
[SPEAKER_08]: the changing of the seasons spring to
summer brassicas are always going to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: challenge but they're even more of a
challenge and they're a good indicator in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of crops because they do not like a
lot of variability in their weather they
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty much like the weather to always be
you know relatively mild not too wet not
[SPEAKER_08]: too dry and pretty much the same
temperature all the time and that's really
[SPEAKER_08]: just not what you get here so we're we're
already dealing with a change in climate
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what was it two years ago when we
would have 80 degree weather in early
[SPEAKER_08]: March and then go freezing in April crazy
things can happen in the season it's
[SPEAKER_08]: almost like predicting for
unpredictability having that kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: reinforces the fact that we you know
should have diversified market areas and
[SPEAKER_08]: also diversified crops you don't have to
be as diversified as the CSA because
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly that can be a little bit
overboard in some areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly to rely on one crop is you
know it's like playing a game of dice like
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes it's just not going to come up
your turn and if certainly if you don't
[SPEAKER_08]: have crop insurance and and even if you do
have crop insurance you know it can be a
[SPEAKER_08]: very risky you know game to play.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people who are in the orchard
business in Ulster County and even they're
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of going more into agro tourism
they're going more into different crops
[SPEAKER_08]: different specialty crops just to have
something on the side that they can rely
[SPEAKER_08]: on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it kind of makes one as a farmer
more bold to say like oh well we'll just
[SPEAKER_08]: see how early we can get tomatoes if it's
going to be warmer earlier or we'll see
[SPEAKER_08]: how late we can have crops you know into
the fall if it doesn't work it doesn't
[SPEAKER_08]: work but you never know and probably
something else is going to fail in the
[SPEAKER_08]: meantime.
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally like to also make sure that
our organic matter is high in our soils to
[SPEAKER_08]: begin with so that it has that humus and
organic matter that's capable of holding
[SPEAKER_08]: water as well as as much as possible
keeping our soil covered in a cover crop
[SPEAKER_08]: when we can and then even when we're
tilling in that cover crop to try and
[SPEAKER_08]: choose moments where we're not losing too
much soil certainly we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_08]: carbon sequestration and being able to
lock in a lot of that carbon into our
[SPEAKER_08]: soils partially because it's good for the
earth and partially because it's good for
[SPEAKER_08]: our plants to have that much you know to
have a high carbon soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you come into the idea of
sustainable farming knowing that you're
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to not you know ruin the planet and
trying to you know make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_08]: not you know you're not messing things up
too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well these are just some of the
experiences and challenges that farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the northeast are dealing with
and adapting to climate change but we have
[SPEAKER_04]: advantages in this region too such as
being relatively water rich and with a
[SPEAKER_04]: longer growing season this could open up
new opportunities for new markets and new
[SPEAKER_04]: crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here at Cornell and Cornell Institute of
Climate Change and Agriculture we are
[SPEAKER_04]: poised and ready to take on climate change
challenges and work with our grower
[SPEAKER_04]: partners stay one step ahead of the curve
and take advantage of any opportunities
[SPEAKER_04]: that might come our way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'm pretty soon the farmers will
be able to do my whole talk and I won't
[SPEAKER_04]: even need me up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: First I would just like to thank Dave for
a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned that we in the northeast are
relatively water rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously California is dealing with a
very different set of circumstances.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read a number of pieces about
municipalities in California looking to
[SPEAKER_03]: the ocean and desalination projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that that's going to be a
viable option for agriculture going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward in coastal states?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't follow that literature really
carefully only enough to know that in
[SPEAKER_04]: places like Israel and other places
they've been working on that for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time and that this growing drought stress
in a lot of parts of the world is
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing the pressure to move on that
technology and it's getting better,
[SPEAKER_04]: getting more feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: My initial reaction is probably the first
place that water will go is for drinking
[SPEAKER_04]: water for humans because agriculture needs
so much water and the cost is high.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Israel they're using it for drip
irrigation of vegetable crops because you
[SPEAKER_04]: can minimize the amount of water needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an area of technology
that's moving forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of these things like so many
things about climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we keep pace with the pace of climate
change that's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I could just add to that,
San Diego was installed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: desalination plants costing $1 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will provide 7% of the water they need
for the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear that San Diego is investing $1
billion in desalination.
[SPEAKER_04]: That points out how we're beginning to see
the cost of adaptation which then puts
[SPEAKER_04]: into context the cost of doing something
to mitigate so we don't have to do more
[SPEAKER_04]: and more of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be the cost to taxpayers in the
future as we continue to just cope with
[SPEAKER_04]: climate change as opposed to the supposed
risks of slowing pace of climate change
[SPEAKER_03]: and energy policies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you think of any specific field level
adaptations that you've seen people
[SPEAKER_09]: experimenting with, not just
diversification but changes in the ways
[SPEAKER_09]: that they manage their fields that maybe
aren't just so well in use already that
[SPEAKER_09]: they showed up in the video?
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of new ideas, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the things that were in my list
which is more attention, more recognition
[SPEAKER_04]: that the whole soil health thing we've
been talking about for some time is also
[SPEAKER_04]: relevant to climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing about farmers kind of took me a
little by surprise noticing farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: investing in this big equipment to do
things more quickly on larger acreages
[SPEAKER_04]: because they felt the windows were
shrinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really think of anything else in
particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have something in particular to
find?
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers are constantly innovative and the
puppy, like I said, the big equipment
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff is something that surprised me with
things we hadn't thought of so I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know what's next.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had one of our organic farmer advisors
from an old project who started ridging
[SPEAKER_09]: his spring crops to keep them out of the
floods here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Floods he was getting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then mulching it to try to keep,
after the rain stopped, to try to keep the
[SPEAKER_09]: moisture in over the droughty summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so ridging will keep your roots out
of the wet soil and help the drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, then you do need to,
if it gets dry, they'll get drier faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any reactions to the farmers?
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried to include in that obviously a
range of farmers from kind of big scale
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial to small scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of felt like they all were
surprisingly realistic and optimistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the majority of farmers willing to
change their practices even though they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need to yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they willing to do that in a way to
prevent more carbon emissions if they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get any benefit from that any
immediate benefit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the question is are farmers willing
to change their practices if they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: get any immediate benefit?
[SPEAKER_04]: My gut reaction is no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're all about sending their
kids to college, feeding their families
[SPEAKER_04]: and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to take a family vacation in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's going to affect those things,
they're not likely to do it for the good
[SPEAKER_04]: of society.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't feel like they're responsible
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, I think, you know,
I've got my slide that's kind of climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change preparedness makes good business
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all kinds of things about being
one step ahead of your competitors.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had people even from big
international companies like PepsiCo and
[SPEAKER_04]: these are, you know, liberals groups
coming to talk to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're all about tell us what climate
change is going to mean in different parts
[SPEAKER_04]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to stay one step ahead of our
competitors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we need to do to be a
successful company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So farmers are very, you know,
it would take some risk to be one step
[SPEAKER_04]: ahead of the competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a farmer, for example, might start
investing thinking more about the cell
[SPEAKER_04]: health thing he's been hearing about for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he hears a neighbor say, you know,
last year was super wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you couldn't get into your
field, but I got into my field,
[SPEAKER_04]: the harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they might start thinking about those
kind of things a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to go too far out in the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, I'd like to thank Dave for a
great presentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
