[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about how AI
facilitates the scientific discovery from
[SPEAKER_00]: big data and process-based modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably, as you may be aware,
AI is a big area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, so many different methods
and so powerful in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I just want to share the
experience my lab had and using AI in our
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about why we
developed a product, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as an AI modeling tool,
and how we use the product to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanisms underlying soil carbon
storage and to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: climatological temperature sensitivity for
soil organic carbon along soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my lab is developing a so-called BIM,
Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network,
[SPEAKER_00]: as another AI modeling tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in each of the slides, I have a bottom
to indicate the different part of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably most of us has been
influenced so much by, like, chart-GTP
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding AI, AI method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chart-GTP basically uses so-called
foundation models, which are pre-trained
[SPEAKER_00]: with massive data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when user to make a question or
make a request, to a chart-GTP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the chart-GTP will use the new
data sets, relevant data sets to that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular questions to do fine-tuning
before they make, you know, answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chart-GTP, while there are many of
those so-called large language models
[SPEAKER_00]: available, those large language models
require lots of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use it, most of the time we use
that as a black box model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these kind of AI tools can
generate the results that may not
[SPEAKER_00]: physically or biologically consistent with
our understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AI tools without clear, mechanistic
understanding may not effectively help us
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but, you know, last year,
two Nobel prizes awarded to physics and in
[SPEAKER_00]: physics and chemistry to the scientists to
make a great contribution to advances in
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and the physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially like the award in
chemistry, they certainly can use the AI
[SPEAKER_00]: for advanced science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, and particularly the,
you know, Professor John Hopfield recently
[SPEAKER_00]: made a note that basically he think that
word is understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that you should be able to
take anything apart, understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between its constituents,
do experiments, on that basis to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop a quantitative understanding of
its behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so how to use the AI as a
scientific tool is a major issues we have
[SPEAKER_00]: been thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to introduce an AI tool
my lab has developed, so-called Pruda.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically combine process based
modeling, and the neural network,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also data assimilation approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process based model is used a lot of
understanding about the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the machine learning most of the time
used as a tool for data mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Pruda, the tool we have
developed is try to combine the best out
[SPEAKER_00]: there for that ability capability for data
mining through machine learning and the
[SPEAKER_00]: process based understandings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I discuss why we developed this
approach Pruda as a tool to understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to understand the soil carbon
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably as many of you know, the soil is
so critical for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now also so critical for carbon
sequestration towards the so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: climate smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to predict the soil carbon dynamic
and the storage is a major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this figure on the y-axis is a
model predict the soil carbon density from
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 models that was used in the IPCC fifth
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And x-axis is observation based soil
carbon density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see from this figure that if
the model can predict the soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: density well enough, then most of those
dots are supposed to be scattered around
[SPEAKER_00]: the one to one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see from this figure the model
basically has no idea what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: These uncertainty model earth system
modeling actually propagates to those
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction regarding the land carbon sink
and the climate dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the three major sources
that cause that uncertainty in future
[SPEAKER_00]: climate prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab has been try to understand and
try to improve how we can predict the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dynamic well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to predict the soil carbon or
anything, if we want to make more
[SPEAKER_00]: realistic prediction, we need a perfect
model structure perfect the model
[SPEAKER_00]: parameterization and also forcing
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab has examined all those three
elements and one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we developed a framework to unify
all the land carbon cycle and nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: fast form models use a matrix equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as those model uses so-called pool
and fluxes structure so we can unify all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we studied the bunch of
models to try to understand what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental principles underline them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we discovered that no matter what
kind of model structure, as long as they
[SPEAKER_00]: use the so-called pool and the fluxes of
schemes and all the model can be
[SPEAKER_00]: represented by these matrix equations that
accounts carbon input into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a carbon dynamic,
basically carbon transformation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and also including release from the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this is a matrix equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have converted about 40 models into
matrix form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another group from Mach Planck
Institute in Germany they also converted
[SPEAKER_00]: about the 20 non-linear microbial model
into this matrix form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have that once we have the
unified framework, we can study models at
[SPEAKER_00]: a different level of a complexity on the
one overarching theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the NCAR National Center for
Atmospheric Risk Research, they developed
[SPEAKER_00]: the so-called community land model with
carbon-nitrogen dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably literally is one of the
most complicated model in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used about nearly 1000 pools to
describe carbon-nitrogen dynamics and the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of six modules to describe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my lab have converted into two
equations for carbon and nitrogen cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: in vegetation and the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we converted to two equations,
these structures become highly modular and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make a much more powerful
diagnostic capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make the spin up much faster,
faster by about 50 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we converted to the unified
framework, now we can pinpoint the sources
[SPEAKER_00]: of model uncertainties.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these particular studies, we study,
we use the eight models and ranging from
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 model with two pool versus awkwardly
model from France, that's with 101 the
[SPEAKER_00]: pools, no matter how complicated or the
complexity we can all represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: different models in one unified frame,
basically model structure is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we represented all those models,
all the model in the same framework,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we did an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used these eight models and feed the
same forcing and all the models also GPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find out that actually more
under them, among the models that the
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainties diverges as time goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, since now we have unified
framework, now we can standardize the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary of eight models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can shrink these model
uncertainties to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those study, that means these simulation
modeling approach that has been used by
[SPEAKER_00]: community for 60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the simulation modeling approach,
basically we develop the model by given
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we assign the model as a
parameter value and use the metadata to
[SPEAKER_00]: drive, to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those simulation modeling does not use
much data to improve model parameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: parameterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's lead to the divergency model
predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next step, we, we use the so-called the
data assimilation, try to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: model parameterization will influence the
model dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, many people use the digital twin to
describe these data assimilation approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically try to use the model mimic the
real world as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data assimilation, the idea is we are
not only need the model structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also use the relevant observations
through data assimilation to estimate the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter, make the model to predict the
real world phenomena as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically, that's why the
digital twin came from, your prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab has been doing this since about 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first post I hired to do this is 2003
to 2005 at the regional scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past about 20, I mean,
especially first 15 years, we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of analysis using these digital
twin types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly we improved this model
prediction very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the lot, the residue decreased,
the spatial representation of a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon improved, but still the accuracy is
not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accuracy can, you know, improve the
tool that like about R square of a point
[SPEAKER_00]: of four, but still no matter what we do,
still we not cannot improve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we analyze, we thinking about this
issue, why, you know, once we use the
[SPEAKER_00]: data, the digital twin still cannot
perform well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to understand the reason,
basically the parameter value in those
[SPEAKER_00]: models, in those earth system model at the
global scale assumed to be constant over
[SPEAKER_00]: space and the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, but actually these assumption may
be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These assumption works for model to be
used at the local scale for short term,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we do the long term and the
largest scale simulation, it may not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically parameter in the models is a
representative property for those
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, the soil property and the
microbial dynamic in Ithaca, in the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's assumed the same as in Africa or
South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, you know, biologically or
ecologically, it doesn't make sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the currently models still make those
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we realize that, and we propose
that we really need spatially and a
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary varying parameter in order to
make the digital twin works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we incorporate the deep
learning into our scheme to develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: we develop the so-called process guided
deep learning and the data driven
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically at the data assimilation
approach, we add the deep learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can see we used about 60,000
vertical profile for soil carbon worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: and put into this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get the R-square 0.62.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these R-square accuracy is very close,
very similar to those machine learning
[SPEAKER_00]: without any process, basically so-called
soil mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: People use a soil mapping that may use the
neural network without any process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is accuracy, it's almost reached
the level that we, so far we cannot do
[SPEAKER_00]: much at the, at least at the global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now hopefully now I introduce,
basically discuss the why we use this
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing the AI modeling tools to do,
to combine the process understanding and
[SPEAKER_00]: the data mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first the issue we try to adjust the
use of these method is the so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial to evaluate microbial rule in
soil carbon, organic carbon formation and
[SPEAKER_00]: the persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recently the soil scientists and
led by Michael Schmidt and Johannes also
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new framework emphasize the rule of
microbe and the mineral in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic formation and persistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still need to find a way to
evaluate the relative importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: various process in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular study, we first
defined the so-called microbial carbon use
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency as biomass, microbial biomass
produced divided by substrate uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these actually microbial carbon use
efficiency has represented dual rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one point is microbe consume the soil
organic substrate for to get the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the soil microbe also contribute
to soil organic substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the relative rule, relative importance
of those two rules and might determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic carbon formation and the
persistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one hypothesis in the floating in the
literature is that the higher microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon use efficiency will lead to the
accrual of a soil organic carbon storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the microbial carbon use
efficiency stimulate microbial biomass and
[SPEAKER_00]: the necromancy formation and then
contribute the soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the other ideas has been greatly
discussed in the literature that if
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial carbon use efficiency increased
and the microbial biomass increased and
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to more extracellular enzyme
activities, actually soil organic carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: can decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as mentioned in our product,
we have model structures that represent
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbial activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can test, see under what kind of
conditions the soil organic carbon will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase versus decrease with the
microbial carbon use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out two critical parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a resonance time for microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is a resonance time for enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those different parameters will
lead to that different patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the issue is what the real world,
the observation will tell us about those
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the basically under the,
if we can use the real world data to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us, then we can evaluate the relative
importance of for those process
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is use the, as I mentioned
that we use the 60,000 vertical soil
[SPEAKER_00]: profile data and to constrain the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we estimate each of the seven
components that contribute to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic carbon storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make that evaluation to see
that their relative importance use two
[SPEAKER_00]: type of sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one type of the sensitivity is
so-called spatially same constant
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter versus the variance parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier that currently
earth system model all use the constant
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter over the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we estimate the spatially variance
parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we use the spatially constant
parameter versus the variance parameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that microbial carbon use
efficiency has the largest impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did the sensitivity analysis,
which has been done regularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling or also indicate the microbial
carbon use efficiency is most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also use the model generated the
relationship of a soil organic carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the microbial carbon use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also observation use the matter
analysis to basically to verify the model
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically one of the study we
have done to use these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: AI facilitate the AI modeling tools to
understand the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we also use these tool for
another study, try to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another study we call the
climatological temperature sensitivity for
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic carbon to warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we first again use these
global database of vertical soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use a different layer of a
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use each of the two centimeter as a
soil layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get the data from this
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use these, at each thin layer,
we have soil organic carbon versus
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the temperature sensitivity,
sorry, temperature sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use those along the different
layer, we got the observed apparent
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensitivity 210 versus depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this indicate that temperature
sensitivity for soil organic carbon at the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface is highest, most sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then towards the deep layer,
the sensitivity is very, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically observation based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now these observation based gradients
for temperature sensitivity could cost by
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of mechanisms and very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now how can we know which mechanism
really influence them?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the real world, it's very difficult to
do experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly we need the innovation,
innovative approach to do experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we have modeling, we will see
whether we can use model AI modeling to
[SPEAKER_00]: help teaser that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is observation, observe the part
apparent temperature function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the microbial based model,
non-linear model after use the data
[SPEAKER_00]: simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we cannot reproduce that
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the CLM model and before
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pattern also doesn't reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after we use the product to train the
CLM, and then we find that the pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can use model as digital twin to
represent observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we need to make sure that
actually the model, the parameter for
[SPEAKER_00]: intrinsic temperature sensitivity actually
relatively constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this apparent one has a huge depth
dependency, but the intrinsic one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more or less constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a huge contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a digital twin to the real
world pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can use this digital twin to
understand what causes these apparent
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that's different from the model
intrinsic temperature sensitivity use this
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned that we use this matrix
equation to unify all the land carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle models, as long as they use the so
called pull and flex structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these equations, there are seven
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are six terms, but represent
seven processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can tease them apart, use the
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did, the first thing we did we
used to manipulate A parameter matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: A.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is basically a transformation matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another is K, K is decomposability
matrix vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make the globally uniformed A
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can see that once we use the
globally uniformed matrix, we unify the A.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the apparent sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the intrinsic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we manipulate the A matrix and then we
lift the Q10 vertical profile closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the intrinsic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we unify the K separately,
also make it closer to the intrinsic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we unify both A and K,
actually this is very close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: intrinsic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on this, we can see that probably
those processes related to microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon transformation and the absorption
and also related to organic carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposability play the huge role to
influence the temperature sensitivity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also manipulate other parameters
like water scalar and the depth scalar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have effect, but they cannot match
the intrinsic one well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, if we unify all these parameters,
actually the theoretically we can see this
[SPEAKER_00]: even temperature sensitivity could
increase with the depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is opposite from the observed
apparent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can use a digital train to try to
see what the potential mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: underline those observed pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the challenge is still how to get
empirical evidence to support those AI
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now currently our lab is developing
so-called Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural
[SPEAKER_00]: Network by a graduate student,
Hao Di.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a second year graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after he joined our lab,
now he put the matrix equation into neural
[SPEAKER_00]: network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find out the accuracy is very
high, even slightly higher than the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, computationally much faster than
product by 50 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, our matrix equations
spin up already faster than the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: model by 50 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is another 50 times over that 50
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically now being make the spin up
faster by 2000, more than 2000 times
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than the current lab model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this offer the explanatory power and we
try to do the transfer learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to use this technique for the carbon
farming at the farm level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me make a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2017, we identified the issue that's
need to be solved by AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: We luckily enough recruit a graduate
student who developed a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used the product to study the
microbial carbon use efficiency and the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic carbon relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also used this to study the
modeling convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another graduate student studied
Intrinsic versus ApprentiQ10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Hao Di is developing the BIM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently we have a few postdocs,
a graduate student now using BIM to study
[SPEAKER_00]: time course of forest dynamic and
disturbance regime and the greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have learned in the past is
basically AI modeling can enable us to
[SPEAKER_00]: discover mechanisms to underline systems
behavior from big data and a process-based
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: AI is very powerful to accelerate the
computational efficiency, achieve a high
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data fitting is basically accuracy in
digital training now and democratize the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But AI is a tool like any other tools and
it is powerful only if we can identify
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific issues that need AI to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people contributed to our
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to say each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get basically funding from AI
Institute and we also supported by AI
[SPEAKER_00]: Foundation AI for Science, the Schmid
Foundation, and the other LTR sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spruce sites, funding from NSF,
DOE, and the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also take this opportunity to do some
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of your students at Cornell,
you are welcome to join our training
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free for Cornell people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do take a little bit tuition fee
for people outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, your presentation is very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering in the data simulation
part, you mentioned that the parameters
[SPEAKER_03]: are constant when you apply the data
assimilation method in global simulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know some data simulation methods
which can also update the parameters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wondering what's the difference
between these methods and the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you said update probably you're
talking about like a karma filter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma filter has been used very widely by
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering scientists or professors,
I mean the disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The karma filter is due the time update
once you have observation along the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing is this karma filter probably
might not be useful tool for carbon cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: or broadly speaking, biogeochemical cycle
research because it's an update to the
[SPEAKER_00]: state and the parameter at the same times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you update the state variable,
sorry, this is very technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these become, you know,
that come out to get the mass balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to them, almost all the earth
system model, you still use the constant
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another problem is that I'm just
wondering, I mean, I noticed that you use
[SPEAKER_03]: the AI model to train the parameters,
to optimize the parameters.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to get to the true value of
the parameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very different to get this data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering how do you get to
the parameters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a very important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually those parameter is not
observable in the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can do is we use the so-called
OSSE, the observational system simulation
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment to test whether the method can
be authentically reproduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OSSE, again, this is a very technical
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the OSSE is basically use the model
given the parameter to use the model to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the output and then use the output
to train the model again to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately they recover the parameter
comparing to original parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both being and the product we did
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mean the parameters also be
reversed and then you use this reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: parameters to validate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it's a very technical talk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yiji, I had a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had, at one point you were looking
at the microbial parameters and you
[SPEAKER_01]: identified that the residence time of the
microbial biomass and then the residence
[SPEAKER_01]: time of the enzymes were having an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you able to see which of those two
parameters maybe mattered the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if could you comment on how important
those parameters were for your soil carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: estimation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those let me see if I can get back
to the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the different combination
of the those two parameters were really
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, like this one is,
you know, the microbial time of microbe is
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, yeah, this that's make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see if this enzyme turnover
time, if enzyme turnover time fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then these become negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are model exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually, once we do data
assimilation, we can constrain each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, because now we get to the
most relationship probably look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look like probably this enzyme turnover
time, I really, we need to check out the
[SPEAKER_00]: real data, but based on the relationship
we got after data assimilation,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably somewhere around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbe turnover time around 1.5
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you need the real, I mean,
exactly the value we can dig into our
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a question also in the chat from
Allison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she has two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is, what do you mean by AI can
be a force for democratizing data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not the data probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I meant is, you know, my lab has
been doing the data assimilation for about
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, now we find that being is
much easier and can do data assimilation
[SPEAKER_00]: in a much better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, this is probably much easier
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before, when I take a new student or
postdoc, they always take a long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about data assimilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now being probably make the process much
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second question she has is,
you ended with a really strong point that
[SPEAKER_01]: AI is only powerful if researchers are
answering important questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can you gain input on what the most
important questions stakeholders need
[SPEAKER_01]: answers to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what questions do your team think are
the most important to address with AI
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a very great question on
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I guess talking with
farmers and also asking scientific,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, each of the scientists generate
their own questions in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, like the kind of a seminar
and the lab meeting and talk with the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and really depends on your own
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a different, you know,
different people have a different way to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that probably I didn't answer
your question very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any other questions in the
audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you go ahead and I played with
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see if Yuqi can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems something went over my head,
but it really seems like they made you
[SPEAKER_02]: earn your tenure here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuqi, can you hear him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if I understand correctly,
a lot of your research is based in
[SPEAKER_02]: forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when changing and applying it to
agriculture, we have like management
[SPEAKER_02]: practices that can influence these
dynamics that you're describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see a possibility of using your
work and moving it towards our cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: focused questions despite the complexity
of different management decisions on a
[SPEAKER_02]: spatial scale like the globe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, you know, after I joined
the Soil and the Crop Sciences session,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a very important issue we are
exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, we don't want to just,
you know, work on forests or grassland or
[SPEAKER_00]: global scales, but also try to make some
contributions to soil and crop science
[SPEAKER_00]: sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was thinking is probably towards
the end, can you still see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see my slides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards the end, we are, you know,
I only mentioned very briefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are currently doing so-called transfer
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably if, you know, you might know
that currently none of the soil models can
[SPEAKER_00]: predict well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If even, you know, even we have like bean
or produce, we still cannot apply to the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual farmers because these,
you know, individual farmer may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are thinking about is the
so-called transfer learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is very similar to like a
charter GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charter GDP trend a lot of, you know,
trend with a lot of data, big data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they answer, when it answer your
particular questions, and the charter GDP
[SPEAKER_00]: borrow the information from other data
sets, try to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually is called a transfer
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea if we apply to here is if we
can train the model, I mean, the let's
[SPEAKER_00]: bean or produce with a lot of data at the
global scales, then we supposed to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: that knowledge to particular farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the idea we are exploring,
try to try to apply to the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea probably also applicable to
any, you know, any of these subject areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, crop year, or the wheat,
wheat control, and, you know, some other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nitrogen fixation, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of things that we
are thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we still haven't made a great
contribution to soil and crop session for
[SPEAKER_00]: individual farm, I mean, the for farm
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Yu-Chi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could thank Yu-Chi again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you all for listening and for
great questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you, Yu-Chi.
