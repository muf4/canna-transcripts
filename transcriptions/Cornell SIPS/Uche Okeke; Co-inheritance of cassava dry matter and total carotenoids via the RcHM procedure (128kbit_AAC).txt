[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be presenting today trying
to understand the co-inheritance of two
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that are very important for a
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using a method called regional
co-heritability mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a picture about what
conventional cassava looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly white to cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is what we call the yellow
cassava, which is an effort by Harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus to bio-fortify cassava with
provitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Harvest Plus, it's a program with
the CG systems and with cassava,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main target is provitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, beta-carotene is the
provitamin A that is targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But total carotenoids, which shows itself
as yellow coloration of the flesh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a good proxy for measuring
beta-carotene because the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring beta-carotene is HPLC and it's
kind of tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a prevalent problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, with the yellow cassava,
the yellow cassava has drastically low dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a problem because,
in fact, the value of cassava is the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter content and the yield that we get
per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been reports, mainly in most
African breeding programs, of negative
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between this dry matter and
this yellow coloration of the tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been counter-reports in
South America, in Sierra or Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see this negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's majorly in the African
gemplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the motivation is to understand the
genetic basis of this negative
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, we employ a method within
the regional co-heritability mapping and
[SPEAKER_00]: now walk through the procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the procedure starts by fitting a
bivariate G blob model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traits are dry matter and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is a value from chromameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just measures the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the B and the dry matter trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fit a bivariate G blob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the way the model is fitted
is that we have a stack of the two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fit the X matrix in our model is
just for the location effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the data was collected from
multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we show the genomic effect in
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we show that these effects has
covariance from two covariances.
[SPEAKER_00]: One from DK, which is a decomposition of
the genomic relationship matrix that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And VG, which is the trait by trait
covariance matrix that we are estimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same goes for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for error is simplified because we
have an identity matrix showing no
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fit this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing we back solve to
get SNP effects from these values,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the genomic values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SNP effects are estimated by
multiplying the transpose of the marker
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This marker matrix is centered,
multiplied by the inverse of the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the estimated genomic effect from each
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you back solve, we try to
standardize again using just like how we
[SPEAKER_00]: make a G matrix using the denominator from
Van Raden et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing is that we've been
SNP effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been chromosomes into segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these segments are unique 3,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are actually unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we divide the chromosome into different
segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We term these genomic segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have been them, of course,
they are at the tail end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are less than 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after being them, we solve for clonal
genomic segment values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we estimate for this by multiplying
the marker matrix again with the SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that was calculated prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we correlate this clonal genomic
segment values for dry matter and clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic segment values for the B trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we get the correlation for
each segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were modeled using BlobF90
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other matrix computations were done in
R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data for the analysis was majorly
genetic gain population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic gain is a breeding population from
the ITA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been bred since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used only data collected in two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the dry matter and the B trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said previously, but we have a third
trait we call pulp color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a binary trait that actually
measures the color of the root,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one for white and then two for
deep cream to yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use about this number of GBS SNPs,
451 clones for white, 200 clones for
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: 162 clones for yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data was from three locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this analysis in all the
populations, white, yellow, and white plus
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the result from white plus
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each bar is 3,000 SNP segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each color, so as you go from black to red
to black to red, so each color difference
[SPEAKER_00]: is a new chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see from this analysis is if
you look at the scales, here in Y is the
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated genetic correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in X, of course, is the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an overwhelmingly negative
correlation at chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it seems that other chromosomes
are a bit slight or neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for both white and yellow
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we move to the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a different result if you look at
the scales of the genetic correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In white, we observe a strong correlation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not strong in terms of the value,
but this segment shows very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also see something here that
most of the segments in white are
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We observe positive correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we move to yellow, we see something
that we saw in the previous one with white
[SPEAKER_00]: and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a different thing now occurs is that
we see that almost, if at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: apart from the neutral ones,
overwhelmingly negatively correlated for
[SPEAKER_00]: the yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go to discussion, I want to show
this genetic correlation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bivariate model itself, not the mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in white, we observe a positive
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In yellow, we observe a strong negative
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have both, we have a weak
negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correlations tend to be consistent
between these and the maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we observe a very strong negative
correlation for the yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean for the program?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that this favorable development
of high dry matter white varieties and,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, this product is already in high
demand in Africa, both for the food and
[SPEAKER_00]: starch industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will recommend a separate breeding
program for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you move to yellow,
we observe overwhelmingly that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: favor yellow variety development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is indeed discouraging because of
the high hopes we have for high harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been a lot of effort already
towards this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, a lot of clones are brought
in from SEAT and used in the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's ongoing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a good target for CRISPR if
we find what is going on completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there is also a chance that
there can be a recombinant who knows when
[SPEAKER_00]: this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in conclusion, I want to highlight
what is going on in chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromosome 1 is one that we know already
that there is an introgression that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in the 30s or after that as well
in most cultivated cassava in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chromosome 1 seems to be the culprit
in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But chromosome 1 is also good for dry
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very difficult case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually showing the methodology
because it shows a very good way to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going on between these two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, we think there will be
some progress from the results.
