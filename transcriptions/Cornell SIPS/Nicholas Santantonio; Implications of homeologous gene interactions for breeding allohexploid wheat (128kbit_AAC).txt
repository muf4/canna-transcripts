[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, one of the things I did in this
presentation was try to remove most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: math.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I gave this practice art about a week
ago, there was a lot of math in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've reduced a lot of that and
hopefully made it digestible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so yeah, as John Luke introduced,
I did my master's at New Mexico State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working on auto tetraploid alfalfa
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly in transpirational
efficiency, these are leaf peels,
[SPEAKER_00]: just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the little still model there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I got, when I came to Cornell,
I got interested in G by E because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing is a little exciting when I
get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, this was a study I
had during my master's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's under really heavy drought
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice the alfalfa that's going
right in front of it is much healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are differential responses to
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm gonna briefly talk about a
little bit of the work I've done with
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype by environment interaction,
mostly just as a plug for a R package I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm gonna move on to the part of
my PhD that I'm most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so typically we think of genotype by
or typically we think of a phenotype as
[SPEAKER_00]: some function of the genetics and the
environment in which those plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, different genotypes respond
differently to different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's really an interaction term
here, this GE, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some population mean mu,
some genetic effects, some environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, and then some deviation from that
effect, from that additive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so I was interested in utilizing
what's called an additive main effects
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplicative interaction, popularized by
Hugh Gauss himself, who's sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great to have him here so he can
point me out on all the things I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the idea is that you can think
of this problem as a matrix, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a table of genotypes in some
environments, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I've got a table of genotypes
where they're the same across all
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and a table of environment
effects where they're the same across all
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have some deviation from that,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem with this G by E term is
what we'd like to do, we typically wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: separate out the largest sources of
variability as the quote unquote true G by
[SPEAKER_00]: E and pull out the smaller sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly useful when you
have unreplicated field trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is done through, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a matrix, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can do is use singular value
decomposition to find linear combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: of that G by E matrix that are the most
associated with that G by E effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or explain the bulk of the variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now estimating how many of these we should
pull out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to find K of them is
another problem, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: unreplicated data because the G by E
effect and the error completely
[SPEAKER_00]: profoundly, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I developed an R package called
bilinear that fits AMI models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also fits other bilinear models such as
the GGE and the GREG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, some of you may be familiar
with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna talk about them in great
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit of literature on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My preferred method is the AMI because I
think it's the most parsimonious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this package that I wrote fits
various models and produces plots and
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, but more importantly, has a couple
of tests for how many of these dimensions
[SPEAKER_00]: we should pull out of the G by E term.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, we have an FR test that was
developed by PFOE in 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is great for replicated data or
at least data where you have a known
[SPEAKER_00]: within trial variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we don't have replicated data,
we can use a parametric bootstrap method
[SPEAKER_00]: that was developed by Forkman and PFOE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've implemented these in this R
package because at the time, there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: R packages that would fit these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that now there's a GGE GUI or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a graphic user interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is in R.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this fits both types of models and it
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really important is that this
can handle unreplicated data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the test tends to be more
conservative than the FR test is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really useful, especially for our
trials where we don't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_00]: replication within environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's been this big shift to
moving toward putting much more lines in a
[SPEAKER_00]: trial as opposed to replicating those
lines many, many times within a trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is available on GitHub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably needs a little bit more
polishing before it will ever go on to
[SPEAKER_00]: CRM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, from GitHub, you can
install this directly in R using the
[SPEAKER_00]: DevTools package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you not familiar with a
biplot, essentially what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: you've decomposed this thing and you're
looking at there's a gene type dimension
[SPEAKER_00]: and an environment dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the first two principal
components of the genotype and the first
[SPEAKER_00]: two principal components related to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not going to go into the
details of how to interpret these models
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, these biplots are useful
because relationships between environments
[SPEAKER_00]: or genotypes and genotypes and
environments are related by their angles,
[SPEAKER_00]: where acute angles are associated with
positive relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right angles are associated with
independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obtuse angles are negative
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Helfer here, Helfer 2014 here,
is a very different environment from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, Ketola 16, but apparently has a very
independent G by E response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these sets of environments are all
relatively similar to each other in the G
[SPEAKER_00]: by E response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can do things like we can make
these winter plots that are also out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaussian Sobel 97, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do here is we have the main
effect of the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the slope is the AME1 fit that
says how they respond to a changing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here, we've ranked the
environments and indicated them with these
[SPEAKER_00]: little black triangles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see that there are
individuals that do particularly good in
[SPEAKER_00]: poor environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their response goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the environment decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas there are individuals that do
particularly well in good environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not particularly bad environments.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was just to kind of introduce this
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked together with Lisa
Kissing-Kusek, a colleague of mine in Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Hiller's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was looking at organic wheat yield
trials that were replicated from Vermont
[SPEAKER_00]: to North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the response of organic grains
to different growing environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she found that there was significant
location or genotype by location effects
[SPEAKER_00]: such that it made sense to have these
decentralized programs in these different
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this study was nice because it was
replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we ended up using the parametric
bootstrap regardless because they tended
[SPEAKER_00]: to give more biological relevant numbers
of interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically fewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So K was low, like one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in contrast to another paper I
worked on with another student from Mark's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, Lynn Veenstra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these students have graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one hasn't quite been submitted yet,
but it's very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked on G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to show that there were
significant G by E effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, the genetic correlation
across the environments she evaluated in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York were very similar, or was
relatively high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we were able to recommend that
breeding for fructan content could be done
[SPEAKER_00]: with relatively few environments,
if only a single environment, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: under a genomic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one, we did not have replicated
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the parametric bootstrap
was really convenient to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now I'm going to move on to
allopolyploid, really what I want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my second year of grad school,
I was taking a course with Mark Soros that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think many of you have taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a paper review class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that class, we read this paper by
James McKee that was published in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970s, almost 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks about how their, OK,
so he notes that whole genome duplication
[SPEAKER_00]: events are just pervasive in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere, especially in
angiosperms, where even if there are these
[SPEAKER_00]: paleopolyploid events that happened a long
time ago, and then there's a bunch that
[SPEAKER_00]: have happened relatively recently,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks about how there's this
balance in creating new genetic variation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then preserving particularly good sets
of allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing he notes is that
allopolyploids have this ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish homozygosphety so that they can
keep good sets of alleles, but they end up
[SPEAKER_00]: being heterozygous across the subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that might sound a little confusing,
and I'm going to clarify in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that essentially, this idea of
allopolyploidy bringing relatively closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related species together into the same
organism allow for a multitude of gene
[SPEAKER_00]: functions that should allow for broader
adaptation, or adaptation in a much
[SPEAKER_00]: broader landscape, because you have these
different combinations of alleles to draw
[SPEAKER_00]: from for different genetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so a little on bread wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was the A genome ancestor and B
genome ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A genome ancestor you may know today
as einkorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the B genome species is thought to be
extinct, which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that one day we find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And roughly half a million years ago,
there was a spontaneous cross between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two closely related species,
and they produced a tetraploid that had
[SPEAKER_00]: both an A and a B genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, you took a complete
set of genes from one species and a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete set from another, and you brought
them into the same organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this happened again roughly
10,000 years ago, and maybe only once,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a related species called
Agiloxotaucii, which contributed the D
[SPEAKER_00]: genome to common wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now what we know of as common
wheat, which is bread wheat, primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: bread wheat, but of course also wheat for
cake flour, and so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: has three separate genomes, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: three sets, complete sets of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been fascinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the driving mechanism for
duplicating an entire genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a single gene, we imagine, may get
duplicated, and then you can maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: function with one copy and allow the other
one to diverge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the advantage of having
complete whole sets of genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of the lay of this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three genomes in aloe hexaploid
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It undergoes disomic inheritance,
which means there's no crossing over
[SPEAKER_00]: between homeologous chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more or less, the three sets maintain
themselves within the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't switch pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's self-pollinated, so it can fix
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes completely inbred,
and individuals will self-pollinate and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seed that is genetically identical
to the parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the self-preserving part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they maintain this allelic diversity
across the three genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the new generating part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grab a whole set of genes from one
species and one from the other species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you got two sets of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm wondering, can we think of
wheat as an immortalized hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brought two, and so here's my
justification for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in typical hybrid generation,
you have some sets of alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: X, Y, and Z, that are in an
open-pollinated population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get separated from one another,
either intentionally or unintentionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: into two heterotic groups, group A and
group B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you bring these back
together to form the hybrid, you've
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially established heterozygosity at
all loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have these allelic interactions,
which we believe may be important for what
[SPEAKER_00]: we observe as hybrid genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be bigger, which is essentially
the tendency for offspring to be better
[SPEAKER_00]: than their parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now think about the allopolyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some set of alleles in the common
ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these may diverge in the
descendant species, species A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you bring them back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, so this thing becomes inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you've done is essentially
established heterozygosity at all loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've fixed this heterozygosity
through cell fate and this disomic
[SPEAKER_00]: inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm curious about is, can we see
evidence of homeoallelic interactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: are analogous to allelic interactions that
we see in traditional diploid hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so to investigate this, I wanted to
know how this played out on agronomic
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have a winter wheat breeding
population here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of curated this data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's roughly 9,000 phenotypic records,
1,500 lines, crossed about 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: two to three environments per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have evaluated them for four traits
essentially in every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how this amount of man hours
can be distilled down into 9,000 lines on
[SPEAKER_00]: a computer file somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will definitely recognize people who
have helped put this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is the data I'm going to be
working with to describe this
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing I was interested in is
subgenome additive and interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically think, OK, so coming back to
this idea, we typically think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype as summation of all the genetic
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no reason why we can't split
these into their individual subgenome
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can estimate these using a very
standard genomic prediction model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ignore the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Math is not particularly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to say that here we're getting a
single estimate for the value of every
[SPEAKER_00]: individual based on its entire genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in this model, we get a different
estimate for each individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get three estimates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One for A, one for B, one for D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very simple to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We estimate the covariance between
individuals using molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can subset those markers based
on their native genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can calculate the covariance
between individuals based on each separate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene for all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a motivating example to think
of why we might be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine we have this little toy population
of three individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to pick two to mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The obvious choice might be individuals
one and two, which have the highest two
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if we could see for their whole
genome, but if we could see their
[SPEAKER_00]: individual effects for their subgenomes,
we'll note that while they both have very
[SPEAKER_00]: good A and B genomes, they don't tend to
have a very good D genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we mate these guys, the best value
we could possibly obtain is 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, contradictory, if you included
the third individual with the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding value, you have this potential to
bring in, while it doesn't do very good on
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B, it does have a very good B
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you increase the maximum value from
that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, this is true for both of
the two crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, potentially,
we can look at individuals that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same breeding value and find ones
that might have particularly good
[SPEAKER_00]: subgenomes that we want to incorporate for
specific crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I've done here is I've plotted
the breeding values or the value that we
[SPEAKER_00]: assign to the individual based on its
whole genome or the subgenome effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: A, B, and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've highlighted the best 5% of
the individuals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to point out briefly,
the individual that has the best A genome
[SPEAKER_00]: here is not the individual with the best
whole genome, nor does it have a
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly good B genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, the best B genome
individual has a moderate A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are these blue squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best individual for the D genome,
again, has a relatively moderate value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might say, OK, well, let's take the
individual's best for A and made it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's the best for B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, for grain yield,
maybe most of these individuals will at
[SPEAKER_00]: least be in your pool of individuals you
might select to do this, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't necessarily make these three
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see for test weight,
for example, the best D individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have a particularly good whole
genome effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be thrown out altogether and
never considered for population
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this allows us to do is it allows
us to select on complementary subgenomes
[SPEAKER_00]: for crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring ones that have different good
effects together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you could do this with any set of
chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could estimate a breeding value for
every chromosome if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this gets more complicated the more of
these you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the other thing we could do
is select on subgenomes specific like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the problems is you'll notice
the D genome has significantly less
[SPEAKER_00]: variance than the A and B, which means
that when you make selections based on
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, you are making selections on
the largest sources of variance that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the A and B genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the variation in the D genome
is going to get fixed just through drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could select based just on the
D genome, for example, for several rounds
[SPEAKER_00]: after, say, intergressing from a wild
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were just individual subgenome
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really care about is how are these
things interacting with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this through using Hadamard
products of these co-variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The math isn't really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that we can now get a value for
every individual based on its interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: between the A and B genome, B and D,
and the A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can estimate these variance
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here what I've shown is the different
terms A, B, D, A by B, A by D for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimates are in red with their
standard deviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the violin plots are
distributions from sampling that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we subset the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We estimate those variance components.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually doing cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do is just see how stable
is that variance estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice that for the most part,
they align very well with their estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, you'll notice there's very
different genetic architecture between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two traits, while the B genome
explains most of the variance in both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that here the D genome
explains a lot more for plant height than
[SPEAKER_00]: it does for granule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the A by D and B by D interaction
effects are much larger than they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: granule, where they're actually very
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So granule doesn't have a whole lot going
on for subgenome interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see it for plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can show that these things sum
to the same variance as the whole genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, as well as their interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can incorporate these interactions into
a genomic prediction model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that when we model just the
additive effects of the whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the three individuals and then sum
them, you'll see that we get essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same prediction accuracy for all
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we incorporate episodic
interactions, one of the things we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: is incorporate all interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can just incorporate the
interactions across the subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll notice that, again, you see what
we see increases in prediction accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the traits, except for arguably
granule here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that those increases are the same,
regardless of whether or not we're
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling all pairwise or just the pairwise
across subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the problem is that these things
are not independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a population under pure
Hardy-Weinberg, these variance components
[SPEAKER_00]: should be independent of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have population structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we see in something like
rice, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a PC plot of the genetic
covariance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're explaining maybe 18% or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the variance, which is the first two
principal components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some population structure in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably mostly due to the fact
that we have many small families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wheat is done with pedigree selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not some big random mating
population of cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very specific crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are few individuals from each cross
that go into an advanced trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be confounding of estimates
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had an attempt to try to remove
the largest sources of variation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker matrix before we actually calculate
how related individuals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, under Hardy-Weinberg,
these variances should be independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, in a breeding program,
they will not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take the marker matrix and
decompose it using singular variances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do that using the value
decomposition, which is obviously my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite tool, because that's what we use
for the AMI model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can pull out the first few
principal components as population
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling that Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reform the marker matrix after
we've pulled that population structure out
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of the markers at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we reform this by setting the first k
singular values of b to 0 and multiplying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make this d tilde, multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Math isn't important again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we just incorporate our
population structure as a fixed effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the sum of our different
subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can pull out this m and make a
covariance from that, so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: while having removed population structure
from all three of them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do that, what I've done here is
I've plotted in the black lines here
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the correlation of genetic
relationships estimated based on the A
[SPEAKER_00]: genome and the D genome, or the A genome
and the B genome, or the B genome and the
[SPEAKER_00]: B genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that they tend to have a
high correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because individuals that are
closely related are going to be closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to each other, no matter which
pieces of DNA you choose to calculate that
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, but also because of
population structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like we have this nice shelf
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So roughly around a k of maybe four or
five, it looks like we kind of hit this
[SPEAKER_00]: asymptotic relationship, where the more
principal components we pull out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: marker matrix, we don't get much reduction
in the correlation of the relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: across the subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also take a hit in the amount of
variance in the entire matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that k appears to be removing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling out this population structure
appears to be removing these variance
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I increase k, do I see big changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice for the A, B,
and the D genomes, no matter what the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of k for these four traits, the additive
values don't differ very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their interaction components do have
rank changes, especially for these
[SPEAKER_00]: different, for traits that are not
granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really unclear whether or not
we're pulling population structure out or
[SPEAKER_00]: also genetic signal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're related to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did was I used the variance of the
variance estimates to decide whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not we should be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, there is not much change
in this covariance.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the variance components related to the
interactions can have a high correlation,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of how much population
structure you pull out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, this was probably not,
there probably isn't a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there is, it's really unclear,
at least in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe very important for certain
populations that have very strict sets of
[SPEAKER_00]: population structure, like in reds,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, that's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we estimate the additive effects
relatively well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not certain if we get good
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't lose prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no reason not to do this from a
predictive perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's unclear how you would then make
selections on each individual one,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a complementary subgenome
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select individuals that have
particularly good A's versus individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: that have particularly good B's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can select certain subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about this method is we
don't need to know much about where the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker lives, only what genome it came
from, which is important in crops like
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat, where for a long time, we knew
where markers belonged from a perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: of what chromosome they were on,
but had no idea what their relative
[SPEAKER_00]: position next to one another was,
because each of the chromosome arms was
[SPEAKER_00]: assembled independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true for a lot of polyploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequence assembly is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's replicated, it's like you're
trying to sequence three different things
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to assign who goes where.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this paper is in preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping we're going to get this one out
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about explicitly
modeling homeologous relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can consider a two-locus model,
right, where we have a locus B,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, on one genome, and a locus C on
another genome with additive effects alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: B, alpha C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their interaction.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's different ways to think
about how epistasis works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a classic additive by additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into this too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you get from multiplying
marker scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone who's done this has probably
seen this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're contrasting the two homozygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a weird thing to say,
because remember, they're all homozygotes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the heterozygotes across the genomes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the duplicate factor
model, where essentially having AB or AC
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having both of them does not give you
any further effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this coefficient was two,
it would be completely additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same as having one or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to introduce this idea of
sub-functionalization epistasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this model is flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows both everything from a duplicate
factor all the way to an additive and then
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to give you an example of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some ancestor allele A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is allowed to change into the two
descendant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that's brought back together in
the allopolyploid, you essentially get the
[SPEAKER_00]: sum of those two effects times some
divergence coefficient, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can see that if D equals 1,
this is completely additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If D equals half, it's completely
additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's somewhere in between a half
and one, there is some partial redundancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say partial redundancy,
I mean these genes still, to some extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: perform similar functions, such as having
one or the other doesn't result in a total
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need both of them to have complete
functionality in the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is your classic epistasis
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you have a change from little c to
big C, change from little b to big B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to explain this using an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a biparental population where
the two parents each had a single dwarfing
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, the dwarfing genes that were very
famous from the Green Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, if you have one of these
dwarfing genes, you are what's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-dwarf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings the height of the plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such that when you put a bunch of
fertilizer on it, it doesn't fall over,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is called lodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when obviously the plants fall over
and they lodge, total grain loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making these guys short is good,
but you don't want to make them too short,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is this population
had one parent had a dwarfing gene on the
[SPEAKER_00]: B genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one had a dwarfing gene on the D
genome, this RHT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now because we made this cross,
there are double dwarfs in this
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have two mutant genes that are
completely gibberic acid-insensitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've tagged them with markers
that were relatively close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the mean of the
population of the double dwarf,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we can look at the effect of
adding a wild type B allele, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: linear response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, there's a linear response when
we add a wild type B allele to the double
[SPEAKER_00]: dwarf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now based on additivity, you would
expect the mean of the double wild type to
[SPEAKER_00]: be roughly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we observe this, it is
significantly lower than you might expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this deviation from the
additive model, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic epistasis, change the slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and so this value delta is how we can
estimate this directly, and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate this divergence coefficient B,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then essentially, this is this great
example of 1 plus 1 does not equal 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some functional redundancy
between these two genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is different from there being
pure redundancy, in which case you would
[SPEAKER_00]: see this, where this delta is exactly
where this slope is now flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one or the other gives you the
phenotype, the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is obviously different from
seeing an increase in response.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's one gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to know, do I see this
pattern across the genome, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so using the International Wheat
Genome Sequencing Consortium, WebSeq1,
[SPEAKER_00]: with roughly 1,100 coding sequences,
I was able to basically establish
[SPEAKER_00]: homeoallelic gene sets, roughly 18,000
triplicates, 5,000 doubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So triplicates means one on A,
one on B, one on D, in the expected
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the duplicates is one on A and
one on B, but you're missing one on,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, D, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we end up with about 23,000 homeologous
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tag those sets with GBS
markers, so now I can track them,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up with a total of about
10,000 marker sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we look at, so what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take these molecular markers,
and we can do GWAS, right, which is our
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite thing to do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've done is I've plotted the 21
chromosomes of wheat around the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've indicated these are like
Manhattan plots here, so these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative log 10 of the p values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see we don't have a bunch of
huge hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant height, we have the dwarfing gene on
4D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heading date, we have PPD1 on 2D,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a whole lot of
large-effect TTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you noticed from earlier,
we had a high prediction accuracy with
[SPEAKER_00]: these scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is genetic signal in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be, that just indicates
that there's many genes that are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at that are involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, we don't find a whole lot of,
quote unquote, significant homeologous
[SPEAKER_00]: episodic interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are indicated by these hoops
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple on three, a couple on four,
a couple on five, a couple on seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively few.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we can look at the global trend
of these individuals, or of these loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see, do they increase
prediction accuracy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get to that in a couple of
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done here is I've plotted,
oh my gosh, I'm running low on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done is I've plotted one
homeolog, say the A genome homeolog
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, against the other homeolog,
which is, say, the B genome homeolog
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in color, I've indicated the
direction of the interaction, of their
[SPEAKER_00]: pairwise interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their magnitude is shown with the size
of the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that we see this drastic
negative trend between the additive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and their interaction,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a positive, if both of your
alleles are positive, your interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to be negative, and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, yay, this is totally
showing me exactly what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sub-functionalization,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has to do with how we coded this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were doing is we were
contrasting genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to assign who has,
what is the functional copy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is using 01 marker coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is, so to check to make
sure I'm not crazy, I simulated a data set
[SPEAKER_00]: using the exact same parameters from the
original, or data sets, using the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same parameters from the original
population, only here, I intentionally did
[SPEAKER_00]: not allow them to have interactions,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't touch the LD in the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we still observe this
trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, oh, man, bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is this is a
multicollinearity problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the predictors are correlated to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can ask, are they greater than
expected by chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did was I plotted those
epistatic, or interaction effects from the
[SPEAKER_00]: true data and the additive-only simulated
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's no effect, we should not
see any deviation from this diagonal line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I multiplied them by their additive
effect sign so that if they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative relationship, they should have a
low tail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have a positive relationship,
they should have a tail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice for a heading date,
we see this push down that's indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: that these are far more negative than
expected by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see some for plant height down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see it reflected, not a lot for
grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unclear for test weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like a whole lot of
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, if I remove the LD pattern
in the population, then I see this effect
[SPEAKER_00]: is, to some extent, emphasized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so not a lot of large effect
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do they increase prediction and
accuracy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that modeling all pairwise gives us
this bump from the additive model,
[SPEAKER_00]: all pairwise interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the homeologous epistatic interactions
explain between 60% to 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a very small increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sanity's sake, we also sampled random
pairs within and across the genome of
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at their prediction
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that we actually got higher
prediction accuracy with these random
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs within and across, which might be
like, oh, man, did we miss something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we expect random pairs within a
genome or across the genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we expect the subgenomes to have
higher prediction accuracies than the
[SPEAKER_00]: homeologous loci?
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, I would expect them to be
about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason, I think, is we see a much
higher rate of linkage disequilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm plotting the leakage
disequilibrium parameter d prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the solid line here is the
homeologous set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the dotted lines are two random
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice that there's an enrichment
for fixation at homeoallelic sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain pairs of homeoalleles are being
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of this would be the
dwarfing gene, just to bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most modern wheat varieties have a single
dwarfing gene because they get the reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: stature that helps them resist lodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have both dwarfing genes,
you're too short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not agronomically harvestable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done is we fixed pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fixed pairs where you have a wild type
and a mutant and a mutant and a wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never have a double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's rare to have double wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may explain why we're seeing lower
prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, physical position is not
necessarily a good indicator of LD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both position and the time of those
mutations that indicate LD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into this in too
much detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also some difficulty in
picking specific sets of markers to call
[SPEAKER_00]: homeologous, given that we're just using
physical position to assign these,
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to, say, linkage to single
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that would be really difficult to do
because it's not just LD between the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker and the functional polymorphism,
but also LD between the marker and the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional polymorphism on the other arm
and their interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a problem for simple GWAS
tagging these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a problem for all pairwise
interactions, because you test everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, we're only testing a very small
subset of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see these interactions tend to be
less than additive for some traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: appears pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeolylic pairs explain some of this
increase in genetic predictability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not more so than random pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be due to LD or low pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a better way to pair markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my last five minutes, OK,
and so this paper is essentially written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be tightened up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're waiting for Wheat Genome
Consortium to publish their paper so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can publish ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had the genome available for quite
some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't let anyone publish on it
until they publish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we're waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last few minutes, I'm going to
go into a strategy I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a problem tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this question of, am I having a
hard time tagging specific homeoalleles
[SPEAKER_00]: with specific markers?
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be in high LD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if we use more than one pair?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked about the pairwise epistasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with this is a multiple test
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 11,000 markers or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with 67 million tests in the
Bonferroni correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to see, especially for
interactions which tend to only have
[SPEAKER_00]: maximized variability at allele
frequencies of 0.5, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as those allele frequencies go to 0,
you reduce the effect of the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that variance gets partitioned to
additive variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we just looked at chromosome
arms?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we took individual chromosome arms
and looked at contrast to see if those
[SPEAKER_00]: arms were interacting with one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would drastically reduce the,
now I'm only looking at 42 different
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: 861 total tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Bonferroni correction is way less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, essentially what I did was I
took our model and I pulled out a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of chromosome arms and modeled their
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do a series of likelihood
ratio tests to determine if the additive
[SPEAKER_00]: facts for the interaction are and the
interaction is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then essentially we can plot the
p-values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in light gray is the additive
p-value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the additive effect significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in dark gray is the interaction effect
significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that essentially,
so these would be considered significant
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are essentially p-value of 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll notice for these four
traits, most of the chromosome arms have
[SPEAKER_00]: an additive effect, a significant additive
effect, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect large pieces of chromatin to
have effects on a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll notice most of the interactions
are not, which is good, because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: expect all of these things to be
interacting with each other necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, when these variance
parameters are estimated on boundary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a problem with essentially,
they end up being 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you get this big lump of
p-values around 1 instead of the expected
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just want to show, so these are
the results from a Bonferroni correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is we see some sites
where it looks like we have a 4D,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6A, 7D big regulator, or a site that
appears to be interacting with many loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is maybe suggestive of some kind of
D regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we relax this cut off a little bit and
just look at interactions that were
[SPEAKER_00]: significant at, say, 0.001, just to look
at a pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that these are causing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that this appears, we see these
sites where just a bunch of interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: with a single locus or a single
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one for heading date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's affecting a bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see some of these hotspots on
7D, 7B here, and 4B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or excuse me, 4D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, there was a paper by Jiang that
came out last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also saw this enrichment at 7B
and 7D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is essentially the same plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theirs is rotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they saw that these two chromosomes
appeared to be influencing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also saw an area on 4A, which we
didn't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw that 4D seemed to be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at the homeologous chromosome
arms, we don't see a whole lot of evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Bonferroni correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only were to consider all of the ones
that are significant at, say, 0.05 for
[SPEAKER_00]: their interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're probably wondering what the
colors are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors are basically colored the
relationship between the additive and the
[SPEAKER_00]: epistatic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're blue, there's a positive
relationship between the additive and the
[SPEAKER_00]: epistatic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're red, there's a negative
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're black or gray, there's no
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on just a correlation coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I'd like to point
out from last minute is that the 4BL and
[SPEAKER_00]: 4DL here had a really strong negative
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we plotted this, you can see
there's this drastic negative relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between the additive effects and the
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be another indicator of some
culturalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we looked at this for a
different trait, so this was for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for test weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not see the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at our spot where we
assumed we might see the interaction of
[SPEAKER_00]: the two dworkin genes, we don't have a
whole lot of them from the B genome in our
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't really see much of a pattern
here, although there is a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: positive correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we see a lot of these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granule has a few, potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we see some regions that
have large regulatory regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be interacting with many different
loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see strong relationships between
some of these homeologous arm pairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that we may have some of these
homeoalleles, that there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships between these homeoalleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, I think that a lot of this
stuff probably is really suggestive and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably needs a lot more fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot more research can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that there are some other
populations that you could look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to a breeding population,
where you fix a lot of these interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could look at a synthetic wheat
population, which would maximize these
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that there is much more
research needed into how these three
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes are talking to each other to
produce a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my PAG talk was in translational
genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave some of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to figure out what the
translation was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my translation is allopolyploids are
not diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 100 years, we have been
treating allopolyploid crops as diploids
[SPEAKER_00]: because they undergo disomic inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can treat them as diploids because
the chromosomes pair up and segregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in a behaved manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we now have the molecular tools to
start to look at these things as the
[SPEAKER_00]: immortal hybrids that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to acknowledge my
committee members, Mark Sorrell,
[SPEAKER_00]: John Luke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yannick is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark couldn't be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is at CIMIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jason Meese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great folks in the Yannick Sorrell's
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked closely with Lisa Kissinkusek and
Lynn Binstra on some of the GBI stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also gotten some really good input
from Tarju and Uche and Marnin and
[SPEAKER_00]: Roberto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roberto, I will point out, was the first
person that said, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could go in and, like, look at those
coding sequences and then see if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: find pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, yeah, good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, without the help of
the folks at the Small Grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: David Venture, Amy Fox, and Justin Chavez,
and James Sanaka, who are all here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have had this data to ask these
questions with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I very much appreciate their work
into this, as well as the relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: we've developed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping you guys late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like to thank my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've given me a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't have finished this without
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank, particularly,
my father, who is here today, and my
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend, Amy, who also joined us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a little over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a couple of questions,
I'm sorry to keep you guys a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had one slide where the x-axis was a
scalarization of the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ranges from minus 1 to plus 2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says presented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think of that as an asymmetry in
that measure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I centered all of this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically, but what I did was I,
no, no, no, I can explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I didn't want to do was center the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all standardized data,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You subtract the mean and divide by the
standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I could have centered within each
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't want to do that because then
you are assuming that every environment
[SPEAKER_00]: has the same variance, both error and
genetic variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did instead was I centered on
everything at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then if the environment sizes,
for example, I don't remember which
[SPEAKER_00]: direction it was in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it heavier on the negative side or
heavier on the positive side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I see you remember it was heavier on
the positive side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be from if there were larger
trials that tended to be better trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones would push that whole thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're taking a meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you summarize that thing,
you're taking a single point for something
[SPEAKER_00]: that had maybe 400 genotypes in it that
was a particularly good environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: then another single point that maybe only
had 200 genotypes that was particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: bad, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to shift that mean point
of the environmental I mean roughly they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be close to centered around zero,
but they weren't because I think because I
[SPEAKER_00]: centered the data as a whole as opposed to
within the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had I done it within environment,
they should have all been smacked out at
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sort of sitting here mulling over
the question about neopunctualization
[SPEAKER_04]: within a very simple diploid because
that's one of my favorite genome in my
[SPEAKER_04]: mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have neopunctualization
within duplicated genes in every even
[SPEAKER_04]: simple diploid, but we don't tend to think
about the opportunity cost because
[SPEAKER_04]: duplication is a much more conservative
process than full genome polyploidization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, if the hypothesis is true,
which is that basically every angiosperm
[SPEAKER_04]: has undergone at least one round,
maybe two or three, of whole genome
[SPEAKER_04]: duplication and then subsequently gain and
loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, do you see the kind of
preferential loss of loci in these more,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in these replete polyploids that
we see in the long term perspective on all
[SPEAKER_04]: of our ancient polyploid, which is that
they actually get rid of more than half
[SPEAKER_04]: the genes that they don't want to bother
to maintain either because if you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if you chomp, they are
functionally done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe there's a cost to the
neopunctualization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just asking that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a continuum?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you expect to see simply the loss
and how much loss do you see in the 3G?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to repeat the question, essentially the
idea is in diploid species, you have genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that get duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then those are oftentimes
subsequently lost because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so during a whole genome duplication,
yeah, and that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do we see that same thing happen
in all the polyploid?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it happens really drastically,
especially very shortly after the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually go through this, this weird
genome shock moment where they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, well, how am I going to deal
with all of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so oftentimes big, big chunks break
because you're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: negative epistasis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this other thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens where you can think of a gene
from this species and a gene from that
[SPEAKER_00]: species, while they work completely fine
within their own species, you bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: together and all of a sudden like,
think of like a homeodimer, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The homeodimer is formed from the protein
products within the two species are
[SPEAKER_00]: functional, but you might have a thing
where they can still bind together and
[SPEAKER_00]: form a heterodimer across these two really
closely related genes that may disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that when that kind of thing
happens, there is a push to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I don't know about a push,
but there is a selective advantage to drop
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these really important,
and we do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, so of the 110,000 or so genes in
the genome, I was only able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: triplicate for like, so 110,000 genome,
you divide that by three, you're roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a haploid number of 33,000
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was only able to get 18 of them that had
at least three copies, or no, was it at
[SPEAKER_00]: least two copies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at least two copies, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so a third of the genome has been
lost, and there was a bunch of singletons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that happens is you get a
lot of tandem duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tandem duplications are super interesting
because they have a tendency to be
[SPEAKER_00]: co-inherited, whereas duplications across
chromosomes, there's no linkage that holds
[SPEAKER_00]: them together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be lost very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, did I answer your question,
I think?
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think is part of this picture that
you're painting is that there may be
[SPEAKER_04]: immortal hybrids in the sense of these,
but there's immortal hybrids in everything
[SPEAKER_04]: and just from, but the ones that have
evolved longest have gotten rid of most
[SPEAKER_04]: of, they retain these duplications that
seem to have an advantage, and they get
[SPEAKER_04]: rid of things that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they diverge too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this thought that essentially
all neofunctionalization goes to a process
[SPEAKER_00]: of subfunctionalization, where at first
they start off with the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: function, and then you have small
mutations that change them a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then eventually they develop such
different pieces, and I think that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at genes, genes have these
domains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that you can stick
these domains together and have this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: be functional here, and that thing be,
you know, so you can like, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like mix and match.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are they, what are those
toys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're like legos, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so, yeah, I think it's really
important, and that I would be super
[SPEAKER_00]: curious to try this in a species that is
kind of in between that whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication event and being already
becoming a diploid, and seeing if we could
[SPEAKER_00]: find evidence of this happening,
you know, across non-homologous sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really fascinating,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they lost more, let's say,
do you see more loss in the DGNL,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the new interloper, into your...
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking about this for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when you bring, I think that
also, when you bring a thing in,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably a lot of stuff that's
good, but most of it, it actually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some question like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assume that most, I should
tabulate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should see how many of the ones I saw,
you know, where the third copy that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have was from the DGNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna cut you off.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So... This has been a production of
Cornell University on the web at cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: .edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
