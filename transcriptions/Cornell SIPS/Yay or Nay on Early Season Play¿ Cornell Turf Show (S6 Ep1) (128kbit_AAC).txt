[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to our sixth year,
huh, Carl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of howling at the moon as we started out
early on in the pandemic days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we do it for a very short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's starting to come together in
Clippings podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if those of you, I haven't really,
I'll draw attention to this some other
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but for those of you that are
interested in listening to some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts that we've taken from the show
over the years, we've got an ace undergrad
[SPEAKER_01]: communication specialist, Jake Sikowski,
who's turning our previous shows into
[SPEAKER_01]: little snippets or clippings of really
informative stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you'll pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Carl promoted it through the
email just a couple of weeks ago.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without any further ado, I think opening
day should be a national holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the Yanks and even the Red
Sox are tied for first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it's the last time that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to put up with with Red Sox fans,
but you know, the grass is green,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ball's flying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now till October, it's every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl hates this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get my, let me get my cursor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in light of that, Greg Chauvers and
the guys at Saugerties already at it,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting those infields ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big differences between upstate and
downstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about the weather as we get
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for sure, you know, working these
infields, this is why a lot of fields have
[SPEAKER_01]: been covered by the rain and the rain has
become synthetic because you got to have
[SPEAKER_01]: people who know what they're doing,
getting the clay ready this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why Greg's facility hosts so
many games, so many, so many tournaments
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is the envy of communities far and
wide and something you just don't see as
[SPEAKER_01]: much anymore with this deep commitment to
baseball in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course it's a multi-use facility,
but big shout out to Greg and the guys in
[SPEAKER_01]: Saugerties at Canteen Memorial that have
been good supporters of the show over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl, without any further ado,
I know you're going to take a different
[SPEAKER_01]: tack today, but as I said earlier,
you were, you were, you were a convivial,
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasant guy hanging out with Dave Hicks,
winning your mid amateur championship a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you've got something to say
about people in general today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about golfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to talk so much
about sort of evidence-based turf
[SPEAKER_00]: management, best management practices with
the science tells us we're going to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: all these, these next 10 weeks talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of put this, you know,
it's a little bit facetious, but does it
[SPEAKER_00]: even matter that we can produce good grass
or bad grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you know, this is an example
for those watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we fertilize this, in this case,
it's perennial ryegrass in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we fertilize it a little bit,
we get less weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to do things really
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have to use herbicides as
much, but the product or the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes does not equal what the person
using the grass feels as they're using the
grass.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and this is most known in,
in golf courses, a person is going to play
[SPEAKER_00]: a golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just how good the golf course is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the customer experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at this a long time ago with
our New York state park golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not an efficient way to do this
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through thousands of online
reviews, Google reviews, Facebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: Yelp golf advisor, and I would manually
input how many stars the review gave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are comments, I would keep
those comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would sort of categorize them,
especially poor reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were they saying about the golf
course that they didn't like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could basically bucket them into
four categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a piece of play, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Golfers want to play really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really slow, they don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amenities, things like, is there water to
drink on the golf course?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there bathrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did not expect what we found,
which was that over 50% of the reviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: 51% of poor reviews mentioned bad customer
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the reason they had a poor time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this review just encapsulates
it so well at one of the state park
[SPEAKER_00]: courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you check in, it's got a DMV feel
without attitudes to match.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll then go to a starter who's as
friendly as shingles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're over two after the TSA like
procedure to begin your round.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a rectal exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're on the course, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll soon forget about it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a poor review that says,
Hey, the grass was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave it two out of five stars
because I spent five hours there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my five minutes interacting with
people somehow screwed that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the superintendent's
listening, probably is, is a relatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just state parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty much true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like whenever we say this to people,
or I make this comment, Carl in a meeting,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's head starts nodding and they
say, here's what they said to us last
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: People in the front of the house,
don't start out like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golfers do this to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just golfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out this is not just golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to highlight Maggie writer's
blog post here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maggie's doing some really cool blog
posts, not just lawn and landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also some sports turf stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure she'll do golf stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a, she, she built a code that did
this all for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she scraped all these reviews from a
Austin, Texas landscaping company,
[SPEAKER_00]: one company.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a sentiment analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the code looks through all the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the comments and sort of groups them
into these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the positive reviews for this company,
66% of the time, the most often cited
[SPEAKER_00]: topic for, for a good review was
professionalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tech, the technicians were polite,
professional and friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the number one, often cited thing
in a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the negative reviews,
that's when you start to see the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the poor results showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 64% said, the reason I'm giving it a
poor review is because I didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at all the other things on
this list, Frank, 39% of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: missing appointments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was why they didn't have a good
experience billing 23% of the time sales
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also saying like, Hey,
sometimes good reviews can be driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the interesting thing here is
you might not provide the best product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're nice, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, anything you need that can make your
customers really happy and probably get
[SPEAKER_00]: returned business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it comes back to this Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've said in the past,
you're not, uh, you'd rather not be around
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd rather just look at the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need golfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just grow the grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back to it's a people business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes how we treat people is just
as important, if not more important than
[SPEAKER_00]: the product we produce, the grass we
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say this, Carl, we often say this
on the golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, a lot of people know
how to grow grass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, staying at a golf course
meeting golf course superintendent for 30
[SPEAKER_01]: years is more about growing grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you know how to grow grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no magic to growing grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The changing climate, the increasing
pressures on the turf, the lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: investment in infrastructure up until
recently, I think made it harder just to
[SPEAKER_01]: permit that bare minimum of having decent
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think your, your, your data shows
that listen, you got weeds all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be pissed about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got dead greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be pissed about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you meet this minimum sort of bar,
right, you've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's an average lawn got to look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do we do because we get paid to
do it, especially in a lawn care business
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're only really getting paid when
you apply something or mow something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and you're not really paid for
sort of producing that landscape as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to continue in the vein,
Carl, of grass being a people business,
[SPEAKER_01]: but deflected a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these old guys, Piper and
Oakley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wrote this book, Turf for Golf
Courses in the 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first line on the first page of
the book, first book ever written about
[SPEAKER_01]: golf courses is this, good grass is
conditioned by two great factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: climate and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latter can be modified.
[SPEAKER_01]: The former must be accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with what we've had to
accept.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a proper winter, as my British
friends would say, a proper winter with
[SPEAKER_01]: good cold temperatures, adequate,
but still not excessive snowfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even snowfall along the lakes,
you know, they got dumped on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's snowed every day on the tug
hill plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those poor people got like 12,
13 feet of snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's barely a hill to ski down it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just flat farmland on the plateau
that just gets buried in snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had the cold temperatures and
then freezing and then thawing and raining
[SPEAKER_01]: and freezing again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and then you see ground heaving
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just say we had, last year we
had a proper summer and a proper winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now coming out of the proper winter,
we got that annual bluegrass in some
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody, but some places are
definitely showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, if you're trying to kill it,
like we're trying to do it on our sports
[SPEAKER_01]: field and you made a couple of
applications of pro grass last year on
[SPEAKER_01]: your rye grass, even with a little bit of
bluegrass in there, we, we smoked,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris was able to smoke the annual
bluegrass on our, on our game field out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you go out and it's like,
wow, is that snow mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's dead annual bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in this monthly departures
from normal in Ithaca, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was warmer than normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at January, February, March,
April.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at, you know, two to almost
eight degrees above normal month after
[SPEAKER_01]: month, last winter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last winter, 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you see, as we got through the
summer, June and July was warmer than
[SPEAKER_01]: normal, a little bit cooler in August,
warmer in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the story, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Warm fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you can see at the end of the
top chart and the beginning of the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: chart where you're cooler than normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've been on the cold side,
a little bit of a roller coaster,
[SPEAKER_01]: but certainly warm in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing about the fall that
persisted was the incredibly dry weather,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Annual departure from normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at two inches below normal,
October, November, and December.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the story and it has persisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the, you know, some people in the
50 to 75% of normal, more in the 75 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting out the season on the
dry side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last fall, it was so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sparks were setting off landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prospect Park had a fire that's going to
cost a quarter million dollars or more to
[SPEAKER_01]: replace just the natural landscape from,
you know, homeless people in an area,
[SPEAKER_01]: barbecuing, spark goes into the woods,
boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 acres burned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now from as far as what got smoked from
last year, I'd say towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year, the crabgrass came on and really
took over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had a dry season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawns really started to suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are not going to recover
well, but if you see crabgrass skeletons
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, my opinion right now,
just go in there, scuff it up and throw
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go for the pre-emergent yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some grass growing there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as we've learned in a recent paper,
and we're going to talk about this as we
[SPEAKER_01]: get going, grass alone there doesn't stop
the crabgrass from coming, but it does
[SPEAKER_01]: slow the emergence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, just a note about if you're heading
out to spray your pre-emergent or you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go out and do anything, we've got the
runoff risk tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, for the Ithaca area,
we're low, but we're starting to build up
[SPEAKER_01]: as the rains are going to start coming
through next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see by Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday of next week, when are we getting
[SPEAKER_01]: to the 31st?
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday, Tuesday of next week, you're going
to start to have great runoff potentials
[SPEAKER_01]: in certain areas where the rains are
coming through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check the runoff miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very important time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to say, I see a lot of farmers
running around spreading manure at this
[SPEAKER_01]: time of year, and it's just not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, late grub damage, still obvious this
spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Kyle Wickings has got my head
spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got my head spinning a little bit
that if they're feeding late, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: crane fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is some damage I saw in October
in Central Park with some grubs there and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to look at the anal slit and seeing
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's favorite job, but we were
able to see that it was, I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: Oriental beetle at this location.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the grubs themselves, the turf's
looking fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grubs are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem with this area is the
vertebrate damage, and that remains the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't necessarily the grub pressure as
much as it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's talk about getting the
season going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils are barely in the 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walt Nelson's probably got, he can't get
out his front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still snow up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had just a dusting yesterday of snow
when we were having the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So barely creeping into the 50s all the
way down into Delmarva.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're a slow start to the year for sure
here in March.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this past week was cooler along the
coast, warmer by the lakes, a little
[SPEAKER_01]: warmer inland, a little cooler by the
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Carl, I don't have to
remind everybody, but the growth model is
[SPEAKER_01]: there and the grass isn't growing very
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris has got people playing on the soccer
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got golfers playing on the golf course,
but it's important to keep in mind the
[SPEAKER_01]: grass isn't growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a question for you at the end,
pal, about how to reconcile this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what about moisture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the last week, we got a good dump
along the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left here, you can see we got a
pretty good dump along the coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but pretty dry inland, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of us have been a bit on the dry
side, but definitely wet along the coast
[SPEAKER_01]: last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like it's going to be a
little bit of the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get dry along the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start to see some drying
out, but to the north, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to see some rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are into seedhead suppression,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, if you're really serious
in the golf business about suppressing
[SPEAKER_01]: seedheads, you're making that proxy
application with your snowmold application
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's become pretty much the
standard since Sean Askew started doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that work a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that follow-up application is due in a
lot of places, which seems hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: believe, but certainly the models have
been pretty consistent about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want to keep in mind, you're
spraying a growth regulator at a time
[SPEAKER_01]: where you want the grass to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to reconcile that sort of
dissonance in your head that, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I want it to grow, but I'm spraying
a growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Carl, I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to set you up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got about 15 minutes to have this chat
because I know you're a golfer and I see
[SPEAKER_01]: this bubble up every once in a while and I
want to see what you think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a pitch and then I want
to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's green and open early.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a golf course superintendent.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Morristown, New Jersey, hosted on
TurfNet, uses covers, gets the greens
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green and open early, good deal,
bad deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here's the impact covers have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here where you put covers on,
you warm that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that warmth going, you get soils
activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you heat the soil mass, it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up until then, you're staring at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see on the left, the airification
holes are filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, you can still see them very
clearly, especially if you're doing late
[SPEAKER_01]: airification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just make a note that heavy blankets
of sand worked very well this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it on our golf course and a number
of other golf courses this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy blankets of sand worked really well
for getting things going and then
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalizing on maybe using some coarser
particles, maybe even airifying a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, getting them into the profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time to be in golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're record round numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we look at annual rounds, you know,
we've gone, talk about a roller coaster,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're having a ball right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it's the sun is shining and
everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's spending money on golf
courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of infrastructure projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit in a room of superintendents that
I'm speaking to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, how many people got projects,
bunkers, irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of the hands are up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So golf is, you know, people are playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spending it back in deferred
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of this has to do with remote
work, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the remote worker looks like
nowadays, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about this with our state park
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the National Golf Foundation has
found a 25% increase in weekday play since
[SPEAKER_01]: the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a workday study that was done
recently that I stumbled onto,
[SPEAKER_01]: a work from home study about the,
it was a really long presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 80, 90 slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of it is this golf effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that you look at cell phone data
in a community, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there's golf courses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cell phone data tracking where people are,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2019 on Mondays, 12,000 people were
heading or at golf courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2022, 24,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the increase in play on Monday
through Thursday through Friday,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't see it as much on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still playing on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still at the golf, but now they're
at the golf course all week, not just on
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the data also shows they're
taking the early tee times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you used to have a little bit more
time in the morning, except for the deuce
[SPEAKER_01]: sweepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to get ahead of those
guys, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you let them go and then the rest of
the people are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got a whole pile of people coming
early and you want to fit it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to fit it in before they start
working remotely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not working on Mondays in the
office and they're not working on Fridays
[SPEAKER_01]: in the office anymore, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only there Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now Monday maintenance days might have
to be Tuesday maintenance days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does that make it look?
[SPEAKER_01]: But come Friday, Saturday, Sunday for your
weekends, you don't have four days to
[SPEAKER_01]: recover from a verticut and saying you got
three days to recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the question, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what I hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should open and play whenever we can to
maximize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a private club, Craig Currier
never closes Glen Oaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flags are always in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the grass, if you can see the grass,
you're playing out there access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you're in the business of golf,
like our entry brother, you want rounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's these other people that
say, oh, no, we got to stay close as long
[SPEAKER_01]: as we can to preserve the golf course for
the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opening now will hurt us later in the
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have this same argument for Ben
Palmer could have this same argument in on
[SPEAKER_01]: play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, why can't I use this field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, you're going to do damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Carl, where are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it to you, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've you've put both sides there
and I am split to as a golfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things to do is in
March and I keep track of every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: my first round, it's always second,
third week in March, I go up talent tree
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just one of the best experiences
of the year is I get out for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see the ball fly in twenty twenty
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like, you know, it creates
this inertia momentum for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I want to golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50 degrees out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from an operator perspective,
it's it's the most money you can make with
[SPEAKER_00]: no cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to mow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I I put I can put temporary tees
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good option, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tea services.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got artificial mats for par threes,
I think that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're making basically free money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need one person in the pro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the cash and go out and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will come and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a hundred rounds in central
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, on March 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I'm a superintendent,
I'm saying exactly what you put in that
[SPEAKER_00]: slide there, Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no growth happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I have traffic plus no growth,
I'm going to have less turf cover as we
[SPEAKER_00]: get close to the season that actually
actually matters, you know, in April and
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do worry about, OK, does there do we
get some weed encroachment there if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep out and we've got ball
marks early in the season on greens that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, are we going to get some poet
infestations there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think generally I probably worry most
about tea surfaces where there's divoting
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are definitely not growing that
grass back for another month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably that's where I'd say,
hey, like if you're going to open and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to try and make some money
like mats or just put the teas off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us golfers do not care,
especially public golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying 20 bucks to play 18 holes in
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put me off in the rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll I can tee it up in the rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take divots in the rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just happy to be outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like try and keep them off the high value
tea surfaces and preserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd say if if I'm or at least
I'm a superintendent, I'm trying to argue
[SPEAKER_00]: for, hey, let make less work for me later
on in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's maybe one option I'd go
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I'd say, Frank,
is when we look at we get data from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pellucid that looks at capacity,
weather adjusted capacity for golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many rounds can you play in March,
April, May, June, July based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sunny out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it warm out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not raining?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we see the most variation,
especially in upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: is March, April, November, December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make you can get huge
increases in your potential play by 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds sometimes in March and April if you
get a nice March and April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you can really get ahead on
your revenue if you're an operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look 10, 20 years in the future
with climate change, we're going to extend
[SPEAKER_00]: those shoulders of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's going to be hard to not open,
especially public golf in those times,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where you can make a lot of
your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can you can get into the green as
opposed to the red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so let me throw a punch in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you listen to the podcast I did
with Stewart and Jim, where where Stewart
[SPEAKER_01]: says that golfers are more like bears than
squirrels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hibernate in the winter and come out
in the spring and want to play golf like
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had beautiful weather in the fall
and probably nobody was playing the way we
[SPEAKER_01]: normally expect them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why why don't you play golf in the fall,
Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's a great analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you're to tire yourself out in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's also this effect of
Masters starts in April for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the first time they'll watch
golf on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really get the itch to play them once
you're in September, October, November.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've played if you're a competitor
golfer, you played all your tournaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been with your buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably had enough of them after 20
or 30 rounds, to be honest, at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hang up the clubs,
take some time off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's a good point, too,
by by Stewart is maybe the the springtime
[SPEAKER_00]: is where you can really make hay and get
that momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so then let's talk about this in other
arenas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The long thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's leave it to the side because that's
such as assume you're looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sports fields are a different animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's think that same argument that
happens here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you see the clear
justification in our climate for synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get ourselves into these
pickles, how do you reconcile these issues
[SPEAKER_01]: where now we're seeing a growing concern?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something we're going to talk
about ad nauseam this year because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: front of mind for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, you know, presenting us big
challenges with the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people would say epidemic of
synthetic turf being laid down,
[SPEAKER_01]: much like ag land going to solar farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like in the case of synthetic
turf, maybe polluting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, Carl, we want the
kids out and about and playing on safe
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you reconcile sports fields in your
mind with with the pickle we're in now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, again, just like with golf,
there's you could argue both sides of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and that's, of course,
the world we live in nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you fall on how you feel about,
you know, natural grass synthetic at this
[SPEAKER_01]: time of year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's there's there's a big
difference spring versus fall sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our data for like a 10 year
average of the New York the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do we expect the grass to grow
based on an average temper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sixty seven is about where we want to be
in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to 50 percent growth
potential until middle of May on average,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the end of our division one
spring season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're playing from February through May
when we're getting basically no growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worry about those sports on natural
grass because they're going to we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting no growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be using the field at least
five times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can expect that field quality to
decline and the fluctuations in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry a lot more about the safety of
that field in the spring versus the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have our soccer teams both play on
natural grass, both on campus and their
[SPEAKER_00]: practice facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth potential stays high now in the
fall, basically almost until December.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can host.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hosted NCAA division games when it
snows in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up until then, the grass is still
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can support the traffic and we have
data on the firmness readings,
[SPEAKER_00]: traction, how long the ball rolls and how
much it bounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it maintains these these standards up
until the end of the season because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough of warmth and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking to you and I are in this
project now where we're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: school districts on trying to figure out
how to do synthetic and natural turf
[SPEAKER_01]: governance and stewardship and making
decisions and how they go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met with Tom Ferrara, the facility
director facility for the city of Syracuse
[SPEAKER_01]: School District, an absolutely incredible
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's quite a professional,
that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, he's in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said to him, listen, I think you need
three fields for every one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need three natural grass fields,
six, seven acres of grass for every
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic field you have just off the top
of my head where you know you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: trash them and you're going to need
recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd almost say, you know, if you have
three teams and one field, you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: need five, you know, one synthetic field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably need five fields,
three fields, five fields in the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: three fields in the summer with two rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end of the day, you're going to
need more land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, yeah, I don't have any
more land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm spending millions on stormwater
associated with the synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you in the sports turf
business, this used to be something that
[SPEAKER_01]: was relatively straightforward,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And natural grass was losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think synthetic turf is now coming under
question, but you start to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: constraints that made synthetic turf the
best option, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban areas, Frank, and we've seen it in
New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get rid of synthetic turf in
the city and replace it with natural
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have millions of people and
probably hundreds of thousands of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who want to play sports and a confined
area, that's just not going to probably
[SPEAKER_00]: happen with one natural field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we know it's baseball and we're
going to be, the Yanks are off today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the hell they take a
Friday off and then they're playing
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nevertheless, I got to go one day
without baseball.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very happy to see Juan Soto strike
out and lose the game last night for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was very happy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the baseball world, Carl,
you know, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We showed Greg knows what he's doing,
taking care of that dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how many school districts have anybody
that has the, never mind even if they have
[SPEAKER_01]: the expertise, have the time to tend to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another reason where you see
synthetic turf having its benefits and
[SPEAKER_01]: options in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, I think I've said it on
this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave me one synthetic field I could
have, I'd put a baseball field in because
[SPEAKER_01]: most of these guys don't have the ability
like Greg does or the expertise,
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity to do the infield the way it can
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, that's a danger, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this safety thing from a broader
environmental perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the safety from a
projected net dial being hit at you at the
[SPEAKER_01]: exit V lo now that we pay attention to
that stupid statistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said yesterday, it's not how fast
it's how many.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not how fast it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how many go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this analytic stuff is over,
over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got any questions before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out Greg is on with
us today and he said he limits play in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so no cleats, sneakers only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard said the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, and that's a great example of
someone who knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you want to get out here,
we have to limit the damage we're doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: the turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says he does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's still closed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it until it's not safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to go use that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carl, we're at the,
we're at the end brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minutes gone by.
[SPEAKER_00]: First goes, the first episode always goes
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week we'll have Art Degayetano on the
real weather guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real weather guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk a little bit about sort of the
fall and, and some of the trends we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing with non, you know, how the snow
fell and growing degree days and also soil
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and model stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, Carl's actively, you're building a lot
of models, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and art is certainly art and Ben are
certainly the brains for, for you and me,
[SPEAKER_01]: more me than you, you got the brains,
but nevertheless, we'll see everybody next
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
