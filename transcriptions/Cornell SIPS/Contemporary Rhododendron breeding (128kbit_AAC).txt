[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's such a nice spring day out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to reward you for staying
inside with me with some beautiful spring
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about a rhododendron
project that I've been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long term project,
but that's woody plants for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title is just meant to convey my
effort to really rejuvenate a plant which
[SPEAKER_00]: has been popular for a long time in
gardens, but has sort of languished in
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce and sort of has lost popularity
in the public imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for lack of aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredibly beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every new variety that comes out seems
more stunning than the one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficulty, the problem really lies
with the culture of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to grow unless you're
a knowledgeable gardener that's willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the effort to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for really the vast majority of the
gardening public, these are plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: fail in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them, in our cynical moments,
biennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy them in bloom at the garden
center, and they die the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our research department at Holden is
consists of four principal investigators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why this big investment in
rhododendrons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, part of that is because of really
its happenstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a convergence of like-minded people
with the same interests able to pool their
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and create what became the David
G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leach Research Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So David Leach was a influential American
horticulturist, president of the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhododendron Society for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved heavily with the garden
conservancy, but also a passionate admirer
[SPEAKER_00]: of rhododendrons and a world authority,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote his seminal book called
Rhododendrons of the World, which really
[SPEAKER_00]: came out in the early 60s, really helped
popularize the plant in the American
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his niche as a hybridizer was cold
hardy hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his target for hardiness was zone five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in ornamental plants, the hardiness is
usually given for the buds, the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trait of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buds hardy to about minus 15 Fahrenheit
was his threshold level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he created these beautiful hybrids
here, the red sea and the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: capistrano, which are plants, they're
recombinant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find those colors in a hardy
background in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're created by hybridizing different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other answer to why rhododendrons is
why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are probably one of the most
ornamental woody shrubs available in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the diversity of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are species, most of them from Asia,
showing the range of colors, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: except maybe a blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variety of types of inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremendous variability in leaf morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have low elevation tree species with
leaves that are three feet long up to tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little small-leaved alpine plants at about
18,000 feet in the Asian mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes we'll have these kind of fuzzy
undersides here, different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a suede type covering called
indumentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really know the function of it,
but it's highly ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've been showing you so far is
just a slice of the total genus
[SPEAKER_00]: rhododendron, which worldwide consists of
about 1,000 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes other subgenera such as
the deciduous azaleas and the evergreen
[SPEAKER_00]: azaleas and the small-leaved
rhododendrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subgenus hymenanthes, which is the focus
of my talk, are the non-scaly-leafed,
[SPEAKER_00]: largely rhododendrons, most of them
evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the center of diversity, center of
origin for this genus, is southwest China
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those solid and hatched areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas of extreme topographical relief,
which led to quite rapid speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then outward from that center you'll
find instances of other species into
[SPEAKER_00]: Korea, Japan, and Central Asia,
and Europe, and across the land bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: into North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple species in the
eastern mountains of North America that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very useful for breeding cold-hearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeders like David would typically
take a hardy North American species and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it with a more colorful but less
hardy Asian species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a rule, you can intercross quite
freely at the subgeneric level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's really no, you don't have
to go to extremes to try to, for these
[SPEAKER_00]: wide crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the offspring themselves are often
fertile, so hybridizers would just cross
[SPEAKER_00]: species with species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes some of the modern
varieties have as many as a dozen
[SPEAKER_00]: different species in their background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you don't find rhododendrons is in
these continental areas of Asia or the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S., such as Cleveland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the areas where, of extreme
heat and cold, rhododendrons like higher
[SPEAKER_00]: elevations in the mountains, or along
maritime climates, which are more buffered
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well briefly, the interest in
the west in rhododendrons really evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that crazy Victorian passion for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the initial collections coming
into the west were in England,
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by landed gentry who could fund
expeditions and in return they would get
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really from the get-go, the interest
was among hobbyists, enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has really continued into today's
where most of the breeders are just what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call backyard breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely an exception to the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the first hybrids were made in
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Earl of Carnivon created some of the
first rhododendron hybrids and he was the
[SPEAKER_00]: owner of, it was called Highcrest Castle,
which you know as Down Abbey, there you
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so 20, a century and a half
later, there are over 25,000 registered
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not uncommon in popular plants like roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The style of breeding was done as a
pedigree breeding, just like dogs and
[SPEAKER_00]: horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders had their favorite stud plants to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very limited trialing, most things were
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were introduced commercially based on
one plant at one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the emphasis really was on flowers
above all and less on performance and
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a problem in terms of
general public use of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly soil issues, the requirement
for acid soils, pH optimum around five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and very good drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that primarily has to do with
avoidance of root rot disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many rhododendrons that are planted
by gardeners who are not knowledgeable,
[SPEAKER_00]: buying them at big box stores and just
sticking them into the foundation next to
[SPEAKER_00]: their downspouts, involves improper site
selection and lack of proper soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment to try to overcome those
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really out of that 25,000 group of
names and hybrids, there's fewer than 20
[SPEAKER_00]: that are important commercially on a
national, have a national sales presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the so-called ironclad
rhododendrons, which were developed over a
[SPEAKER_00]: century ago in England, but have proven to
be very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my goal really is to try to expand
that ornamental palette and create really
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern ironclads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking a collection that David
Leach created, really a 50-year box body
[SPEAKER_00]: of work that he did that developed these
highly ornamental cold hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're adding traits like root rot
disease resistance and heat tolerance to
[SPEAKER_00]: those with a goal of getting a plant
product that people can grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also one, particularly with the addition
of heat tolerance that will broaden the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhododendrons typically fade out of
culture as you go south around the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason-Dixon line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you go south, the emphasis shifts
to evergreen and deciduous azaleas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhododendrons are not considered to be
particularly heat tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And disease resistance and heat tolerance
are not really coincidental traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our source of resistance that we're using
happens also to be quite heat tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel that there's probably a
functional relationship between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: A working hypothesis in the breeding
program is that disease resistance is
[SPEAKER_00]: important in warm climates because disease
pressure increases as you get warmer and
[SPEAKER_00]: wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the disease, root rot disease,
is caused, the main causal organism is
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora cinnamoni, which I will
sometimes refer to as a fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but truly it's not a true fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fungus-like, now classified in the
protistas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a soil pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it finds a susceptible host,
it colonizes right behind the root cap and
[SPEAKER_00]: then begins to grow through the root
system, eventually moving up to the crown
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this section here,
the necrotic regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, it's really disrupting the
vascular system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this wilt symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the classic indication in the
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's irreversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, the plant's as good as
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zoospores are the infectious agents,
shown here in the lower right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are motile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move a little bit around in the
soil and under wet conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the reasons why
drainage is so important as a disease
[SPEAKER_00]: avoidance mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, phytophthora is a problem for
rhododendrons and many other crops because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a global invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And few native plants, like many of our
rhododendrons, are resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on, we were looking for sources
of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started, there already was a
report done by pathologists at Ohio State
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mid-70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did another report in 2002
looking at more contemporary hybrids just
[SPEAKER_00]: to do screens and identify either
cultivars or species that would be useful
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 6% of the hybrids proved resistant
and 17% of the species out of these
[SPEAKER_00]: collective studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that number gets even smaller when you
look for plants that are not only
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant but also have some measure of
cold hardiness, which is another one of
[SPEAKER_00]: our key criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing resistant screens, these are done
in control greenhouse experiments where we
[SPEAKER_00]: culture the pathogen in the lab and then
make an inoculum and give it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're either doing these, like on the
left, we're doing inoculations of single
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're usually trying to
identify resistance level and specific
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes where we need a replicated
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we're looking at seedling populations,
breeding populations where we're screening
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically variable offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are done when the plants are at
about six months of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key metrics that we use are
disease root scores, root rot disease
[SPEAKER_00]: scores, which is a numerical visual
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on a scale of one to five,
so one is a healthy root, nice white fine
[SPEAKER_00]: roots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working up to a level of intermediate
level, which is three, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: necrotic fine roots plus some of these
coarse roots here are also damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use pruners to kind of cut and
inspect cross-section as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a destructive sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up into the crown rot area and finally
five, which is a dead plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important for a parent to be
resistant, but also for it to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: transmit that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance to offspring effectively,
and not all plants do this equally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on really a breeding value,
which in turn is a measure of
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resemblance that offspring have to
their parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a key thing in woody plants
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a high heritability value,
which is estimated on a scale of zero to
[SPEAKER_00]: one, because you want to make as much gain
as possible in one generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The generation time in woody plants can be
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can make good progress in one
generation, that's really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the parent scores on the scale
of one to five versus offspring on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at open pollinated
offspring of all these parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the heritability estimate,
which is narrow sense heritability,
[SPEAKER_00]: a measure of additive genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is 0.86, which is a satisfactorily high
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests that we can make pretty good
gains in one breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that value comes in line with some
heritability studies done on other woody
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly these are all threatened tree
species from areas where phytophthora is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually naturalized and is becoming an
ecological issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eucalyptus, Monterey pine, European
chestnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the values there vary from 0.5 up to
about 0.86.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any similar data about prunus
root stocks in these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prunus, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, through some trial and error,
we settled on one species as our
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for resistance breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called rhododendron hyperethrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's native to Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But its high enough elevation is found
between 1,000 and 2,000 meters in the
[SPEAKER_00]: central mountains of Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has some hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a zone six plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow it outside in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did survive this winter, but it took a
pretty hard hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But its other virtue is heat tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the few largely
evergreen species that will grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gulf South.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to those traits, it has good
ornamental traits, this compact bushy
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, glossy foliage, nice thick leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very floriferous, although it
only comes in white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inflorescences, or trusses as
gardeners call them, are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the standard is for something a
little more compact and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a previous perspective,
what we're we're crossing this with plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know have hardiness, have good
saturated colors, pinks, reds,
[SPEAKER_00]: yellows, purples, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in breeding experiments, and again,
these are inoculated greenhouse studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: this just gives you a visual idea of what
comes out of a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a susceptible cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most of the parents we're
crossing it with are susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a variety called cal sap open
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's about 100% mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is seven weeks after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross with the species, no mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the F1 shown here, there's a little,
there are a few dead seedlings,
[SPEAKER_00]: but otherwise things look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a strong resemblance of the
first generation to the resistant parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can quantify that just by doing
disease progress plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using another susceptible variety,
yellow one called capistrano.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mortality rate on the Y over
days from inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the open pollinated offspring
from capistrano, a fast trajectory to
[SPEAKER_00]: extinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: R is the hyperethanol resistant parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it levels off at about 20% mortality
among those seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be some recombination where
about 20% of the offspring are susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the F1 plotted here, which levels
off and attracts closely to the resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You measure the area under the disease
progress curves and just subtract and
[SPEAKER_00]: divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can end up with a gain of,
in this case, 83% gain and resistance in
[SPEAKER_00]: one generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with some of those breeding experiments
behind us, we set off to generate large
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers of populations and progeny in
earnest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives an idea of how we made
those crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bulked different hyperethanogenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to use just one accession
because we wanted to avoid the possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of inbreeding depression in later
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd cross those with an array of
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this is the red group of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for strong pinks or reds out
of this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used yellow, purple, whites,
so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew those out in quantities with
the thought that we could possibly make
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that first generation material
might be worthy of introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then to take that to the F2 generation
through sib mating strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: either full or half sib.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the crosses were made in
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, we had them growing out in field
rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have kind of the same look,
pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the open sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see flower buds on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: By year four, most of them had produced
flowers to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they were spending the
winter outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were getting a performance and an
ornamental evaluation within four years by
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it shows you some of the
selections we made out of those thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: based on ornamental value and performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were reasonably satisfied since one
of the parents was white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were happy with what we were seeing
in terms of color saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, too, you get this nice
patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardeners call them blotches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, bees know them as
pollination guides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are any of those that we're seeing now
named cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this list, actually, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will finish up with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, in fact, I'm going to peel off from
the breeding program at this point and
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it up at the end of the talk and
detour a bit on some stress testing we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been talking so far really about
transferring resistance genes to progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in pathology, the operating principle
is called the disease triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many of you have probably been
introduced to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the disease symptoms we see in outdoor
conditions is really the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: between the host plant the pathogen and
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the environment can have a huge effect
on moderating the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, stress, environmental
conditions reduce resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phenomena that's called
predisposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at abiotic stresses like
extremes of moisture or temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity, ozone, those are all things that
can somehow change host physiology in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that weakens its defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, I was interested in
looking at flooding and heat, because
[SPEAKER_00]: those are two traits that deal immediately
with our desire to move these plants south
[SPEAKER_00]: and also with really the heavy kind of
substandard soil conditions you find in
[SPEAKER_00]: most landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2011, we conducted a field flooding
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put out an array of genotypes,
some unknowns, as well as some controls,
[SPEAKER_00]: both susceptible and resistant checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was an area where we suspected
the pathogen was present in our fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea initially was to flood the area
by pumping in water from our pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turned out to be the wettest year
on record in Northeast Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mother Nature took over our treatment
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had conditions like shown there on
the left repeatedly throughout the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably on seven or eight occasions,
where we would flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the course of a day or two,
it would drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the end of one season, then there
were clear, you know, most things were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking pretty bad, from outright dead to
oftentimes a chlorosis is a sign of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, of root rot damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what really stood out was how well
hyperethylene performed under those
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that's shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did it, so we harvested all
these dead plants, got root scores of
[SPEAKER_00]: five, and then we harvested the survivors
and calculated the values for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had groups of susceptible plants,
resistant benchmarks, three of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant plants that don't have
hyperethylene in them, some experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids with unknown resistance levels,
and then the species itself at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left here, this column,
shows disease scores under non-flooded
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were determined in previous
experiments before the field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, our resistant group here and
here had values of about two, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent to just damage to fine roots,
but nothing further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under flooded conditions, some clear
changes occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was more susceptible under
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in particular, the resistant
benchmarks almost doubled from their root
[SPEAKER_00]: scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's equivalent to going from just
having fine root damage to damage up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the crown region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants were nearly dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, hyperethylene, although the
values went up in root scores,
[SPEAKER_00]: only about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hybrids of hyperethylene did quite
well overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't significantly different from
the parent species in terms of root score
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're attributing these
results not to flooding stress directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hypoxia isn't a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it doesn't lead to plant
mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rodents can handle about 48 hours of
flooding with no issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the plants, really, the sequence of
mortality in the field really followed our
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations based on our benchmarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the susceptible plants died right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistant plants held on longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to kind of close out that
question, we also isolated phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: from necrotic regions of the field plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's done by, in this case,
we took, I think, pieces of stem near the
[SPEAKER_00]: crown region, grew them out on
semi-selective media, which will screen
[SPEAKER_00]: for phytophthoras, but not at the genus
level, but not at the species level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora cinnamoni, though,
does have kind of an unusual morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coral-like or coralloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another indication of a
potential match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we had those samples
sent to Ohio State, and they did a
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence analysis against the,
there's a diagnostic storage protein in
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora cinnamoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the match was 96 to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're fairly certain that that really
flood, the phytophthora was causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms and that it was, that some of the
effects we were seeing were aided and
[SPEAKER_00]: abetted by the flooding treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusions from the flooding
trials, that it's less predisposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: disease than other resistant
rhododendrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trait's heritable because the F1s did
almost add, statistically, they did as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the resistant parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is good in the sense that,
in terms of a product development,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we could potentially develop
rhododendrons that can withstand those
[SPEAKER_00]: poor soils, heavy soils found around,
in home landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another key question,
being that are these plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to warm climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hyperethanol, less predisposed to
disease under high temperature stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do these kinds of experiments,
we chose a pulse treatment method where
[SPEAKER_00]: you could expose tissue, in this case,
roots to heat, remove that stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: then inoculate it and include
un-inoculated controls, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently measure the level of
resistance in those treated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use large water baths, such as this
one here, to apply heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow either single plants or seedlings
in pots, and then drop those pots into a
[SPEAKER_00]: poly bag and immerse it in the water bath
for treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our treatment temperatures range from
a room temperature up to about 42 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, an experiment was done one
hour, two target in the bath, and then one
[SPEAKER_00]: hour at the target temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some data we just got this
winter, comparing Asian species for the
[SPEAKER_00]: response to heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have summary means for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't not run the stats yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we have red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are root rot scores plotted
against days after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're comparing on the bars the
controls with or without heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with or without heat,
plus phytophthora being the green bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dark green is the heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing to point out in the controls
is that there's no lethal effect of this
[SPEAKER_00]: heat stress on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, this is a species from
Central Asia called Ponicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a susceptible plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we reached almost complete mortality
within a week and a half of inoculation in
[SPEAKER_00]: both the non-stress and the heat
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No surprises there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hard to make a very
susceptible plant more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, though, we looked at two
Asian species that are resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: one from Japan called Kiskei, which is not
considered to be heat tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our heat tolerant, hyperethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those cases, the heat stress and
Kiskei, the dark green, clearly elevated
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease scores, especially in the
early part of the time course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't have a test yet on
significance, but it looks like it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hyperethanol, except for the very
first sampling date, which could be
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling air, all subsequent dates,
the heat stress on plants showed the same
[SPEAKER_00]: as or lower root scores than the
non-stress one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed to suggest that hyperethanol
is not predisposed to disease by higher
[SPEAKER_00]: soil temperatures, much in the way that it
was less predisposed by flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are good two attributes in
addition to resistance per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study was more of a study that was
more ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know whether natural
populations are warm, adapted ecotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: more disease tolerant following heat
stress than their cold tolerant relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And due to this, we switched to a species
called rhododendron minus, which is native
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Eastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows from high elevation in North
Carolina down to within 50 miles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gulf Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Florida Panhandle and Southern
Alabama, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been collecting those over the
years, putting together, trying to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: the really a range wide collection of the
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have compared two populations so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one here at elevation 4,000 feet in
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one at low elevation in Southern
Georgia called Providence Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the shrub here at the top of
Hawksbill Mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd find the rhododendron minus at
the bottom of this canyon along the river
[SPEAKER_00]: bed in Providence Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the same kinds of disease
progress plots, same kind of heat
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments that I described earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures were a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you results at 26 and at 42
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did them at 34 and 50 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the mortality rates over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 26 degrees, and the blue is the
Northern high elevation population and the
[SPEAKER_00]: red is the Southern low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the controls down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat treated, but not inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's no, heat treatment
appears to be sublethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 26, they're basically the same,
statistically the same response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both species are highly susceptible to
phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you know, mortality within,
almost complete within under two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: from inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would expect that in the case of a
natural population that's being challenged
[SPEAKER_00]: with an invasive pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 42 Celsius, there's a high degree of
mortality and ultimately in both
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, but the rate of disease
development or mortality in the Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: population is much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at areas under the curve here,
that turns out to be a statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a transient effect anyway,
the heat stress appears to be initiating
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of defense response in the warm
climate ecotypes that's not found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, I thought was a fairly novel
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to see if we can generalize
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those data are looking at a larger sample
of populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still the question of root damage is
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's sublethal, but you don't
know if there is some, something going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 42 Celsius, that's pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, and that could confound the
interpretation of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some viability assays on both
populations using TTC staining,
[SPEAKER_00]: a vital stain that will turn cells pink as
it's reduced by mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can elute that stain and measure
it spectrophotometer, with a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrophotometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're showing absorbance,
standardized over dry weight, milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: dry weight for both Southern low,
Northern high populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no significant difference in
viability estimated that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel that within that 26 to 42
Celsius window, root viability is not an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good range of temperatures to
continue working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 50 Celsius, I mentioned we had done a
screen there and there actually was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 50% loss of viability in those
tissues, a bit too extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't really understand the
rhododendrons, what's going on at the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological level, but there are
reports, there's increasingly reports from
[SPEAKER_00]: other systems, notably Arabidopsis and
Tomato, of how predisposition might
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really involves sort of
antagonistic metabolisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start with a resistant plant,
given it an abiotic stress that kicks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hormone abscisic acid, which is
commonly, it's a very common upregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: stress related hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ABA, increased ABA can cause a
inhibition of defense signaling pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: that are specifically those mediated by
jasmonic acid or salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is then a pathogen challenge
during or subsequent to that stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the defense system of the plant is
lowered and you can change phenotypes from
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a consensus model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly lots of variations on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I feel from my work, since we've
identified genotypes that are less
[SPEAKER_00]: predisposed, that clearly there's probably
involved some different regulation at the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the advent of less expensive
genomic analysis, metabolomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparative transcriptome analysis,
these would be perhaps fruitful studies
[SPEAKER_00]: for the future, if you were predisposed to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, finally back to the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Program, since we wanted to develop heat
tolerant rhododendrons, the obvious thing
[SPEAKER_00]: was to put them in the South and see how
they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this work, we found a industry partner
with plant development services based in
[SPEAKER_00]: near Mobile, Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a brand called Southern Living
Plant Collection, which is quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And PDSI really, they're not a nursery per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work between breeders like me and the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take care of the development aspects
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are services that we don't have
in-house at Holden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the test site was in Southern
Louisiana, Independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had put in over 165 selections that we
made in Madison initially, and put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were shaded, I think,
for the first half of the first summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and subsequently have been out in the
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is now the beginning of year
three of the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get fairly strong afternoon sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the results so far,
there are really about 20% or maybe 30 out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 165 selections that we put in have
really performed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where we're at 100% survivorship,
and the surviving plants themselves are
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good leaf quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're producing good flowers,
such as the one shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this past March, I was down there
while they were in bloom, the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been there in bloom, and we selected
three for introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two pinks, one kind of a clear pink,
the other more of a rose pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these patterns, these flares and
blotches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a frilled margin to the
petal, as does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another nice feature where the
petals, the backs of the petals will be
[SPEAKER_00]: darkly pigmented, and the face will be
lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that creates kind of a bi-color effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little nuances do make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plant fancier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that these can compete with
what's already kind of been established as
[SPEAKER_00]: the current standard for rhododendrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in the South, they will
have no competition because there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: rhododendrons yet that have been
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these will go into tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one already is, and then subsequently
out to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can glean some extra information from
that field trial by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to confirm the presence of
phytophthora, just as we did in Madison,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio, by isolating and sequencing the
pathogen, just to prove that that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an old nursery site, and they
apparently grew a lot of azaleas and
[SPEAKER_00]: camellias there, and those are both hosts
for phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because nurseries are constantly
moving plants in and out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory, and phytophthora travels in
soil, it's quite likely that it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the symptoms are consistent with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would be good to go back and
look at both the top and bottom classes of
[SPEAKER_00]: performers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the original mother plants still
in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can go back to them and do tests for
resistance under controlled conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: confirm that they are respectively
resistant or susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will really close the circle on
this notion that disease resistance is a
[SPEAKER_00]: key trait to surviving in a warm climate
like that, with high disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: While at Holden, we always talk about
being about more than just a pretty plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're a serious institution on a
serious mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the scope of my project is
fairly narrow, I've tried to move it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: direction that's topical, that addresses
the issues that knowledgeable scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: are concerned about in these days and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the issue of sustainability is
addressed because resistance will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: result in reduced pesticide use,
typically fungicide drenches that are used
[SPEAKER_00]: in nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are broadly adaptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my goal of covering zones five to
nine has probably been modified by the
[SPEAKER_00]: past two winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we will release these marketed
to zone six to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although many zone five winners,
it will do fine, just as it has done well
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ohio up until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call them climate change ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly they're positioned for global
warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And warming's not just an issue in terms
of stress on plants, but most predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: state that disease pressure will also
increase under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an increased chance with
warmer climates that pathogens like
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora could naturalize in our
northern forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, it's a good example of a
solution-based use of biodiversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing how we can tap a species like
hyperethanol in this room to address a
[SPEAKER_00]: real stubborn problematic issue like root
rot disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I'd just like to thank some of my
staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jing Wang is a research associate who
works year-round with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hilary Wright has been a seasonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our volunteers, Susan Hanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my collaboration with PDSI is through
Buddy Lee, shown here on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's the Director of Plant Innovations
for PDSI, and also an accomplished
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental breeder in his own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, a few sources of funding,
not to mention my major underwriter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Holden Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can turn the lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned you guys are going to
attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genotypes of hyperethanol are used to
prevent increase in depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were those selected for superior
performance in terms of disease resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: from a broader group?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there is some structure,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any hyperethanol plants when
I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't in our collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an outfit on the west coast
called the Third End of Species
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a pretty good world collection,
including several hyperethanol plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made some process of those
excessions, their excessions, in 70C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I screened that for resistance
and took out the survivors that were
[SPEAKER_01]: really close to the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know about their flower
attributes, the time we selected those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these are, but there are some
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some seem to have larger flowers,
but maybe more of a substance appeal than
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do any of the new varieties have a more
ornamentally interesting group?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not really known for showing
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're green and turning brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask if you have any idea
what the resistance is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's polygenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably multilinear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should evolve phytoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that there's an age-response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't show that on the,
we discussed it on the heredity plot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the offspring scores were the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had shifted up in value, so they were
more susceptible to parents as a group,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were measuring six-month-old
offspring versus physiologically mature
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you name your new varieties,
how are we going to know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a lot of it, maybe someone out of
my hands, I think PSI will probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: their own ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really, they're the
marketeers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do a lot of that, and maybe they
have a sense of what to maintain sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't quite got to that point of
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we sort of have another, we sort of do
what I call leech classic items that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sticking to a golden front of those,
golden solar flare and so forth like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't know those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those wouldn't be for the South.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be one of the traditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I want to thank you,
Steve, for traveling to Ithaca and sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: your research with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
