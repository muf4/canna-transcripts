[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matt Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an assistant professor of sustainable
cropping systems at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk with you about two
strategies that I'm working on,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop interseeding and perennial
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really talking about keeping the
soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a key strategy for improving soil
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just some issues that I'd like to
bring up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual grain crop production often
degrades soil health, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using soil tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cover crops can help offset
this degradation and improve soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not widely adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New York, based on 2014 data,
we're about at 10% adoption of cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: across all the cropland in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solution here is cover crop
interseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you saw a similar picture earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cover crop that was drilling
interseeded into between rows of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really exciting about this is
that people have been interseeding cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been aerial seeding, broadcast
seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new piece of equipment that
actually drills the seed, improves the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to soil context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a small slit, and it deposits
the seed right into the soil surface
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cover crop mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of interest and excitement
about cover crop mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so traditionally in New York,
when we were cover cropping, we would
[SPEAKER_00]: typically be limited to cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal rye is a great cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a standby cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used by thousands and thousands
of farmers for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's limited in the functions that it
provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for cycling nutrients and using
it as a catch crop to prevent nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's about all it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a lot of biomass if you let it
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're seeing here with cover
crop interseeding is that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: get legumes established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these legumes, when you get these
legumes established in other species that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would typically not be able to seed
after cover crops or after cash crops are
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested in the fall, it can really
change the whole sustainability of your
[SPEAKER_00]: system and increase soil health
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we survey farmers and we talk with
farmers, they say that not being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, their number one reason why they
do not grow cover crops is because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have enough time after crop harvest
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing this, you can get that cover
crop established on time and actually grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these different species and integrate them
into your cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very exciting research going on at
Cornell and across the US with cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: interseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now starting to see that they do
have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing a fairly rapid response in
terms of soil improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a recent paper that came out was
showing that after just four years with
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop interseeding, we're starting to
see indicators, improved indicators of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over a very short period of time,
we're not necessarily increasing soil
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, but we're starting to see these
indicators like improved soil respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased aggregate stability,
increased active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These levels are going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very exciting research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other strategy that I'd like to talk
about is perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the grains that we eat now,
they're annual crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we till and we replant them every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is develop
perennial grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are crops that you would plant once
and then harvest for multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an illustration here just
showing what you would typically see on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left with an annual crop production on
sloped land where you have some runoff and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creating some erosion and water
quality challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: By keeping the soil covered with a
perennial crop, for multiple years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're thinking that we can improve water
infiltration, increase soil health and get
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that water going into the soil,
less of it running off and causing erosion
[SPEAKER_00]: and water quality problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New York state, we're working with a
number of farmers, four organic farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular that we're working with very
closely, growing some different perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is called curnza.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a perennial grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some seed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small seed and this is a crop
that is domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with partners at the Land
Institute in Kansas, also in France and
[SPEAKER_00]: across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this crop, again, it's different than
all of your other grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new and so we've taken out a wild
plant and have domesticated it and through
[SPEAKER_00]: recurrent selection, have selected for
increased seed size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's really exciting about this
is that right now we're at a tipping point
[SPEAKER_00]: with perennial grain production where
we're seeing large companies become
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in curnza for increasing their
sustainability of their operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one company is Patagonia Provisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Patagonia, the clothing company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've started a food line and they've
started to offer a beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called long root ale that's grown or
made with curnza.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 15% curnza in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now General Mills through Cascadian
Farms is very interested in integrating
[SPEAKER_00]: curnza into their product lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a new cereal that will be coming
out this October that has curnza in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really exciting stuff happening
right now in New York with our farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're into our second year of harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, yields are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having some challenges with
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new crop unlike all the other
annual grains that are completely dry when
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is still a bit green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually getting through the combine
and working out some of these logistical
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges, mechanical problems is what
we're focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also very interested in developing
agronomic recommendations, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out when you should seed this,
what your seeding rate should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your fertility management should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all part of this research that
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the far right there,
this is a picture of the root of this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left here, over here,
this is the perennial grain curnza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has that extensive root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the reasons why it's,
in addition to keeping the soil covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another reason why we think that it
can have a major impact and improve soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I think this is an up and
coming crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still more work to be done,
but keep an eye out for this and happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk more about this if we have time
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
