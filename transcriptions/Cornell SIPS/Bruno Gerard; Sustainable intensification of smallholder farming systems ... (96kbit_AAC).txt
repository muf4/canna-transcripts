[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here for many
reasons because Andy is a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very good friend and I missed him when he
left CIMIT for Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a bit upset about Cornell,
of course, but I think it's also because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know Cornell for a long time and that's my
first visit ever, so I think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Cornell by reputation, by its good
reputation, by the publications and by
[SPEAKER_01]: many colleagues who graduated from Cornell
and we've worked in the CG or still
[SPEAKER_01]: working in the CG system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many thanks to be so numerous here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I give a seminar in CIMIT,
you have usually smaller rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will try to give you an overview of the
work we do in CIMIT through the lens of
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a presentation I made for the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a board of trustees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to know a bit more about
our programs and they usually want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something on mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say not again mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this presentation is not about
mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lens of mechanization and system
identification through the lens of
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I start, I have a couple of slides
about the CGIR research centers and how
[SPEAKER_01]: many of you heard about the CG?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't need to explain very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CG was created at the end of the
60s, beginning of the 70s as a body of
[SPEAKER_01]: centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think initially there were just few
centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: CIMIT is one of the oldest ones and we
just celebrated our 50th anniversary not
[SPEAKER_01]: so long ago, two years ago, with the
mandate to look at research for
[SPEAKER_01]: development or research in development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CG was created with now we have
about 15 centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of changes that will happen in the
next two years and I don't want to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: that because it's still a big
interrogation mark, how the CG will be
[SPEAKER_01]: shaped in two years time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was created just to cover most of
the developing countries, both in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: geographies and also in terms of
thematics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CIMIT is the center working on maize
and wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known as International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do much more than breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still very well known by a breeding
component, but we do much more than
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are also worried about the CRP,
the CGIR Research Programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much less, it's not as popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the last reform of the CG that
was about eight years, eight, nine years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So research programs were created and
there are about 15 research programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are leading two research programs,
one on maize, one on wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also leading a platform,
which is something a bit different in the
[SPEAKER_01]: program and newer, the excellence in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are part of the agriculture for
nutrition and health led by IFPRI and also
[SPEAKER_01]: by the, to the CCAF, the climate change
CRP, which is led by SEAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also contributing to the big data
platform, to the gene bank platform and to
[SPEAKER_01]: the PIM, the policy institutions and
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, those efforts are made for us to
work better together as a body of centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to systematic
intensification through the lens of
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that my presentation to the
board would be boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really got excited the more I
thought about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more I developed my slides,
I thought, well, that's a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise just to take something as,
you know, narrow as mechanization and just
[SPEAKER_01]: look at its impact in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the key messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are probably the, by far the center,
having the largest portfolio on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: IFPRI has worked a bit on mechanization,
but mostly on the, on the policy issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, we submit us offices
in several countries and we are covering
[SPEAKER_01]: our regions as Latin America, but mainly
in Mexico, but also Sub-Saharan Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly Eastern and Southern Africa,
and then South Asia where we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest portfolio in our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's thanks to Andy who developed
that portfolio in a very efficient manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a long history, especially in
South Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Peter Hobbs is maybe here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter, are you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's one of the pioneer was
involved in conservation agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: in mechanization work, because I mean,
those two are very much linked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the, the challenge of
conservation agriculture is linked to
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a previous to the CRP,
there was several ecoregional programs and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Rice Weed Consortium was one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was very efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I joined CIMIT after that,
that program, that consortium was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was closed, but I think it was very,
very efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the, that was the foundation
for our work in South Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we work with IFPRI and IRRI there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IRRI, the Rice Research Institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our work on mechanization is broader
than engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a systemic approach to
mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we don't have many engineers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a strong potential contribution of
mechanization to sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: intensification in small farming systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contribution of mechanization to
social inclusion is also very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I show a few slides about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effective ways to scale mechanization
is to public-private partnership,
[SPEAKER_01]: commerce, commercialization, creation of
business opportunity for service
[SPEAKER_01]: provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a few slides about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just don't want to be in search.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have research at the end with
an impact on the ground, on the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: number of smaller farmers possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a strong policy dimension and I
will just show you also a few slides
[SPEAKER_01]: linked to the policy dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do we work on mechanization?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a large flagship program in Mexico
called Masagro and we have a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization component there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with ICADA, which is another CG
center in Northern Africa on rain-fed
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat systems and the wheat CRP
initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work in East and Southern Africa and we
have different funding there with good
[SPEAKER_01]: funding from the Australian ACIR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the FACACI project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are funded by the Germans as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some interest in mechanization,
that's GIZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are linking with FAO on a project
in Zambia funded by the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the largest in our program,
the largest portfolio is in South Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 50% of our funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we work under the CISA
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a series of projects all connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the wheat CRP and also under the
Borlok Institute for South Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a structure that was created by
CBIK to work in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, Australian funding on the
surface area projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a diversity of geographies
where we work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different biophysical but also some
socioeconomic environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: CG centers are supposed to work above the
national level or the local level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the richness of what we do and
that's probably what we can bring to
[SPEAKER_01]: national programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we work a lot with national
research programs and development
[SPEAKER_01]: structure in countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine that's three
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is a very, very large field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is a very fragmented
landscape in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is a landscape in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second one is mostly rice based
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in Kenya is mostly maize based
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine that with such a
diversity in field size, mechanization
[SPEAKER_01]: solution might be quite different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opportunities and constraints to adoption
of mechanization can be quite different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to find scale appropriate tools
to work on the different landscape is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the objectives of our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was large efforts in pushing
mechanization in the 70s, 80s in Africa
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was a major failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I worked in Niger in the
early 90s, I think the average lifespan of
[SPEAKER_01]: a tractor was below 100 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just state schemes that was
funded mostly by the World Bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a complete failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a moment, I mean, the thing is that
in the work we do, sometimes people judge,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't look at why it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't look at it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had about, in Africa about eight,
nine years ago, we wanted just to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for mechanization because we
could see that the adoption of
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization in South Asia for smaller
farming systems was something very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So large scale mechanization and
conservation agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: One good thing about conservation
agriculture is that you don't need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: primary tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you can work with less
horsepower than smaller tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big, big advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also looking at mechanization with the
minimum negative social and environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in term of the need for land
consolidation, if you have large
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization schemes or the labor
displacement and the soil degradation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a major focus of our research as
well and our focus on conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture in our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So machines should adapt to farm size and
not the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it seems quite obvious,
but sometimes you still see schemes in
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa where people are coming with large
tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to John Dee a few years ago and
close to Chicago and today at Coors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't like what I was presenting
because their business is to sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest tractor possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't like conservation
agriculture very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the context of sustainable
intensification, we will look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of mechanization on different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most obvious one is labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a major limiting factor to
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are key times in cropping
systems or farming systems where labor is
[SPEAKER_01]: really missing and have a negative impact
on yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see two of the publications
from our group related to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can give the list of publications
I've cited.
[SPEAKER_01]: The presentation can be circulated as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing secret there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crop establishment is the most critical
time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's valid also in South Asia and
irrigated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only water, but what you can
see there, it's a seven day difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have maize on the left side,
maize on the right side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven days delay can have a dramatic
effect on yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that cloud of points and
that's for South Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So delay in sowing dates and impact on
wheat yield in VR.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason there is not like in rain fed
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like the terminal heat stress
you can have on the wheat if you plant too
[SPEAKER_01]: late.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wheat in the endogangetic plains,
there are two seasons, the cold season and
[SPEAKER_01]: the monsoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wheat is grown during the cold season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the wheat cycle,
temperature is increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have terminal heat stress and
having a large impact on wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crop establishment is also very
demanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the work that's done here
in Ethiopia with a pair of oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's classical tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the amount of soil
movement done by those ladies in East
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that's important in
mechanization, planting, seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the challenge with the
equipment for under conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and mulch is to go through the
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the work we do is trying
to find the best or develop the best
[SPEAKER_01]: planters that can go through the amount of
crop residue left on the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have four wheel tractor solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two wheel tractor solutions
depending on the area where we work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the work on mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the labor measures done in East
Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the conventional
establishment is requiring quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mechanized CA is just much,
much reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a major impact on labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that you don't have to work
two or three weeks to establish all your
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can work much faster and then you have
an impact on yield as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all the different operations and
the classical time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's taking the most time is the
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the manual and you have the
mechanized options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanization and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is also an important input in all
the farming systems where we work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Major impact has been done on working on
laser land leveling in India over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter, when did that start?
[SPEAKER_04]: I started in Pakistan probably in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, a cement, we didn't create
the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laser land leveling was existing and was
used in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: quite intensively in places like Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we worked with national partners and
we developed schemes for laser land
[SPEAKER_01]: leveling, having a major impact on water
management in those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think right now in India,
I think there's about six million acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: laser land level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, time to time you need to
re-level your field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a good business around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working more on technology of
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we are just developing some,
doing some research on subsurface drip
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation and we get fantastic water use
efficiencies under those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus the option of control much better,
the fertilizer inputs through fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The slide on the bottom left is about
actual flow pumps that can be paired with
[SPEAKER_01]: the PTO of a two wheel tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that if you don't have too
much, of course, that's suction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your lift cannot be that large.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Bangladesh, you can usually find
open water and bring it to your fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also a very interesting option
for farmers for supplemental irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have mechanized also, and that's a
prototype that's been developed at the
[SPEAKER_01]: DISA station to lay down drip lines under
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing with minimum tillage or
reduced tillage or no tillage is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can put your lines down and you don't need
to remove them at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, if you don't have too much
rodents around, you can probably keep your
[SPEAKER_01]: lines through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So impact at scale, that's the figures I
was talking about on laser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laser leveling, so you have now 40,000
units in India and was mainly done through
[SPEAKER_01]: private investment and service provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can be a good model for developing
and scaling mechanization in other parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the world as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see all the figures just impact
on water management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water savings on yields, on employment,
on electricity savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the issue in India is that water is
subsidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, pumping is not costed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricity is subsidized for pumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of a problem when you want
to incentivize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that are free are just usually
abused.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are also some research that's
linking that to the policy component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanization and nutrient use,
plant nutrient use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mechanization is obviously improving
directly two of the four R principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right rate, I mean if you have
fertilizer application with your planter
[SPEAKER_01]: or your direct drill seeder, and the right
rate in the right place as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So place and rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you increase profitability and you
reduce also greenhouse gas emission and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate reaching, which is a major problem
in many systems where we work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social inclusion, those are data from our
project in Africa, in Eastern and Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shows over the year the access to
mechanization and we are just monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's very important now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our donors are not interested in
publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time they're interested in the
impact we can generate, either directly or
[SPEAKER_01]: indirectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of the monitoring we have
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanization in Africa, Sub-Saharan
Africa, is still a big, big challenge for
[SPEAKER_01]: many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to continue to work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the equity issue, who has access to
mechanization is also a very important
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at the investment costs
for a large structure and you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: investment costs for the animal traction
and two-wheel tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with animal traction is that
you usually use your animals for one,
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three weeks during the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest of the year you have to feed
those animals with property use and feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the issues of conservation
agriculture adoption in Africa is also the
[SPEAKER_01]: trade-off between crop residue use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going to a mechanized option,
a fully mechanized option, and not going
[SPEAKER_01]: through animal traction is probably much
more promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, I mean, animal traction might
look very romantic, but it's not the best
[SPEAKER_01]: use of resources in smaller farming
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the cost when you go from
conventional practices with four-wheel
[SPEAKER_01]: tractors to two-wheel tractors,
conservation agriculture, the cost is
[SPEAKER_01]: much, much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have again in the middle,
the cost of animal traction when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to take care of your animals between two
seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Youth, I mean, that was a big topic in the
CG a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we make agriculture attractive for
young people in developing countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have all the same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think agriculture is not very sexy in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very sexy in the US, but we have
a lot of consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In developing countries, in many places,
that's the only livelihood option for
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a lot of migrations to cities
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So population is often aging very,
very quickly in smaller systems in Asia
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example where you had a maize
sheller, which in one season generated
[SPEAKER_01]: $6,700, which from our standard might not
look very big, but it's very, very big in
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a large amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking also on those services
and service provision and how much,
[SPEAKER_01]: how long it takes to return, to have the
return on investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's quite short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gender impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very, very simple sheller again,
but it was a huge reduction in labor
[SPEAKER_01]: demand and budgetary for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from 12 days per ton to one hour
per ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the work in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we are monitoring and we are
looking at the impact of mechanization on
[SPEAKER_01]: different important livelihood components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Child care activities, cooking,
our farm labor, livestock poultry,
[SPEAKER_01]: income generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the time you're free on your operations
through mechanization, you can invest it
[SPEAKER_01]: in income generating activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arvesting, carrying, trashing,
help to manage farm laborers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time spent on leisure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, leisure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, life in small farms in developing
countries can be tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that's very,
very, I think, profitable for people as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's linked to the drudgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a strong gender dimension to
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually women work much more, many more
hours in rural landscapes in Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Asia than men.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time sleeping as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sleeping is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an interesting study showing just
the implication of one mechanization
[SPEAKER_01]: option, which is the reaper arbester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we scale that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the question is that in Asia,
it's already a large adoption of
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Africa, it's just at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at model to scale out
appropriate mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one key thing is service provision
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So professionalization of the activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, we don't dream about every farmer
having a small two wheel tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the service provision is much more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the classical adoption,
technology adoption curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that in Africa,
we are about there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in some places in Asia,
we are still, we are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the research questions are still very
interesting, even with adoption of scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very interesting aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to work under that adoption,
technology adoption continuum is also very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting for us and learning also from
what we do in Asia for the future in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the projects we have in
Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shows the growth since the
beginning of the project on machinery
[SPEAKER_01]: service provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's part of the monitoring
and evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a USAID.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a US funded project, USAID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very important that we document
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the achievement after the phase
one of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are now going into a phase two,
which is a bit different and has been
[SPEAKER_01]: redesigned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are not small numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are large numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we are pretty proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not a pure research institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are at the end working for impact on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of work has been done in
Bangladesh and in other places as well to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the best business models for
scaling mechanization, increasing adoption
[SPEAKER_01]: of mechanization options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have even a scaling specialist now
in CIMIT, we call it like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking among other things at
mechanization options in different
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a slide where you see my
favorite US president from the left side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy is Joe Oliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a kind of innovator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has gone on grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know him very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are trying to work with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's digital agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also options on service provision
through cell phones and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very exciting type of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls it the Uber 4 practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also a great tool to monitor
the work of equipment in the field and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indians have their own systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their own system, which is very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some manufacturers now that
are working on the scaling of monitoring
[SPEAKER_01]: systems and service provision and command
systems for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: FAO is a big player.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the new director general of FAO who
visited us before being elected.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was campaigning in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are discussing China is an
interesting country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's probably the country with the
largest number of manufacturers of two
[SPEAKER_01]: wheeled tractors, small implements,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great place to go and shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the business models we are looking at,
of course, looking at service provision,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you need to create the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to create import schemes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to train people in local
workshops to develop and or repair the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an FAO is well implemented in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working with the FAO in mechanization
makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information, knowledge, communication is
also very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have done quite interesting
videos, especially in South Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many videos do we have related to
mechanization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a few, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have briefs and we have a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capacity development and we are running
conservation agriculture training courses
[SPEAKER_01]: at least once a year in Mexico and once a
year in South Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also very important to enhance
capabilities in different countries where
[SPEAKER_01]: we work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was teased by the top management of
Simin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, you do interesting work in
mechanization and it's not visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes people don't see what they
don't want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have done specific efforts in trying
to brand our work also for different
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for people being interested by the
topic, from other research or development
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fundraising, I mean, we work only on
soft funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to raise money for the work we
want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's been a lot of tweets and
discussion while we are using Twitter,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are using Facebook, we are using
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One interesting aspect related to
mechanization is and you probably heard
[SPEAKER_01]: about the air pollution problem in
Northwest India in Delhi, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: only due to crop residue burning,
but crop residue burning is adding a layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of pollution at the time of rice
harvesting, which is in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rice residues are burned not just
because farmers like to burn things,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because they have to prepare the land
for the wheat, subsequent wheat crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the time is not that big and that's one
of the first I show the penalty,
[SPEAKER_01]: the yield penalty you have on the wheat by
delaying your wheat planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the easiest way to get rid of crop
residue is just to burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been looking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Peter, the first version of the
APC that was the low point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Australian funding initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is also that's the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, long term investment pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean some donors are getting very
impatient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They write a project in three years,
you have to have four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have impact at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work like that, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sustained investment and coherence in what
you do over the long term is very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just show you, that's a combine
arvester, harvesting the rice on the left
[SPEAKER_01]: side and directly planting the wheat just
after harvesting the rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the amount of residue you
have and how the api cedar is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can see there also that's added
to the combine arvester is a straw
[SPEAKER_01]: management system, which is spreading the
straw more evenly, that you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: piles of straw and that your cedar works
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another paper, interesting paper,
was trying to show, and that's more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: policy issue, showing the trade off that
you can have on different things in a
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the effect of, and I think that was in
2008, Andy, that the water act was taken,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact to save water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just delay the planting dates for the
authorized planting dates for rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, of course, had a major impact on
the way farmers had to manage their
[SPEAKER_01]: residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this paper is quite interesting because
it's showing, in fact, the difference that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have in term of crop residue burning
and air pollution before the water act and
[SPEAKER_01]: after the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Andy is one of the lead
author of that publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So health issues are taken seriously in
India as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you look in the news,
both national and international news,
[SPEAKER_01]: crop residue burning is a burning issue in
South Asia and especially in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could see that the quick scaling
of api cedars in two states of India,
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest India, Punjab and Haryana,
between 2010 to 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there were subsidies to
manufacturers and to service providers to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not always, without subsidies,
wouldn't have been possible because api
[SPEAKER_01]: cedar is quite an expensive piece of
equipment, and it's just used two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now what we are doing,
we are monitoring, and Andy is still
[SPEAKER_01]: working on those topics, we are
monitoring, in fact, the evolution of crop
[SPEAKER_01]: residue burning in that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way forward for us, I think we have
increased the visibility of our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, visibility is important if
we want to sustain and continue to have
[SPEAKER_01]: funding for that type of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scaling work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our role has been a knowledge
broker through systemic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not just narrowly looking at
engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to keep strong linkages between
mechanization and more sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a natural match if you look at
conservation, agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a natural match.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to enhance gender youth relevant
technical innovations in the scaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not only for field operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also post-harvest and transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to explore new regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have been discussing in West
Africa with Benin, who is the Minister of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strong interest from Rwanda as well to
have a mechanization program developed in
[SPEAKER_01]: that country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia, we are not very present in
Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are almost absent in Southeast Asia,
and we are looking at opportunities to
[SPEAKER_01]: work there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to develop also South-South
collaboration, China-Africa, India-Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: and public-private partnership approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: India has fantastic engineers in Punjab,
and I think it can really serve Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be win-win solutions,
options, in terms of business development,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of benefits for smaller farmers
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to keep our key collaboration
developed further with FAO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the GIZ mechanization platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now in the CG, we are reinventing
ourselves, and we are wondering whether we
[SPEAKER_01]: should have an initiative on mechanization
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not yet proposed, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could be something where I think
all CG centers would be interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: working on a systemic approach to
mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for your talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter had to leave a little bit early,
but he asked me to ask you, if you are a
[SPEAKER_03]: small folder without a lot of resources,
how do you actually gain access to some of
[SPEAKER_03]: this mechanization?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the actual procedure for being able
to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are places where there's no
access yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's developing business models,
which would involve probably financial
[SPEAKER_01]: schemes, would involve public and private
sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in India, it's flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Bangladesh, there's a lot of momentum
around that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Africa, we have to prime the pump,
because there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our research in the FACACI project
was more a discovery phase on
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanization options using two-wheel
tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have seen the figures in terms of
costs, timing, yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a no-brainer when you see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the challenge is to build an
ecosystem around mechanization in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because new research questions will emerge
when you start having adoption of those
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing is, and I didn't present it
here, but it's the targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the low-hanging fruits when it
comes to where to put mechanization,
[SPEAKER_01]: where to start it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to initiate that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not in the middle of the bush
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proximity to cities is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having farmers who are more aware of more
and eager to mechanize also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a range of criteria on where we
should start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are looking for government support
as well in doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not working alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with advanced research
institutions, but also with national
[SPEAKER_01]: research organizations, NGOs in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Bangladesh, we work quite a lot with
IDE.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not an easy option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's really context-specific
in how we can scale that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have impact at scale in
Africa yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the model more for farmers themselves
to mechanize, or is the model more for a
[SPEAKER_02]: custom, that is, a sector that provides
the mechanization?
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed the laser leveling,
which obviously has to be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also thinking of planting and
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in the United States, there's a lot
of custom plowing, custom harvesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: even with farmers with a lot of
possibility they could invest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead, it's more efficient for a
sector to arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where is your emphasis there or to
both models that you think would apply in
[SPEAKER_02]: different countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are for service provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most cases, those are farmers
becoming service providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we saw that in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No point in buying a large combined
harvester if you have 50 acres of wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most systems, it's like that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are trying to provide incentives and
knowledge for investment in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: service provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you saw the youth group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are rural youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just invested in the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will probably help in buying the
maize shelter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they paid it back very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's those type of things, positive
deviance in the way of working landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: will incentivize order.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need a critical mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you cannot just have one
mechanized service provider somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that guy will not be well-linked
to get equipment, will not be well-linked
[SPEAKER_01]: to get repairs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a full system that we need to
develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that learning from South
Asia, India, but also Bangladesh,
[SPEAKER_01]: where farms are much smaller than even in
Africa, can be very useful for developing
[SPEAKER_01]: schemes for Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you gave your example about the
livestock going away from the livestock,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that you have to pay them for the rest
of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what about all the fertilizers and
other things you didn't count?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for the Livestock Research
Institute before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say get rid of the livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use livestock for powering your
operations in a farm, because usually
[SPEAKER_01]: those are, you know, in Ethiopia,
for example, a pair of oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not used for milk production
when, at the end of their life,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a bit of meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are eating a lot for
non-productive function except operations
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the economics,
it's better to invest in dairy cattle than
[SPEAKER_01]: in cattle for animal traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say not get rid of the livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could still have livestock,
but not to do your traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feed them to produce milk,
which is a much more rewarding way of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have projects in Mexico, which is North
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have worked in Guatemala quite a bit on
milpa systems on hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanization was not the top priority
there, because those are complex farming
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, milpa, with several species,
slopey fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So erosion problems, but I think very few
opportunities for mechanizations in those
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And further south, we don't have funding
to work in the most Latin American
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, you know, the funding is
also the thing that's driving us where we
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's presence of maize or wheat
in systems, and then the funding we can...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, there was a question there for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it actually rips on a couple of
things that have come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This issue of adaptation or adoption of
two-wheel tractors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you gave a couple of good examples of
where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the corn chiller, and one is the
axial pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: What other ideas... I mean, from this
adoption perspective, what other ideas are
[SPEAKER_04]: you following up with or directions that
you're coming up with that these two-wheel
[SPEAKER_04]: tractors can be used for co-uses?
[SPEAKER_04]: That are not directly tillage type of...
You know, those would be... Transport.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transport is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at market distribution
in Africa, usually people have to walk a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot to access markets, both for inputs,
but also for the products they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a two-wheel tractor with a
trailer is much better than using a donkey
[SPEAKER_01]: or even using your back to transport
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, transport is a thing we are really
looking up as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I have a question about the
integration of mechanization.
[SPEAKER_03]: How available is fuel?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're thinking about adoption,
are you thinking about the design and
[SPEAKER_03]: integration into the context which might
potentially lead to the availability?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuel, that's your first point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you have to build those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, in India, it's not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bangladesh is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in the middle of nowhere in
landscape in Kenya, Tanzania or Zimbabwe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to develop those services as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's a full ecosystem when you look
at... And with the data we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: we believe that it's worth investing for
governments to invest in mechanization in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be, you know, not... I
would say that would be national
[SPEAKER_01]: investment for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's the type of, you know,
pledge or plea we do when we discuss with
[SPEAKER_01]: national research programs and governments
on mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the request in Rwanda came from
the Minister of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, we want CIMIC to be involved in
mechanization and we want to develop that
[SPEAKER_01]: in our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopia is very receptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is that sometimes people
just want to take shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And take the very simplistic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They resume mechanization to just buying
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy equipment, you'll go back to
the World Bank investment in the 80s where
[SPEAKER_01]: you just get the thing not used and
destroyed in a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, unless you have trained people,
you have workshops, you have retailers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have the support in terms of fuel and
so on, there's no point in investing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first step is not buying the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easiest thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the thing that will not
work if it's done in isolation or to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing any opportunities for
electrification?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, local solar power, battery operated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have not looked at that in
particular, but I think there are programs
[SPEAKER_01]: in India, for example, looking at,
you know, the energy approach in farming
[SPEAKER_01]: systems and, of course, that's something
very, very attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, that could be part… I mean,
if you look at mechanization, under that
[SPEAKER_01]: umbrella, you can put a lot of things
that's linked to energy use in rural
[SPEAKER_01]: systems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, energy production, energy use,
so it's… Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we are out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's give him one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
