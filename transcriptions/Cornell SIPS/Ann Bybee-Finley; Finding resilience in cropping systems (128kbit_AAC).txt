[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a photo of Aurora Musgrave
Field and the trials that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for today's talk, I'm going to first
talk about the social ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, how I'm thinking about this
research, how I'm situating myself in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to talk about three
different research projects that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is plant competition within
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is mixtures within cropping
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is cropping systems within
New York's dairy farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the social ecological systems
perspective with a hyphen emerged from
[SPEAKER_00]: systems level ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are studying landscape level
things, everglades, or whole watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they realized that human action shape
the capacities of ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humans are, in fact, part of
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the thinking that I'm going
about with all this research, that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: a part of the ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SES has a specific definition for
resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has three different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the amount of disturbance a
system can absorb and still remain within
[SPEAKER_00]: the same state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how much you can absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is the degree to which the
system is capable of self organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might imagine if a farmer were to
desire to change of practice, maybe they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be able to because they're locked
in by certain regulations, or the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they need to continue something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't recreate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third thing is the degree to which
the system can build an increased capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: for learning and adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learning is a constantly an important
thing, improving on oneself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the definition or a sentence that I
really like from somewhere by Keith
[SPEAKER_00]: Tidball over in Department of Natural
Resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resilience is this interaction between
ecology, economics, social structures that
[SPEAKER_00]: restore ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about resilience,
this is really abstract term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can mean whatever you want it to mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this, I think of resilience of
a farm in the face of extreme weather
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm thinking about this is
the Northeast has got seen a 71% increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in extreme precipitation events since
1958.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph from the fourth National
Climate Assessment that came out last
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each bar is a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange line is a nine year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is, again, extreme
precipitation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that they're increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although temperatures might increase
the growing season in the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could lead to a longer growing
season, we are going to have some really
[SPEAKER_00]: wet weather, really frequent, intense
rainstorms, and also short and medium term
[SPEAKER_00]: droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think of crop diversification as a
strategy to enhance resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just go back to this thing,
putting all your eggs in one basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because essentially, this is what we're
doing with a lot of cropping systems in
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're very simplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're maxing out their productivity of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But crop diversity adds this variability
and redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this variability can, diversity begets
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more diverse plants,
likely that you're going to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you'll have more diverse insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does come at a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't as simple as all your eggs in one
basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make that clear,
because I would say that's probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest difficulty with crop
diversification as a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I understand this as a strategy,
then there's some things that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first question that I asked
myself is, how can intercrop mixtures be
[SPEAKER_00]: optimized for biopress production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we improve these crop
diversification practices even more?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm looking specifically at
intercrop mixtures, so multiple species at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question I asked myself,
what are the effects of diversity over
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they take some time to take into
effect, are we doing the right kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment that would allow us to see some
of the benefits of crop diversification?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, who's going to use this
strategy and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does it fit in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the context?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question, how can intercrop
mixtures be optimized for biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use cover crops as an example
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this experiment that we did was on
summer annual forages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to think of them as cover
crops, which they could be, less than 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: of row crop land in the United States is
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cover crops are getting a lot of hype,
but we still have a really limited
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have done studies as
to why that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the barriers identified was this
associated cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buying extra seed, having to take this
extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose of this experiment is to
examine inter- and intra-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition to understand complementarity
with the hypothesis that mixtures with
[SPEAKER_00]: greater complementarity will have greater
cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this experiment, we had two
grasses and two legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl millet abbreviated with an M,
sorghum, Sudan grass with an S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legumes were cowpea abbreviated with a C,
and sun hemp abbreviated with an H.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to refer back to some
previous work I've done that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my master's, where we published this paper
on functional diversity in summer annual
[SPEAKER_00]: legume inter-crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the same, the exact same
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just seeded three species mixtures
using a replacement rate design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a monoculture rate,
and then one third of that for three
[SPEAKER_00]: species mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one third, one third, one third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the way you assess, the most
common way to assess inter-crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's the land equivalent
ratio, which is essentially the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of that species, the proportion of the
biomass in the inter-crop divided by the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass of that species in the
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're seeding these species each
at a third of their monoculture rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: our break-even point for land equivalent
ratio would be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third of the seeds expect a third of the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see from the results,
and the abbreviations are down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the four three species mixtures all had
land equivalent ratios greater than one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, great, this inter-cropping
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is really happening within that
number?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did with this paper is we took
the single term, the partial LAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just one term of this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made each a point on a spider plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these spider plots have three species
plus three points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to fill in this inner
triangle here, that would be one third.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be your break-even point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that some mixtures have LARs
above one, and there's mutual
[SPEAKER_00]: over-yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each species does better in the inter-crop
than it would if it had been planted
[SPEAKER_00]: separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the mixtures, you see one
species is really pulling that biomass up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it comes with the consequence of
suppressing these slower-growing species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one thing we've learned is if
you're inter-cropping with annuals in a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture, they've got to have similar
growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to leave the gate at the same
time or else that kind of competition is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you won't see the benefits of these
species because they won't appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So practical questions for this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what is the optimal
seeding rate for each species to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another question is, how many
species should go into the mixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to answer the second question
for you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two because this is the bi-culture
data that I'm presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still remains a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at what the optimal
seeding rates were using this response
[SPEAKER_00]: surface design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it's a grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis, you see the percentage of
standard seeding rates for one species,
[SPEAKER_00]: say sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the y-axis, you see a
different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of design allows us to parse
out inter- and intra- specific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes across as more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, we have eight different
seeding rates of a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go from 40% of the standard seeding
rate all the way up to 120% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this for the other species,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it for all the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the bi-cultures, what we do
is we also planted eight different
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have 20% sorghum, 20% standard
seeding rate of millet, 40% sorghum,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does changing these ratios change the
outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are six different bi-culture
combinations with four species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the original eight different
seeding rates for the monoculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: 32, eight times six, 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of different plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did, how we planted this,
this happened summer of 2014 in Musgrave.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is we borrowed a cone seeder
drill from the plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got David Benchner to drive it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we seeded these small plots,
about eight square meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had applied to the field about half
the recommended rate of nitrogen for
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum, sorghum, 3 to 10 grsa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're splitting the fertility evenly
between the legumes and the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we over-fertilize, more grasses would
show up if we under-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, everything would look bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, after about 50 days, we harvested,
we took two meter quadrats cliptoed that
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass off, separated crop and weed
species, and we also collected sorghum
seed seed.
And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so biomass and density are the
important things to remember going into
[SPEAKER_00]: this next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a biomass density relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you increase density of a species,
as you add more plants to a place,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to increase the yield up
until a point where you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the yield and your per plant
weight is going to get smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is we took yield,
we have the biomass data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plugged it in there, say the biomass
and millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the density of millet,
which is NM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we plugged in the density for NM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were able to solve for A
naught, which is the weight of a millet
[SPEAKER_00]: plant without other millet plants around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for I, which is this measure of
intraspecific competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Spitter, in 1983, said,
if you add other species, this assumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: this relationship still holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with additional species,
we just added this extra term into the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Is is the measure of intraspecific
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say Ns is the density for the
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find this stuff really heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's helpful for me to go through it
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have this biomass density
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just given you some numbers to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am the intraspecific competition
coefficient is 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we were to say increase 0.1 to
0.5, we see the increase in the shape of
[SPEAKER_00]: this curve changes quite dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reaching that asymptote much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sharper curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we were to add a second species,
this is only the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to add a second species,
we see that the curve changes even more
[SPEAKER_00]: with this addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Im is back to the first panel that
is that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have this extra term Is and
then Ns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the shape, it has changed,
and that's due to the intraspecific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real life data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this for all the biocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to show you a couple of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the millet sorghum sedan grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have on the x-axis is millet
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have millet biomass on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue circles are the monocultures of
the millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green squares are the millet biomass
when it's in a millet sorghum biculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this curve is spent with the
equation that I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this dotted curve, we use the
average density of the sorghum when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the biculture with millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that for the Ns term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are able to see that the shape of
the curve changes quite a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that there's high interspecific
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add sorghum to millet,
you're going to reduce that millet
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much, you might wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then in this next graph, I have
sorghum density on the x-axis still with
[SPEAKER_00]: millet biomass on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when millet's in monoculture,
those near the blue dots, you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield declines quite a lot as you increase
the density of the sorghum sedan grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just one side of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always two sides to a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens with the sorghum when
millet is added to it, if we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really affected at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when these two curves match up,
there's less interspecific competition
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that also with this fourth graph
here with millet density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add millet density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really affecting the sorghum
sedan grass biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same graph set up as
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's millet and sorghum together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the differences between these
two curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's slight, you know, millet's
slightly affected, somewhat affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunhemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sunhemp is also slightly affected by
the millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after putting the biomass, the density,
and solving for the competition
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficients, what we got were all these
competition coefficients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do these numbers mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you relate them to one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way this is done is with the
relative competitive ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking the intraspecific
competition coefficient and dividing it by
[SPEAKER_00]: the interspecific competition coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this reads is you have millet,
millet with sorghum, millet with sunhemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: millet with cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this basically says, it takes 0.37
sorghum plants to make up a millet plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the RC is less than one,
you have greater interspecific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your denominator is larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like lots of numbers I'm throwing
at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to find patterns within
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening across these six
different biocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was just separated out,
and I went through and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: which one's bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inter, intra, inter, intra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some patterns did emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see with sorghum, sedangrass,
intraspecific competition was always
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than interspecific competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with cowpea, like a whole
different story, intraspecific competition
[SPEAKER_00]: was greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go out to a field, and you look
at the field, you can kind of guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, wow, this cowpea plant in
upstate New York, it probably isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: growing as well as the sorghum,
sedangrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other two species, millet and
sunhemp, they're a bit of a mixed bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two sides to every story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you weigh both sides of the
story?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you figure out what the true story
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the ultimate story is?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just multiply the relative
competition coefficients together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get the niche differentiation
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this niche differentiate index is
above one, then resource partitioning is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the intraspecies overall,
for both of the species, both sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: story, intraspecific competition is
greater than interspecific competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means it's better to have
different plants with different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize that resource partitioning,
get more resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I multiplied the RCs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the NDIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in chronological order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this other pattern emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say it so excitingly, because I was
so pumped to finally see something come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the millet plants were in the
top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have the highest NDI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me something about millets,
millet plants, and they're good partners
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing, good partner plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So results today, relative competitive
ability going from high to low,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum, sedangrass, sunhemp, millet,
followed by cowweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the mixtures with the greatest
complementarity contains millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third thing overall,
just in general, is that we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: use these kinds of findings to recommend
seeding rates that can maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: predictivity of the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps, and I haven't done it yet,
because the economics might tell a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different side of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But perhaps this could reduce the cost
barrier if we improve the precision of
[SPEAKER_00]: these mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second question I'm going to ask
is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the effects of crop diversity
over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did for this experiment,
first in background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This experiment was funded by an organic
research extension initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you, Grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking at organic managed
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason this is important is
because 44% of certified organic producers
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York has the most of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the largest producer of milk,
organic milk, in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other competitors are Texas and
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're operating at a whole different
magnitude of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since 2014, the number of certified
organic farms in New York has doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Northeast, in the face of
extreme weather events, farmers are having
[SPEAKER_00]: some trouble meeting the pasture rule,
which requires that organic herds be out
[SPEAKER_00]: on pasture for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think that farmers could
supplement their production perhaps by
[SPEAKER_00]: planting some annuals, be able to extend
that growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where we're
operationalizing resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resilience is an abstract term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great, but how does it actually work
in real life?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we want cropping systems that
absorb risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at different levels
of crop diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also want to be able to adapt
to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at two different
cropping systems, perennial and annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would allow the farmer to pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something should happen in their
perennial fields, say the summer slums,
[SPEAKER_00]: what could they do to feed their cows now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then third one, which I'm not talking
about at all, is restoring production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what external factors are out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the farmer have access to capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they get a loan from a bank that would
help them do these practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting disaster payments?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we looked at four
different levels of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the low diversity level,
one species, one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we looked at the conspecific
diversity, so we still had one species,
[SPEAKER_00]: but instead we have four different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we tried to do is max out the variety
of those varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say for all Fafo, we chose different
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was crown rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was ranch rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them had potato leaf hopper
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them claimed to have the best
forage quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to look for different seed
sellers to also max on that diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: case they're developing lines from the
same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then for the high level of
diversity, so that was conspecific,
[SPEAKER_00]: one species, four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for the heterospecific, we had four
different species, each at one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the high level, we had four
species, four different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we tried to max variety out,
we did try for similar winter dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our experiments to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did try and line up maturity
because that's a big thing if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple species, but then you're gonna
get an optimal forage quality from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have two different cropping
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: An alfalfa based perennial system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then alfalfa orchard grass,
Timothyan white clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a double cropped annual system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter annuals had triticale,
triticale, cereal, rye, winter pea,
[SPEAKER_00]: red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the summer annuals had cedar grass,
cedar grass, pearl millet, sorghum,
[SPEAKER_00]: cedar grass, and rye grass together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this experiment took place in our
beloved Musgrave Farms in Aurora,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also happened on other research
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working with Heather Derby up in
Vermont and Rich Smith in New Hampshire in
[SPEAKER_00]: Madbury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine, all these sites are
quite different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have cooler climates, different
climates, different weather, different
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are a lot of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about, oh, planting date,
harvesting date, how much fertilizer to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided to do was to manage
each site independently, but really get on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same track, following the same
protocols, going through the same process
[SPEAKER_00]: and the decision making to how,
you know, like what our cues were for
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we established this experiment in the
summer of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016 randomized complete block design with
four to five replications per site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going into the management in a little
more detail, we manage each cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system by, we manage the two cropping
systems differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we manage each cropping system at the,
set by the needs of the low diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the more conservative approach
because you're adding diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really making it more difficult to
see positive results when you add
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see good things happening from,
or can be normative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also followed a fertilizer
recommendations made by seasonal soil
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, each site had a different phosphorus
extraction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all send things to Agro One.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did, we told them what crops we were
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we followed what they recommended
for fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were harvesting, we site similar
thresholds for the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alfalfa was harvest stage two when
there were one to two buds per node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triticale was at swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food stage, seed and grass, when it was
about three feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this figure was developed by Chris
Pelzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like it because they kind of
maps out what the potential is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, can you guys, I think they're writing
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have months at the bottom and these
blue bars indicate winter annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow is summer annuals and these black
squares are when we think we could take a
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are potential harvest scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the annuals, maybe we only get one cut
for the summer annuals, but perhaps we
[SPEAKER_00]: could get two cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the perennials, there are a
whole myriad of options we could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were aiming to take three cuts and the
first year we only got two cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this past year, growing season 2018,
we got four cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty, you know, this sort of
shows the flexibility that the different
[SPEAKER_00]: sites have as to like what they're going
to do and why they might do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some hypotheses for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The annual system will be more productive
than the perennial system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that productivity and stability,
yield stability, will be greater in more
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have this cool photo of just a
tritical monoculture and then the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: the mixture of those four species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can visually see the difference
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just briefly going to tell you
about results, not from this most recent
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season, because I do not yet have
that data, but from the growing season
[SPEAKER_00]: before, so 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cumulative growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York's a little bit warmer than
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have cumulative precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might remember, and I will never
forget, 2017 was a very wet year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard for alfalfa to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont had a little bit of a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a drier season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data collecting for this experiment and
some analyses that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop biomass, weed biomass, we'll look at
weed communities, forage quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll look at the economics in a partial
budget analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other work that's happening is we're
looking at soil health, differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, so that's with Uri,
who's a grad student with Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I had a student do her
honors thesis just this past year with
[SPEAKER_00]: disease incidence and severity in these
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really trying to fill out this
information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So briefly some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a linear mix model where I summed
the crop biomass up over the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so total crop biomass and all for each
treatment in each system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use location system diversity and
their interactions as fixed effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did see a significant interaction
between location and system and also
[SPEAKER_00]: significance in the different diversity as
we see here in this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the total crop biomass and we
see that the hetero and high these higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: more diverse mixtures produce more
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this was largely because
alfalfa didn't really like all this wet
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you added grasses to it,
the grasses, orchard grass in the Timothy
[SPEAKER_00]: were much more tolerant, could produce a
lot more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what's driving the
differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this past year, it looked a lot
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alfalfa made a comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2017, the results between location and
cropping system, New Hampshire and New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, the annual cropping system produced
more biomass than the perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Vermont, we didn't see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps that was because Vermont was a
little drier also there is likely a
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Heather has had a lot of
experience growing alfalfa, whereas I had
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So measure of stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one measure of stability is the
coefficient of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the measure of dispersal,
where the yield similar, where they quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take the standard deviation and
divide it by the means for those
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just the averages across all
the different sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, the lower the CV,
the more stable the crop yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that perennials have
numerically lower CV than the annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see that the high diversity
treatments had a lower CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that lower CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's all I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So results to date, the annuals did look
to be more productive than the perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: More diverse treatments were more
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the 2018 growing season, the alfalfa
made a huge bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if either of us were going
to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to get two cuts of those
summer annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got four cuts for the perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take one last harvest,
the winter annuals, and one more cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: the perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that'll be it for this experiment
in my field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I don't have a ton of time left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about this third
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science doesn't happen in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the context of who are going to use
crop diversification strategy and why
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to use them, that's really
important, I think, to consider and to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind as I do this other research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So briefly, the state of dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected these headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I tell people, oh,
I'm going to do interviews with dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody tits me down and looks me
straight in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, you know, it's a really
terrible time for dairy farmers right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks really hard to be a dairy
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all kinds of headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are managing for their margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time they can make a couple cents
extra, that's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a spate of bankruptcies,
New York being one of the larger ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is from, I just grabbed these
from Winston et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are dairy farmers, and I know
they're blurry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are dairy farmers in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before in the 1960s, we had about
110,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in 2000, it's about 20,000 dairy
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the milk, the herd size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of milking cows per 1,000
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone from 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's declined.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have less cows than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are making more milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, to me, an astonishing idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since the 1960s, we've gone from,
on average, say 8,000 pounds per year all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to about 18,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's incredible advancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more specifically, what am I
trying to do with this body of work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in what farmer
characteristics influence the adoption of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop diversification practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in how a farmer's social
network, how that influences adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more generally, how farmers
conceptualize resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my idea of what resilience is is
probably quite different from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else's definition of resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do with this,
here's my plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really been done yet,
so it's still very much, but it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: solid plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done it yet, but I think it's a
pretty solid plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at this Western production
region, which is the big milk production
[SPEAKER_00]: region in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's surrounding counties, counties
that are also facing similar weather
[SPEAKER_00]: events as I am with my field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and talk to 50 farmers,
organic and conventionally managed
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, across a range of herd sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these interviews will take I would say
about an hour each.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a long time developing this
interview guide, and Rich knows from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of draft one, and now I think
it's like draft 20 something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're halfway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, general farm question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many acres do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you supported by an off-farm income?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much land do you rent versus own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sell your milk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also have cropping systems
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the bulk of it is,
because this is where my research
[SPEAKER_00]: interests lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your typical crop rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past five years, have you had
significant yield loss on your fields
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying to understand what the
farmer is going through and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: consider their cropping system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, I ask about the awareness,
perception, the extent of adoption,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they've started to adopt or considering
adopting a practice, motivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: various for all these different crop
diversification practices, and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra ones thrown in, because I think
might be helpful to enhance the resilience
[SPEAKER_00]: that if they have reduced tillage,
they have tile drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'm asking farmers about
their networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more like a survey portion of
the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the interview is like a
conversation, and I'm talking to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then this reads like a survey,
and farmers can check what events have
[SPEAKER_00]: they attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: What organizations do they belong to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What resources do they access when they're
looking for different kinds of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: diversification information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do they turn to for advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, and I've done a few interviews,
so far, every farmer has told me they talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to their local extension agent when asked
when looking, when seeking advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is a really important idea
to not forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some hypotheses on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I'm talking to organic and
conventional days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot that can be said
values, judgment, the different actors in
[SPEAKER_00]: these two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think crop diversification I'll see more
crop diversification practices in the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic manner system, in part because
there's a regulation that requires that
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers go to pasture with their herd,
and maybe less so in conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is that there's probably
different pathways for adoption of these
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would use different language,
you would interact with different groups
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wanted to get these ideas diffused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another idea that I have is to measure
aspects of resilience, and these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: three components I introduced earlier,
the absorptive, adaptive, restorative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just listed some of the things that
I'm asking out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of a conceptual idea in
the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have higher soiler gain,
in the organic manner, then you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to absorb more risk, and if you have
seen greater yield stability, less yield
[SPEAKER_00]: loss perhaps, that's a greater example of
having resilience or a more resilient
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So progress so far on this project,
I did five pilot interviews during the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were with conventional farmers,
two were with organic farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every time, every time I talk to
somebody new, I think, oh, here's a better
[SPEAKER_00]: way to organize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how the flow could improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've added new questions as they've come
up, changed wording for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really iterative process and
just, yeah, it's a great learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to continue to do the
interviews this winter and next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to circle back around to what I talked
about in the beginning, to understand crop
[SPEAKER_00]: diversification as a strategy to enhance
resilience, I asked how can intercrop
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures be optimized for biomass
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can design mixtures that maximize
complementarity using these competition
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people talk about digital ag or
precision ag, and I get very excited
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, that's where I see this
fitting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really data-intensive effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what are the effects of crop
diversity over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to study this and design
experiments that allow us to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these benefits that we're not
going to see for a while, or may not see
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't plan an extreme weather event or
I guess, yeah, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, who's going to use this
strategy and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so different farms likely have
different adoption pathways who people are
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to finish this up, I'd like to thank
this whole list of people that were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, you couldn't have done it
without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate all the conversations
that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, a big thank you to my lab
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have time for at least one
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that first experiment with the entry
for the competition, what kind of millet
[SPEAKER_03]: was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the most used by what species?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it adapted to our region?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wonderleaf pearl millet,
and we got it from King's Agra Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been selling this kind of
millet to farmers in Pennsylvania and New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine it was adapted, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, great, all the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked how you, the rigorous
mechanistic question that you tried to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: in your first section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering whether you could shoot
from the hip and say, what were the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons that made millet such a good
mixture body?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you consider measuring root activity
distribution or light interception or any
[SPEAKER_01]: other traits that would identify what it
made such a good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the term millet as a planting
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent days of my life out in the
field with a point sensor and a light bar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough to take that kind of light
interception, but to shoot from the hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think millet is a good planting buddy
because it's very plastic in terms that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty adaptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sees, I'm going to anthropomorphize
this plant a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sees the plant and it says,
I know what your strengths and weaknesses
[SPEAKER_00]: are, and I can sort of adapt to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I think about it,
but I haven't taken any mechanistic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data with the light interceptions
didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't looked at the wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this guy does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Harold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, and I was wondering about,
what can you really recommend to a farmer
[SPEAKER_02]: at this point in time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the questions that always kind
of comes up is, you have this location
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction and probably location is
weather as well, weather soil and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and I think that's always the
challenge that we have in making
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other factors that come into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, maybe your fields did not
receive manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on these farms, they would have
received manure with the competitive
[SPEAKER_02]: ability of say a millet be changed if
there was manure in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you at this point in time
comfortable standing up in front of a
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd of farmers and say, these are some
of the conclusions that I can draw from my
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can be pretty assured that this will
work out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to stand up in front of a
group of farmers, I would say millets
[SPEAKER_00]: three times cheaper than any of the other
seed that I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the economics of this situation,
even though agronomically, that's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: we just talked about, but I think
economically, that's a pretty pressing
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then planting alfalfa with grasses
seem to be a great way to ensure more
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think farmers in New York tend to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think craft diversification will,
I think we'd be in a very scary place if
[SPEAKER_00]: there were prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think these solutions are
prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ability to create the space
for the farmer to find out what exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: works for their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the way to go about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you mentioned how you were
going to locate your dairy farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a strategy for trying to make
that as random as possible without
[SPEAKER_04]: reporting bias?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plan is within this Western region,
within these counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is ask the county
extension agents for some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I would try and get a more even
number because I won't be able to not
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting quantitative data on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be all nonparametric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be a normal sample site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I can do is say, oh, extension
agent, do you have some large farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: some small farmers, some of these farmers,
some of those farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And generate a list from that and try and
ask for as great a variety as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: really early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using a snowball sampling method,
which I think is the full name for a
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get like a really diverse bottom
layers, like across a range of sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you ask those farmers,
hey, can you recommend somebody that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like you to farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can sort of percolate those
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys again for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
