[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to tell you a journey that I
feel is a little bit of a two-fold
[SPEAKER_02]: journey, because it's partially a journey
of me and my research and how it
[SPEAKER_02]: progressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also going to be talking about the
journey that sugar takes through a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be talking about phloem
transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started my scientific career more in
the field of ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even my graduate research was asking
ecological questions and trying to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about the different physiological factors,
the different aspects of plant stress
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance that influence where species
occur across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very basic questions in terms of
ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was doing a lot of this work,
I kept finding what I felt was a familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at all the things that
influence the way that plants interact
[SPEAKER_02]: with the environment, a lot of it has to
do with resource allocation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they investing in really
stress-tolerant structures?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have very dense wood that can deal
with drought conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they changing their growth rate at
different times of the year?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing work on wetland plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And root elongation was really important
in determining where they were occurring
[SPEAKER_02]: and how fast they could establish at
different sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of different aspects of
carbon allocation or other kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient allocation that impact the way
that plants interact with other organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: and the way they interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so through all this work, it made me
start thinking about, well, what is
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in terms of this allocation and
specifically in terms of the carbon and I
[SPEAKER_02]: started thinking about how carbon is moved
around in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we know about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does it affect these larger
processes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got interested in studying the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this may all be reviewed to you,
but I figured I'd take a moment and talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to you about how the phloem functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the phloem is the part of the vascular
system that transports sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it operates in a very specific
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very directional.
[SPEAKER_02]: On one hand, you have an area that's
providing the sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your source tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We often think of this as being the lead
because it's where photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_02]: happening, but it can also be coming out
of storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that source tissue, you have the
loading of a lot of sugars happening into
[SPEAKER_02]: the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really important because it
causes the phloem to have a high pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a whole bunch of
water move in after you have the loading
[SPEAKER_02]: of the sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This pressure is important because it's
part of what drives phloem transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other parts of the plant, any place
that's having active growth, this could be
[SPEAKER_02]: your roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be an apical meristem that's
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having a similar but opposite
phenomenon happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's removing sugar from the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this part of the plant,
you're pulling out the sugar and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing the pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant causes this pressurized,
this pressure gradient that drives this
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation from the source to the sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the way that we think
transport happens in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, similar to the diagram that I've
shown here, you often will see pictures of
[SPEAKER_02]: the phloem that look like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like a large pipe, an empty tube
with these plates in between the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is very stylized and I always
like to show a picture of what the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a scanning electron micrograph
of a cell in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I like this picture is
because it reminds us that this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: living tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about models that you'd
use in phloem transport, how we think
[SPEAKER_02]: about carbon moving in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a system here of
interconnected living cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have fewer organelles than a lot of
the neighboring cells, but they do have
[SPEAKER_02]: organelles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, I would say they
have a membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is something that's really
important, not just for how the phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: functions, but it's also really important
in explaining why we don't know much about
[SPEAKER_02]: the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a system that is pressurized,
that's surrounded by a membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means if you manipulate it,
if you cut it, you can influence not only
[SPEAKER_02]: how it functions, but where everything is
inside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for a long time, there's been a lot
of debates about what even the phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like in an intact system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one thing I'm really interested in
is trying to understand the connection,
[SPEAKER_02]: this basic connection between structure
and function.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of the baseline when you get
into physiology, but it's something we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really understand that well in the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can think about this on a lot of
different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants have complex, three-dimensional
architecture, and different branching
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can imagine how this would impact where
carbon can move, how it can move,
[SPEAKER_02]: and growth patterns, but we don't
understand the connections that lie there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can think about on a tissue level,
there's a lot of variation in what phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like and how much different plants
have and where it's located.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do not have a good idea of what
that means in terms of plant growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: reproduction, or even just patterns of
carbon movement in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get down to the cellular
level, so here, we're looking at those
[SPEAKER_02]: tubes with the individual cells that are
separated by plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a large amount of variation among
species in what the cells look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: They vary in what the plates look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: They vary in how large the tubes are,
and we don't understand the implications
[SPEAKER_02]: of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just starting to scratch the surface
on some of these pretty basic questions in
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to understand the design of the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does it work so well, and what are the
implications of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I want to talk to you about
today is three different projects that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked on that are trying to get at
this connection between structure and
[SPEAKER_02]: function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've organized this in terms of three
different questions so I've been curious
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about how does phloem physiology
and anatomy impact how much carbon can be
[SPEAKER_02]: moved in a plant, how far it can be moved,
and when it can be moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm gonna start with the very
seasonally appropriate first one,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is work on pumpkins, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost Halloween, so I had to talk
about pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got interested in this because I was
curious what happens when you have a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that's allocating a lot of carbon really
rapidly to one developing structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to look at this, I didn't look at
just any pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured I wanted to find the biggest
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did my work on giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the pleasure of working with the
New England giant pumpkin growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are many of the growers that I
worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also did this work in collaboration with
Missy Holbrook and Dustin Haynes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started thinking about these
giant pumpkins and trying to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: and figure out how they're able to move so
much carbon into this developing
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I did is I decided to compare
different types or different varieties of
[SPEAKER_02]: this species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So giant pumpkins are all in the species
Cucurbita maxima.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know this species from Hubbard
squash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of squashes that have the
same species.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just different variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this giant pumpkin is not related to
the field pumpkin that you typically know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been under very strong selection
for over the last century for size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people have been competitively
growing pumpkins in this country since the
[SPEAKER_02]: early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And gradually over time, we've seen an
increase in the size of these pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big breakthroughs was in the
1970s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the development of the Atlantic
giant variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the variety that is used in almost
all of the giant pumpkin competitions
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure it could be that this
very moment, this record's being broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets broken very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it up to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the time of season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the world record is somewhere around
2,600 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these can grow very large.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to understand what's happening with
giant pumpkins, I decided I wanted to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at several varieties of Cucurbita maxima
and look at their phloem from source to
[SPEAKER_02]: sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thinking about their leaves all the way
to the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I picked two giant varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Atlantic giant are the competitive
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are mammoth ones, which are another
smaller, but also giant pumpkin variety,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Hubbard squash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all the same species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they invest different amounts in their
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew all of these in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the work I'm going to talk to
you about is greenhouse work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was also able to work with the
giant pumpkin growers and get data from
[SPEAKER_02]: field-grown giant pumpkins to add to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk to you a little bit about
what I found in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing I started doing was
looking at some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a difference in how much they
photosynthesize?
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a source level, in terms of carbon
being fixed, it's similar among all the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at some aspects of the fruit,
especially the young ovaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And despite the fact that the Hubbard
squash had a slightly different shape and
[SPEAKER_02]: color, it actually was remarkably similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cell sizes in the tissues are the
same, the same water content, the same
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon content, same mass, very similar
early trajectory in their growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to look at how much carbon
is being moved in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at this in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've done some work on cucurbits in the
past, where I have measured phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: transport using a fluorescent dye.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we can get into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing this and using really
sensitive light sensors can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: detect movement in an intact plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you actually don't have to cut into the
plant or disturb anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to do this on the leaves
of these different pumpkin species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same as when I looked at
photosynthesis, when you look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of carbon, so this is the
volumetric transport in these three
[SPEAKER_02]: different varieties out of the leaves,
they're exporting the same amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not a difference here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're starting to notice a pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also not a difference there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you look at the cells in the phloem,
you look at these are the plates that
[SPEAKER_02]: separate the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same size, same pore size.
[SPEAKER_02]: The transport cells are same in all the
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're dealing with just one
species.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one species in all these
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So huge difference in what's happening
with the growth of the fruit at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of similarities, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did find one distinct difference
that was really strong between these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had to do with the amount of phloem
that they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you looked at a cellular level,
the cells were the same, but they had more
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the cross sectional area of the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it here in the pedicel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also looked at it in the stem and the
petiole.
[SPEAKER_02]: These patterns are true really throughout
the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the two giant varieties,
they have about 3% more phloem than the
[SPEAKER_02]: non-giant variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the field grown ones have even higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can't differentiate between whether
this is a genetic effect of it being more
[SPEAKER_02]: of an award-winning genotype or whether
it's driven by the environmental effects
[SPEAKER_02]: of being grown in a field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these three varieties were all grown
in the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this looks like is happening is
there has been a big shift in the giant
[SPEAKER_02]: pumpkins from other varieties,
cucurbit and maxima, in the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: phloem that they actually have inside of
their tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in addition to that, there are some
interesting differences that are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: way the phloem is structured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always put this out when I talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe somebody here knows more about this
than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just find it a little bit odd.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think a cucurbit is having very
consistent vascular structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: These giant varieties, even when their
fruits are at a young age, start having
[SPEAKER_02]: some irregularities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would often see vascular bundles
appearing in the middle of the cortex,
[SPEAKER_02]: which could create these strings in the
center of the stem in the pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you start having really weird vascular
and irregular vascular arrangements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit of an interesting
pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to having more phloem,
the way it's arranged starts changing,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially as they get bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was curious to try to understand this
shift, this 3% shift in the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: phloem, does it actually matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it make a difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get at this, I actually worked with
the pumpkin growers to model carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: transport into the pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the pumpkin growers are really
careful at measuring the dimensions of
[SPEAKER_02]: their pumpkins, often daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's more weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got very detailed charts about
how weight relates to size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can look at these growth
trajectories for all of these pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was also able to get samples from
some of the field-grown plants to get an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of how much water and carbon and how
much phloem there was in the plants at
[SPEAKER_02]: each of their stages during development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's pretty amazing when you start
getting into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know these are large pumpkins,
not surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start looking at the date and you
realize they can grow 20 kilograms a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little bit mind-boggling,
at least to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of carbon, that could be
somewhere around 600 grams of carbon can
[SPEAKER_02]: be moving into the pumpkin in one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I used the data that I had to
actually look at transport velocity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious how fast is carbon moving
into these pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is transport velocity with mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could talk for a while about the
trends and if there's a trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to go into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to draw attention to is some
of the numbers that we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_02]: which may not have meaning to you unless
you've actually measured a lot of phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing to note is that in any
literature I've found on cucurbits,
[SPEAKER_02]: so going beyond pumpkins, talking about
cucumbers, they all have a phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: transport velocity that tends to average
somewhere in this range.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really common.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're around 0.12, 0.1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where this falls out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting is if you go into
this model and you ask the question,
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens if we decrease the
cross-sectional area of phloem so that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's more like the Hubbard squash,
you would have to have velocities that are
[SPEAKER_02]: almost three times larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are larger than anything we've
ever measured in a cucurbit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they're not beyond the range that
we've seen in other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this makes you think, or it makes me
think about what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so getting to this question with giant
pumpkins, it seems like what's happening
[SPEAKER_02]: is these pumpkins are able to move a lot
of carbon into that developing fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have more phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to think about this in terms
of a simple equation, you've got the area
[SPEAKER_02]: of the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The transport velocity, and that's going
to determine that volumetric flow rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are increasing the area,
but the velocity seems to be saying
[SPEAKER_02]: similar into the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, this is interesting because it
creates another question, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what makes the most exciting
research, I think, is when you're left
[SPEAKER_02]: with a bigger question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I see when I look at this is a
question about transport capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it that cucurbits don't just
increase the flow through those tubes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a limit to how fast they can move
carbon with their anatomy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that the strategy that we see
here for increasing flow rate into a
[SPEAKER_02]: pumpkin results from more tissue instead
of increased capacity of transport in
[SPEAKER_02]: those tissue, to me, makes me wonder about
what is actually happening, and how does
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbit anatomy influence phloem
transport velocity?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a question that I'm hoping to
look at more in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now for something very
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to jump around systems,
so maybe there's a little bit for
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone, I'm hoping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go from talking about
pumpkins and more of an agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: system to talking about trees and vines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of ongoing debate
and discussion about how plants are able
[SPEAKER_02]: to move carbon really long distances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some trees can get 100 meters tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long distance to move from the
canopy to the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is especially a challenging thing
to think about when you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: the mechanism that I explained.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a situation where just these
local osmotic gradients are creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure that's driving passively carbon
movement the whole length of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you increase the length of that
pathway, you should be increasing the
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basics of fluid flow through a
pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, then as you grow
taller, you wouldn't be able to move as
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trees would have slower and slower and
slower carbon transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a little bit problematic to
the way that we think about growth and the
[SPEAKER_02]: way that we think about the vaster system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I worked in collaboration with
Missy again and also Michael Knoblauch at
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington State to try to get at this
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started initially in a system that
was a little simpler than trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with a morning glow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with a morning glory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we wanted to do with a morning
glory was measure basically as much as we
[SPEAKER_02]: could about the phloem and see if we could
get the numbers to add up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this theory about how phloem
transport happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if we measure everything that
goes into those equations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it actually work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does it change as you increase the
length of the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here I've given you just a simple
equation for flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you may be familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you may not, but bear with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're having pressure-driven
flow, the velocity, how fast it can move,
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be related to the pressure
gradient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the pressure between the source
and the sink and whatever the resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: is in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to be influenced by the
height of the tree, the viscosity of the
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be influenced by the anatomy
of the tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a large group of us that
were in Missy and Michael's lab that all
[SPEAKER_02]: threw everything we could at this,
just to give you an idea of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people and some of the stuff that was
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measured phloem transport velocity
using C11.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of detailed microscopy work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collaborated with a physicist who
helped us model it, Cor Jensen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We estimated viscosity inside of sieve
tubes using molecular rotors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used some newly developed pressure
gauges to measure pressure in the
[SPEAKER_02]: different tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are sort of two key things that
jumped out when we looked at this,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to understand what's actually
happening in terms of all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different factors as a plant's growing
taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are they actually slowing down their
carbon transport or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of the things that we found was
that that pressure inside of the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: increased as the morning glories got
taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is a little schematic of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We altered the length partially by
manipulating where the lowest leaf was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the longest difference between a
source and a sink on a whole handful of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we measured pressure in the phloem at
those top leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we find is that as you get to be
longer, at least if you're morning glory,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pressure inside of the phloem and the
leaf increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's suggesting, well, maybe these plants
are compensating by just pressurizing
[SPEAKER_02]: their phloem more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this wasn't the only difference that
we saw, that wasn't the only thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened as the plants grew taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that happened is their
anatomy changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the sieve plates that connect
the cells in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you go from the top to the bottom
of one of these tall plants, you will find
[SPEAKER_02]: that those plates get more and more
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have more and more pores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pores are bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tubes are bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the anatomy of the plant is actually
changing as the plant's growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really important when we're
thinking about resistance of a tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever want to make water move faster
through a tube, make that tube wider.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simplest thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having these kinds of structural
changes we think are really important in
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing these plants to transport over
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it decreases that resistance that
they're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really cool and great and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, the question was, well,
hell, this morning glory is still just 14
[SPEAKER_02]: meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really as big as plants can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also, it's an herbaceous or
herbaceous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that there are differences in
species in what's happening in that phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: loading zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of trees appear to have a more
passive loading system in terms of how
[SPEAKER_02]: they move sugar into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is important when we're thinking
about this phenomenon that we saw in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning glory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the morning glory show this ability to
increase the pressure in their phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our best thought is that this has to
do with the fact that they actively load
[SPEAKER_02]: sugars into their phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is a control mechanism there
for potentially altering the pressure in
[SPEAKER_02]: the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a lot of trees, they rely just on
a concentration gradient from the
[SPEAKER_02]: mesophyll into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of system is hard to
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to imagine that it could
pressurize easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our suspicion was is that they weren't
doing the same thing as the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: glories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I led a project to look
specifically at trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at nine different species to try
to see what was happening and how phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: anatomy changed with height.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we looked at a lot of the same
things that we looked at the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are those longitudinal sections,
looking at the plates, using scan-electric
[SPEAKER_02]: moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microscopy to look more detailed at the
plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sampled trees at multiple heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found a very similar pattern to
what we saw in the morning glory in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of their anatomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found that this is the bottom of a
tree and the top of a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tubes were bigger at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were often more pores in the plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pores in the plates were bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what this is suggesting is that as
trees are getting taller, the same as
[SPEAKER_02]: morning glories are getting bigger,
the new vasco tissue they're making is
[SPEAKER_02]: larger and can move more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are adjusting as they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really important because it
helps prevent issues with growing tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be very inefficient if you could
only grow a few meters before your
[SPEAKER_02]: transport of carbon became slow.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the tree was very young, are you
getting to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, were the pores smaller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did they anticipate by having large
pores?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to talk about the work
that we've done within the same species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they're smaller, they all have
smaller conduits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is some variation between
species in how big the conduits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that does seem to relate to size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be that there's a little bit
of both in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what some of the data looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to explain this to you
because it's a little bit counterintuitive
[SPEAKER_02]: if you haven't looked at many graphs of
scaling relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Higher resistance would mean slower
transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do this as distance from the top of
the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the base of the tallest trees,
the resistance is the lowest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you go towards the top of the trees
and as you move towards shorter trees,
[SPEAKER_02]: the resistance gets higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like, from what we can tell,
the relationship within a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: within a species is the same as across
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be a pretty constant scaling
relationship that we see in how resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: scales with height, which is really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, the thing that it leaves us
with is this question of, is it enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: The morning glory had to do this and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the trees doing more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the anatomical changes we're seeing
here enough to allow for transport in
[SPEAKER_02]: really tall trees?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get at this, we also went back to
modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are some things that,
unfortunately, we just can't always
[SPEAKER_02]: measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the modeling gives us a nice framework
for how to think about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are some basic models of the
phloem, looking at how we would expect
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure to change with different anatomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had a situation where there was
no change in anatomy along the length of a
[SPEAKER_02]: tree, as you got taller, you would need to
have a really high pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you put into the model this same
scaling relationship that we saw,
[SPEAKER_02]: where resistance actually just decreases
because the tubes get bigger and the pores
[SPEAKER_02]: get bigger, it drops off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't ever need those really high
pressures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to know whether this was
in the range of what you could find in the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf of a tree in terms of the pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that reasonable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can a tree achieve that much pressure?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to do this, oh, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to explain these two lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did make some differences in our
assumptions about the cross-sectional area
[SPEAKER_02]: of the phloem because it's a little bit
complicated to measure this in a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't matter much for the actual
pattern we hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we decided to try to measure pressure
in leaves on intact trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we built a scaffolding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used a bucket truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought a microscope up to the canopy
and used these little Pico gauges.
[SPEAKER_02]: This work was done primarily by Jan and
Michael Noblock to actually measure
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure in leaves in tall trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was the oak that we
studied had a pressure that was close to a
[SPEAKER_02]: megapascal, which is completely within the
range that would make transport feasible
[SPEAKER_02]: with this anatomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this suggests is the changes that
we're seeing in the anatomy these changes
[SPEAKER_02]: in trees in terms of the resistance is
enough to allow tall trees to transport
[SPEAKER_02]: really long distances without much
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The morning glory seems to have this added
capability to pressurize its phloem,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is also helping as it elongates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're having these really
interesting changes that are facilitating
[SPEAKER_02]: long distance transport in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I mentioned, we're also doing
some work within species now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing work on oaks of different
sizes to try to understand what happens as
[SPEAKER_02]: plants develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have a larger data set of
about 50 species that include more vines
[SPEAKER_02]: and trees and herbs to get an
understanding on how height impacts a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole variety of these different organisms
and what their phloem looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming on about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last thing I want to leave you with
is some work that I'm more recently
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into and this is just the
beginning phases of it, but I have become
[SPEAKER_02]: really interested in what happens
seasonally in plants and how they change
[SPEAKER_02]: and specifically how the carbon transport
system change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once again, I've gone back full
circle instead of going to fruit I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go to flowers, but thinking again about
transport into a specific organ as it's
[SPEAKER_02]: developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a sort of a battering of
research out there on what happens to the
[SPEAKER_02]: phloem in the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of information on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some great classic work done
using aphids to collect phloem samples and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the concentration of sugars
that suggests in the winter sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations get higher in the sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not necessarily surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be what you would expect compared
to what's happening in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also been a lot of anatomical work
looking at callous deposition and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes this is deposited and then
dissolved in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it appears that plants just
forsake their phloem from that year and
[SPEAKER_02]: don't reuse it the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless of the way you look at it,
phloem transport likely decreases.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the winter in most species either
because of viscosity or because of
[SPEAKER_02]: occlusion and because they're just not
moving as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me this begs the question of well
what's happening in the spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got interested in this because I
have had a lifelong love of willows and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a lot of work on them and I love
the fact that they flower so early in the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of plants both in our
horticultural and our natural landscape
[SPEAKER_02]: that do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often the first growth we see is flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this made me start wondering about well
what's happening in the phloem of these
[SPEAKER_02]: species?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they actually growing these new
organs sometimes when there's still snow
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ground in the spring?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been doing work on five just
different genera here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've done is I have pairs of
species that flower really early without
[SPEAKER_02]: their leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they flower precociously and ones that
flower later with their leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're in the same genus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can try to separate out what's
happening in terms of the flowers and in
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves in development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just going to show you a little
bit of the work they've been doing on
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been trying to think about when
and how is carbon moving into this bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I started with just a simple
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: These all have preformed flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make them the year before in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not at full size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some certain amount of carbon
flux.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a period of dormancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the spring they're going to
have more carbon flux as they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to know what's happening in
terms of the timing of this and how much
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon is moving in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first thing I did is I just
looked at biomass and carbon content of
[SPEAKER_02]: the tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is some of the data here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the floral biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're looking at the biomass as a
percentage of the total flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take a dormant bud and you say,
how much does that weigh?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what percentage of the final weight of
the flower is that dormant bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: This gives you an idea of how much does it
actually have to grow in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dormant buds, for example,
of the Hammamalus, the witch hazel,
[SPEAKER_02]: are almost 90% of the final weight of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show very little growth in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost everything they need to flower is
there before they get dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with other species, it's more
variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing that came out
when I just did this simple look at these
[SPEAKER_02]: different pairs is that there's a big
difference based on when you flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some ways, maybe this also seems
intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these plants that are flowering really
early are investing much more of their
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon the year prior to flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than the ones that flower later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the darker purple here, you can see
they're all larger for each species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put some pictures here of the
dissected buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all at the same scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a precocious early flowering
cornice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a non-precocious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the magnolia and the salix.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was consistent across all of the
groups that I've looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that flower early always invest
more carbon in their buds prior to
[SPEAKER_02]: dormancy, prior to the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that being said, none of them,
besides Hamamalus is pretty borderline,
[SPEAKER_02]: put all their carbon in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they all need their phloem in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that's what all the evidence suggests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually tried to test this by
looking at girdling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I girdled these branches, removed the
phloem to see what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you girdle them, they don't
increase in biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no growth in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might still bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to be tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be the same weight as
they were during dormancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like they need actin phloem in
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually probably require the
phloem for more than just the carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spent almost this whole talk talking
about carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that carbon comes in an aqueous
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're talking about small
structures that don't use a lot of water,
[SPEAKER_02]: the phloem can actually be really
important in hydrating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did some models looking at how
much water you need, based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements I took of the buds,
for those flowers to expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for most of the species, there is
enough water in the phloem to hydrate
[SPEAKER_02]: those flowers prior to blooming,
prior to end pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like the phloem could be
what's supporting these flowers really
[SPEAKER_02]: early in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually did this model,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to mention with different
assumptions about respiration,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I didn't have temporal
measurements of respiration during the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire span of floral development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you assume there was no
respiration, a handful of species came out
[SPEAKER_02]: as not having enough water in their phloem
to hydrate the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you put even a low rate of
respiration, there was maybe one,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was one species left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got a little bit higher,
there were none.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that the phloem should be
at least able to supply 60% of the water
[SPEAKER_02]: that these flowers need, possibly all of
the water they need during development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do these petals have stomates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they losing a lot of water from the
transpiration?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this work, I've been focusing on
just up into anthesis when they open.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one that I believe has stomates
is the magnolia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a graduate student actually
right now looking at floral loss through
[SPEAKER_02]: these different structures and what
happens after anthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think after that, after they
open and those petals are exposed,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole story changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, as I say, is just an ongoing
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mentioned before how my favorite
projects are the ones that lead to more
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this leaves a big question,
because I just gave you some tidbits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said the phloem seems active in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supplying carbon and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, this is really intriguing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants that flower early invest more
of their carbon the year before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tells me there's probably some
restriction on phloem transport in the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they don't have a big enough
window to transport, or maybe they're
[SPEAKER_02]: transporting at a slower rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is something that we're
currently looking in to try to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening in terms of transport
into these flowers in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that will come at a later time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll have more answers and more
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, just to wrap it up,
I hope I gave you a little bit of a hint
[SPEAKER_02]: of some of the cool questions that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I in no way claim to have answered this
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we are just scratching the surface
in terms of the connection between the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure and function in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we ended up with at the end of
all this is a lot of really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's anybody out here,
look at the cool research projects on the
[SPEAKER_02]: phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of them out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'd like to thank you for
your attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can take any questions that you
have.
Great.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're going back to the giant
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either, and if the radiophobic
synthesis is the same, then they either
[SPEAKER_01]: have bigger leaves or they have more
leaves, which suggests maybe they're
[SPEAKER_01]: branching more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one thing I know, so this is a
little complicated because most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants I was growing never got to the
size.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the greenhouse, you can't grow them as
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you grew a Hubbard
squash under the exact same conditions as
[SPEAKER_02]: a Atlanta giant in the field, whether it
would produce more.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the greenhouse, they were remarkably
similar, but they showed a big difference
[SPEAKER_02]: in their pattern of allocation to their
fruit in terms of how many fruits versus
[SPEAKER_02]: how big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it might be more of a trade-off at
that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But without actually growing the Hubbard
squash and pushing them to the extent that
[SPEAKER_02]: those Atlantic giants are pushed,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we could see at that scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that typical dominance
might be playing a real role.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the other thing they do,
there's a lot of practices that they do
[SPEAKER_02]: during giant pumpkin growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do a lot of very careful pruning
and maintenance and planning about the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant and how it is put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem that there is with these
field-grown ones is they all use the one
[SPEAKER_02]: variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to convince somebody to put that much
effort into doing an experiment of a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of different ones would be really
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could definitely believe that there's
something going on with typical dominance
[SPEAKER_02]: for branching, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: No,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I had an answer for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a while ago, I participated in a study
where we actually compiled a lot of data
[SPEAKER_02]: from the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to get an idea of how
variable sugar concentrations are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem that we have is there's a
lot of methods that people use for
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not clear how equivalent they
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of debate in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: About whether a particular study that
showed a really low or really high
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration is actually realistic should
always be in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the default is often in our models
to do what the average is, where we see
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also the concentration that's optimal
for transport in terms of viscosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, the work that I showed you
that Fisher showed of the seasonal changes
[SPEAKER_02]: shows that it does change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's likely not the same all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how much it differs between
species and how dynamic it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Janaro Fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering what other molecules you
measured with the transport, whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just carbon or whether you included
nutrients like potassium and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that are actively transported
in the phloem, to see if there was any
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between the carbon that was
transported and these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have RNA and all kinds of
other things that are moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any hints about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've focused primarily on carbon and
sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it's a really active and
interesting area of research with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are transported in the phloem
that have huge implications for how plants
[SPEAKER_02]: function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think it'd be a great thing to
look at more in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does gravity have an impact on
phloem transport?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've actually gotten different opinions
on this when I've talked to people who do
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the modeling and who study physics
in phloem transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, the thought is that it doesn't
matter a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to get really tall to
have it be a significant impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most plants, with the exception of
some of these really tall trees,
[SPEAKER_02]: do not have those really long different
distances between a source and a sink,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you would be tall enough that
gravity would have a big impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible that in really tall trees it
has some impact, but it's not clear to me
[SPEAKER_02]: how much of an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for one more question,
if there is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the different timing of
flowering in the same species.
Sometimes in horticultural products,
including granules, especially prunus,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have different times of leaving and
flowering within the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how the winter goes,
they can overlap or one has to go with the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea on what's going on
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I sort of present this as it being
black and white, and it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even for some of the species that I've
used, it seems to depend on even just the
[SPEAKER_02]: microenvironment they're growing in,
in addition to yearly variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much the flowers and leaves overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I talked all day about phloem,
but I've actually done a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_02]: xylem, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done a lot of work on xylem in
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like what's happening with
leaves is more tightly tied to what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in the xylem, and that the
flowers are disconnected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my guess is that the signaling is just
different, and depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, the flowers are more flexible
if the phloem is easier to reactivate,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is my suspicion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Xylem is usually reactivated later in a
lot of species, especially in cold
[SPEAKER_02]: climates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be that if they're able to
settle, separate themselves, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the xylem, I'd be relying on the
phloem that flowers are able to come out
[SPEAKER_02]: before leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would depend on the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd like to thank Jessica for a
fascinating lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
