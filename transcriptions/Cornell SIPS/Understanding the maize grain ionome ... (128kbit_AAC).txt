[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Margaret, for that wonderful
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one moment, I kind of almost cried,
because I was like, oh, gosh, I am going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of switching gears, I guess,
because like she mentioned, we have limits
[SPEAKER_00]: on our time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the topic's up there at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so basically, the green revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green revolution increased yields in
the crops that we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it selected down to very few crops
globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the costs of taking that focus
on a few crops and focusing on yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, meant there was actually a
reduction in the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral elements that we have in many of
the foods that we eat, and a reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in some of the foods in many of
the foods that we eat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that as well, there's an
increasing interest in the nutrition of
[SPEAKER_00]: the food that we eat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding interactions between
genetic and environmental factors is
[SPEAKER_00]: paramount to understanding nutritional
quality of the food that we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are various organizations that
provide information, such as the USDA and
[SPEAKER_00]: the World Health Organization,
that will provide information on the types
[SPEAKER_00]: and diversity of foods that we should in
order to attain the essential and
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial elements that we require in our
diet, so 22 mineral elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we have any reduction in this
diversity of food, we're expected to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a reduction in the amount of mineral
elements that we have in our diet as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would affect our health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from the USDA giving an idea
of the types and the quantities of food
[SPEAKER_00]: that we should eat in our diet in order to
get these mineral elements that we
[SPEAKER_00]: require.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we're aware, all around us,
we don't have to look too far to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some people, is this too loud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little too loud?
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some people that actually
don't get the types of diet that they
[SPEAKER_00]: require in order to get these minerals in
their diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Baltimore, there's a map here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the red here
represents food deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a food desert is defined by a lack of
one or more of these three elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three layers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one here is physical access
to healthy food, affordable healthy food,
[SPEAKER_00]: and desire and knowledge to eat healthily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to have any one of those
lacking in the area, geographical location
[SPEAKER_00]: that we live in, we would expect,
we may expect, that there would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility we'd have a reduction in the
healthy food that we can access and the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of mineral elements that we may
have in our diet as well, and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting our health as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also happens on a global scale as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a map of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the incidence of global zinc,
iron, vitamin A, and iodine deficiency in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at that very quick,
quick, brief look at that, it shows you
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are many countries around the
world with from mild to alarmingly high
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence of deficiency of these various
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that, considering just these
elements here, maybe one or more of these
[SPEAKER_00]: elements, about two billion people
globally are expected to be deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: one or more of these elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really important question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's easy to resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just supplementation is one of the easy
ways that we could actually just remove
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supplementation directly with tablets
is iron, for example, or supplementation
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant in fertilizer form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have foliar feeds and that type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another way may be fortification of
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we actually argue that
biofortification, so that's using the
[SPEAKER_00]: innate genetics of the plant, is a
sustainable and long term method approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually providing the right nutrients
to people that actually don't have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to the food in the right way that they
should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actual delivery of nutrients is potential,
especially to those people, the
[SPEAKER_00]: marginalized poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we consider people in Sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, for places around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world that actually don't have as much
access to the mineral elements that they
[SPEAKER_00]: might require for a healthy diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question then is, if we're going to
do that, what is it that we need to know
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to address this question?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from research in plants, we become
aware that genetics regulates the elements
[SPEAKER_00]: that go into the plants that we work with,
in the crops that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also aware that one of the other
factors of that is the soil type,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil pH, fertilization, and these
other factors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics here we've denoted as
uppercase G, and environment is denoted as
[SPEAKER_00]: uppercase E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound familiar guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's another element to this
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the interaction of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to briefly talk about some of
the genetics behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just talk about iron now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the path of iron through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we look in the rhizosphere,
and here we can see insoluble iron within
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere, which is being collated
and then passed through channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've highlighted this one channel
here, yellow stripe one, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about that a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the yellow stripe one,
we're going to take this path that takes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cellular and intracellular
pathways going past the casparian strip
[SPEAKER_00]: and then towards the xylem and the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the xylem, it will be taken up through
the plant and into places such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the leaves, because we're
dealing with iron now, which we need it as
[SPEAKER_00]: an essential element, but it's also toxic
in high levels, what we can do is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does is that something like the
N-ramp here will actually take that iron
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in two high quantities and actually
put that and store it in the vacuoles and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it safe from the other functions in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then continuing this passage up to the
parts of the plant that we eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we find that the iron will be in
those areas there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this whole process that really,
we know parts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've just explained it to you,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know parts of this process,
but there's also a lot that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we want to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What don't we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe let's talk a little bit about the
ironome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mineral nutrient and trace element
composition of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the definition of what an
ironome is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it comes from, it's like an
intermediate of two other terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, sorry about this,
it seems there was an incompatibility with
[SPEAKER_00]: the computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the metalome, if I say that correctly,
that's the inorganic metals within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is smaller than the ironome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the organic, low weight
molecules and inorganic metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the metabolome that maybe we're
more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the ironome then, is the
nutritionally relevant minerals and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we know that, so how can we
influence the mechanisms to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it we can really get in there and
understand the genetics in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it work for what we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is, is currently known
genes do not explain the whole story of
[SPEAKER_00]: elemental homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our solution on that, our take,
is we want to know the complete set.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it we get to know more of what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: The complete set to give a bigger part of
the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our method is using association
mapping on 20, sorry, 20 elements that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these 20, remember there was 22
elements for the, that we were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: essential elements earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at 20 of those though on
10 diverse environments and four different
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the complete thing that we're
looking at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gonna talk to you about just three
of these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may be looking at this going,
what on earth is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna just walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these squares represent on the
triangle, they represent the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that we find in each of these
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one over here is probably quite
familiar to most of you, is the nested
[SPEAKER_00]: association mapping panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the comments that I have in the middle
are kind of relative to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have, the NAM is expected to
have greater power than maybe the second
[SPEAKER_00]: maze diversity panel, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then great resolution and less
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maze diversity panel, the second one
here, is expected to have less power,
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical power, and greater resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And greater diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might be wondering why this square
is in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because some of the recombinant
inbred lines that we find in the NAM are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually also found in the diversity panel
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming to the third population over
here, the heterogeneous inbred families,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the square again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tells us that these HIFs are
actually created from the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these HIFs that we create are nearly
isogenic lines, which is a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different question than we were asking for
the first two populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna talk just very briefly about
the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be quick, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 NAM founders of reasonable diversity,
genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These 25 founder lines were all crossed
with B73.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selfed to the F6 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have 25 recombinant inbred
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within each family, we have 200 common
inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A total of 5,000 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would also be found in the
diversity panel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, so we're getting into some of the
data now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working in the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the NAM, we planted four different
locations, quite diverse locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in these locations, we're looking
at elemental accumulation by location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I've picked two random elements
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is manganese and one is molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the concentrations at each location
are seen in the box plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below that on the x-axis,
you can see the locations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But below that again, we have the pH,
the soil pH for each of those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to try and make life a little bit
easier for you, I've colored those by the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of accumulation of the availability
of that element that we would expect with
[SPEAKER_00]: a pH of that value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in North Carolina,
we have a pH of 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would expect for manganese to have a
low availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, in North Carolina, for
molybdenum, we would expect to have a poor
[SPEAKER_00]: availability again once there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: The data that we actually see is that the
concentrations for each of these within
[SPEAKER_00]: the kernel that we're taking here is
actually, we expect to have poor
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, but we don't have the lowest
for the kernel concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, for the manganese,
we don't have the lowest again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us that the concentrations
in the kernel are not tracking directly
[SPEAKER_00]: with pH that we see in the locations that
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us once again, there's
something else at play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I get to the point here,
the point is we believe it's the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that's at the greater proportion of this
that's spelling out the story for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the heritability,
broad sense heritability, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic contribution to the phenotype that
we're observing, when we look at these two
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bottom here, manganese and
molybdenum, we can see that their
[SPEAKER_00]: heritabilities are 0.6, which is a
reasonably high heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then let's look over to these other
ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that we have some others here,
0.3 or lower heritability, which tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually there's probably a greater
influence of the environment on that
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take that point home there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about the G and the E and
the G by E together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, great, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now what I want you to do is I
want to just take you on a little journey
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of preparing the data
for association analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just going to sort of talk
briefly about these, but get used to these
[SPEAKER_00]: slides because these slides will be coming
up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't have to talk through them
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give you the same type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that stands for is inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is is it will actually
record the concentration of the element
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're looking at and give us some raw
data and tell us how much of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for that, we sampled for the NAMM
roughly 50,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here we remove outliers using the
median absolute deviation, 2.5 standard
[SPEAKER_00]: deviations from the median.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we do a Box-Cox
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we do the best linear
unbiased predictors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically to correct the errors
in the data that we get for each line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did those four elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we get for each line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so then we moved on from here,
and we looked at joint linkage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is considered to be a more
conservative method of doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below that, we did association
mapping, genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for resolution within the genome,
we did approximately 29 million SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I put QTL-like rain, because
literally that's what it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get so many QTL, they're bursting out
of your ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where filtering comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the correct significance of the
threshold for filtering allows us to
[SPEAKER_00]: filter between the sunny QTL, the good
ones, and the thunderous QTL, the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that we process that and take that
data and then, so let's have a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our joint linkage, we have a lot of
linkage results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to bore you with too
many details here, but what we have here
[SPEAKER_00]: is individual locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So North Carolina, New York, Puerto Rico,
and Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these ones would be a QTL that's
found at multiple locations, so two or
[SPEAKER_00]: more locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right at the bottom here,
we have, so this is a subset of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 that we were looking at, but this is
all of them added together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that the numbers that we get for
individual locations are far higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers we get for multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also plays into the whole G by E
idea as well, that actually some QTL,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't explain everything across every
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some things only explain
specific things within one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's look at the GWAS as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, you know how I said it was
more liberal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting thousands here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then look at two or more locations,
29.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes you feel a little deflated
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so that's the results that we get
for the joint linkage in the GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's have a look at them a little bit
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have now is this is the joint
linkage in GWAS hits for manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything is overlapping now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had all these thousands of QTL,
but now what we have is not just
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands, but they're all stacking up
upon one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're actually starting to make sense
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're telling us a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is for manganese, and this
one's for molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we were getting so many
thousands of QTL that we were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what are we going to do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to sort of tell a story?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PI that we're working with,
Ivan Baxter, so his lab actually felt a
[SPEAKER_00]: good strategy to do would be to create
some software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is ZBrows that we're looking at
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a browser that you can use to
actually visualize many of these QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so the next one is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see how they're nicely stacking up
nicely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually really sort of look
down at the region of the chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: that's of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have a look at some of the genes
that are under some of these stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have just random selection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus, manganese, and molybdenum
on chromosomes nine and one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, once again, so we have the
sulfate transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was I was telling you about
earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: The N-RAMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we found the N-RAMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this story already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the MOT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I'm pulling these ones out
for you is because we know these stories
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can say to you, oh, well,
you know, we've got what we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, there's a lot we don't know
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of these thousands of QTL that we
got, they tell other stories that maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't expect at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about this one here a
little bit first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MOT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, MOT1 is one of our favorites because
it was originally found in Arabidopsis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mitochondrial envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was by the PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to like it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ivan Baxter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it was discovered by Josh Cobb
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the McCooch Lab in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the reason that we like it is
because MOT1 is a key regulator of
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it explains about 70% of the variance
that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So successful detection of MOT1 is used as
a quality check for the GWAS that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's so almost a qualitative
gene, that we're able to really,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we don't see that gene showing up in
our results, then we start to worry a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've looked at the NAM,
we need to think a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we learn from this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what adaptations do we need to improve
analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's necessary to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned that it's necessary to
increase statistical power in our
[SPEAKER_00]: association analysis, and then also to
increase the resolution as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at the maze diversity
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this big one in the middle
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting to have less power,
great resolution, and great diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted these in Florida,
Indiana, Missouri, New York, North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, and Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about increasing our
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was performed on approximately 83
million SNPs before filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we implemented a multi-locus
mixed model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in order to reduce false
discovery and increase power as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're back to this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the concentrations at
locations of iron and molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are our locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the green here is where we would
expect to see a good availability of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look up here, we can clearly
see that we're not getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's the lowest of all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look here for North Carolina again
at 4.5, okay, it's maybe one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about, explain for Florida as
well, cuz that's one of the lowest as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly something else is going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the genetic
contribution to the phenotypes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: observe, we see that in North Carolina,
New York, and Indiana, for iron and
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum, within locations, consistently
we're getting higher results for the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when we look across locations,
we're finding that it drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly we have no follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heritability is easy to explain
within location, but actually when we look
[SPEAKER_00]: across locations, we actually find that it
does less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as good as explaining the
phenotypes that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back to this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we're using here, we went from
blups and now we're using residuals
[SPEAKER_00]: because it allowed us to have better
normalization of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the top here, so we're gonna talk
about these in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top here, we implemented a,
I don't quite know how to say this because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of an odd thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna call it K-Chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I was advised to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's basically an adjustment for
population structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was implemented by Alex Lipka,
who's now at University of Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's alumni from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we implemented the MLM using the
K-Chair population structure adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did that in just straight MLMM
and then also in bootstraps of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect the bootstraps to be more
liberal and the regular G was to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have QTL again and we're doing
liberal and conservative filtering for
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that on the 83 million SNPs as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's look at some of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, what do we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for the bootstraps over here,
then individual locations through here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then looking just at the individual
locations where the two or more of those
[SPEAKER_00]: are observed in more than one,
sorry, two or more of those are observed
[SPEAKER_00]: in each of the individual locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for cadmium, phosphorus,
and zinc, we have these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then looking at the total numbers
across, for all of the elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting these really big numbers
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have 19 across all locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us then that we're getting
the same case again as we did previously
[SPEAKER_00]: in the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to really look and say,
well, how many did we get in the NAM?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many did we get in the diversity
panel that different?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here is on the y-axis,
we have all of the traits lined up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis, we're looking at the
numbers of QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the red is the diversity panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers of diversity panel QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blue ones are common to NAM
and the diversity panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look how ridiculously small it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point is, but that's kind of what
we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at different populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at different allelic
diversities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking in a way that we kind of
should have expected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because we're looking at these
different, broader genetic diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually mining a broader set of
lines that we hadn't actually looked at in
[SPEAKER_00]: the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, it actually confirms what
we'd thought in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at some of these genes again
under these peaks that we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have iron, cadmium, manganese,
and molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, do you remember way back in the
beginning when I was talking about yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: stripe one, when it goes into the root?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again, we have yellow stripe one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have these other ones that may be
less expected, but cutin biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with cadmium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can explain these away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinc transporter associated with manganese
may be less expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once again, our best friend,
Mott 1, has shown up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of those are actually not found in
the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a friend here, a qualitative friend
over here, is actually found in the NAM as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're finding that actually we're not
finding them in the NAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually finding them in the
diversity panel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing with zebras is that it
allows us to really drill deep into the,
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom into the areas where we can actually
see the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a peak of different SNPs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a gene that it probably is
associated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also one for manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this nice stack just sitting
directly on top of this gene here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to move on to the next
population now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the last one, so don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the hips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that, I'm going to just sort of
explain briefly how it is that we created
[SPEAKER_00]: the hips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this probably looks familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the NAM recombinant inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from those, by design,
we have a residual 3% heterozygosity
[SPEAKER_00]: across lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at QTL that we got from the
NAM, we're able to then say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're looking within this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to actually find some
heterozygosity that actually sits within
[SPEAKER_00]: that locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is that we looked
within a locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're able to detect heterozygous
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we select that one line that has that
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we plant it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we self it and plant it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look, do GBS, genotyping by
sequencing, on each of these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able then to select homozygotes
for that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have two and seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just random numbers that I picked here
that will actually allow us to find
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous opposing alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the two and seven up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see that they're different
at that loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we bulk those out, and then
disseminate them to the locations that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of the interesting
phenotypes that we observed in muskrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: if anybody's familiar with muskrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be expected because of the
interesting phenotypes associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: elements that we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what do we do with these HIFs
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted them in Florida,
Indiana, Missouri, New York, Texas,
[SPEAKER_00]: two locations in Simit and Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose of this, we expect that
the HIFs will reduce the genetic variance
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see between lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we believe that it will increase the
heritability of the traits that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we use the NAM-based QTL
for selection of the HIFs, like I
[SPEAKER_00]: explained already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, within each of these
locations, we have areas of differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really wanted to dig down into a
greater resolution within that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that reason, we also used haplotype
blocks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a zoom-in of all of the
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a subset that you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the haplotype blocks that we're
looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these red lines that you see
represent a haplotype block across the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each of these boxes represents a
QTL that we got from NAM when we did the
[SPEAKER_00]: NAM analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the one that we want to look at right
now, just as an example for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a cadmium QTL that we use to select
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's highlighted there in that
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really felt that the haplotype block
analysis will allow us to get greater
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution within the QTLs that we're
looking at for our selected lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, we go through this process
of preparing the phenotype data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working now with 2.9 million SNPs
for the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we're going to run a GWAS on
blocks, the haplotype blocks, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also GWAS on the individual SNPs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting the QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to be using the
intersection of those QTL in order to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a QTL of high interest, a significant QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for cadmium now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left, excuse me, on the left,
we have a QTL that is for blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right, we have SNP-based
QTLs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we're looking for the
intersection of both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, using ZBrows once again,
we're able to align all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: intersecting QTL that we get from the
blocks and the SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this one very clear peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we zoom in on that peak,
we find two subregions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is at 160 megabases, and the other
is at 176 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really wanted to know more about the
details of this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a clustering analysis on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we can see that we have three
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a trimodal distribution of
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for cluster one over here,
the green one, we found that we had a mean
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of cadmium for those alleles
of 4.82 milligrams a kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cluster two, that's the black one over
there, we had a mean of 27.78 milligrams a
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a difference of 23 milligrams a
kilogram there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the box plots at the bottom
here for each of those clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two and one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a test of significance between
these clusters, we're able to observe that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was actually a significant
difference between two and one,
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters two and one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a significant difference for
clusters three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So running the GWAS on individual
locations, that was able to tell us that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, we did all of these locations at
the top, but we only found those QTL in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, that tells us that so many
of our QTL are highly specific to specific
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that really does tell us it gives
us a greater idea about the G by E that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have we learned?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at three populations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've learned, going back to some
of the original questions that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: asking, what about biofortification?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're saying, it's if we really
want to do biofortification breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really need to understand the G by E
and the application of that using QTL that
[SPEAKER_00]: are applicable to specific locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GWAS helps us to understand the big
picture of homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can gain a knowledge of the complete
set of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing things, we're talking about
diversity and we get these QTL that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, we're getting
location-specific QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identify QTL for locally adapted
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also getting strong,
we can get strong multi-location QTL,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe we could have more success with
those ones for planting across multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: locations in different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for further investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this, what do we actually
get?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the story that we can tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the NAM, out of 19 of 20 of the
elements, we're getting more than 300 loci
[SPEAKER_00]: for each element.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that's missing there is selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Lily, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the diversity panel, we're getting
more than 250 loci per element,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's for all elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the HIFs, we found the
cadmium QTL and a possible modifier that
[SPEAKER_00]: was upstream at 176 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to put things to a
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank my committee
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who are they, you may be wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Margaret Smith, Owen Hokanga,
Ronnie's over there, and Lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sincerely, really, I might well up
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sincerely, for everything that you've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, I am willing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, and then I just want to say thank
you for the funding that I've received as
[SPEAKER_00]: well from the plant breeding section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've done, it feels like a huge
amount of TA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love TAing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, TAing loves me, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve Jash in molecular biology and
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also working with Larry Smart and
Michael Mazurek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also research funding from the
NSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the top here, our
collaborators, Ivan Baxter and Greg
[SPEAKER_00]: Zeigler, the guy that created Zebra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's his last name, that's the Z
bit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Danforth Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also Chad Myers and Rob Schaefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's another project that I haven't
actually talked to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was called a co-expression
browser that Rob Schaefer was working on
[SPEAKER_00]: as part of his PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how we've actually drilled
down to the gene level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of interested, well,
what's beyond that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that fit into a genetic pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the molecular mechanisms behind
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, as things are, as we look at
them at the moment, we're unable to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can guess, but we really want to sort
of drill down even further into
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that Rob was working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the timeline that I had in order to
finish up, it didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we also want to thank people
for germplasm and the planting locations
[SPEAKER_00]: that we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Texas, Seth Murray, Natalia
Palacios, and Aldo Rosales in Simit,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Gustin in Florida, Sherry Flynn
Garcia in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here at home, Cornell University,
Sherry Norman, Keith Payne, and Dan Fisher
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Korn project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to thank Denise Akdemir.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time was running out towards the end,
it was like, I've got to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was able to help me from the
statistical consultancy unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most but not least, where are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my beautiful wife and my
beautiful daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually sitting at the back here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you stand up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my wife, she's supporting me through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I didn't think I'd be so
emotional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
Just to be fair, we'd like to thank the
Mace Forestry Project for growing the NAM
for us.
We didn't have to grow the 5,000 microns
checks in four different sites.
We're very grateful that Ivan,
Chad, Rob, and I all thought about some
series with the Sherry's package.
That was a huge advantage.
And then also thanks to other people that
grew it to 82.
Thank you.
Thank you for the time on this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions, comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the exact criteria for deciding
whether two QTLs are the same across two
[SPEAKER_01]: local areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was meant to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for raising that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, when we were looking at the
NAM, the diversity panel, very often we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have snip, snip exactness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we did is we created a
2Kb window either side of the locus that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything that fell within that,
we considered it to be the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming that looking at Jason Wallace's
recent paper, looking about how within a
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 Kb window upstream or 10 Kb upstream
and downstream, we felt that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonably conservative method doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to open up on that question,
do you see a very small subset of QTLs
being able to resonate across multiple
locations?
Have you tried to compare and say what
qualifies a multi-efficient QTL versus the
vast majority that are location-specific?
Because that might tell you something
that's out of logic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, yeah, so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we'll need to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, based on our multi-location
QTL here at the moment, all it is is the
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL that we can actually find and detect
within one location, another location.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's exact hits, then we can call
them the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something we'll need to look
into at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see you're busting to ask me
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you partitioned as genetic and
environmental, sort of the factor,
[SPEAKER_02]: G cross E.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you also say that nature nurture,
phylogeny, autogeny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk to me later?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a rank amateur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose you could say that maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nature nurture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nature would be, what's the
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the nurture would be the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment that you're grown up in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many kernels do you use for each plot?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many kernels?
Kernels.
And do you think it would be better if we
were increasing the sample size?
[SPEAKER_00]: So regarding your last question,
the sample size, so that's not something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was actually involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that Greg Ziegler was
doing in the Danforth Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that they took something that
was a happy medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I in the right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to do an experiment,
you can get the NSF to actually pay for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, from the NAMM design,
that would be so easy to check if there
was more than 150 kernels.
So that's probably, I think we should be
shocked for five kernels per packet.
So that's very well replicated.
If you actually look at, well,
it was sampled in any given site.
It's not 5,000 kernels.
It's probably closer to 3,000 kernels.
Depends on who you germinate, who you
stick to, on the test, who you're
studying.
Yeah.
Deeper bit of an effect.
But actually, Baxter did a power analysis.
But we're iterating the brands and NSF to
focus on the stuff that we're not
assembling.
And so you can actually look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're about out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
