[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for the generous
introduction and good afternoon,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So today I'm going to be talking about
part of my PhD thesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call this part one because I'm hoping
that you will come back for my exit
[SPEAKER_04]: seminar, which will be part two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to be looking at
contrasting environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by way of outline, I'm going to be
talking about Kusaba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully by now, Kusaba is a very
familiar crop because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: research ongoing at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be talking about Kusaba flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you an overview of my thesis,
and then I'll talk about the main results
[SPEAKER_04]: from my experiment, from part of my work
I'm sharing today, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: summarize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, Kusaba is a big food
security crop, particularly in Africa,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also it's used as feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: They export most of this to Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because the tuber is almost 100
percent starch, you can see this in the
[SPEAKER_04]: background, it's almost 100 percent
starch, it has a lot of industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is why Kusaba is a very important
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in addition to this, just a little bit
about biology of Kusaba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kusaba is part of the Euphobesia family,
and it's a perennial shrub.
[SPEAKER_04]: The center of origin is in the Amazon,
so that's South America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed you, I think this is just a fun
slide of the numerous kind of things that
[SPEAKER_04]: we can get from Kusaba by way of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is fufu, it's a fermented Kusaba.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is gari, fermented or roasted Kusaba.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can also, some parts of
Africa, the leaves are also used as a
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetable like spinach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kusaba grows in the tropical regions of
the world, and so you see this distributed
[SPEAKER_04]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The latitude is represented here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a large proportion of that production
takes place in sub-Saharan Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this kind of gives you a reason why
it's a huge security crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally in sub-Saharan Africa,
Kusaba is grown as an insurance against
[SPEAKER_04]: total crop failure because it can survive
on marginal soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if all else fails, Kusaba will survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have it growing on the side in many
farmers' plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what a plant looks like on the
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to talk some more about the
morphology as I progress in this slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why Kusaba flowers?
[SPEAKER_04]: The harvesting part of Kusaba is the
tubers, so the flowers are not end-gold as
[SPEAKER_04]: it were.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why we need flowers is because
of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't, well, there are many ways to
breed right now, but flowers are important
[SPEAKER_04]: instruments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your breeding cycle or the success of
your breeding program rises and falls on
[SPEAKER_04]: the availability or the success of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is why flowers are important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's mainly because of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I was aligning some of the problems
with Kusaba flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you go all through the development
of the reproductive phases, you have
[SPEAKER_04]: different kind of problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in genotypes, particularly the ones the
breeders would love to work with is late.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you do go through eventually
inducing flowers, development could be
[SPEAKER_04]: arrested prematurely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So an example here, way before un-pieces
were caused, the flowers are aborted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you succeed in the time and the
development of flowers, the sex ratio
[SPEAKER_04]: would be another problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 90% males compared to females.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that females are going to be
the seeds that the breeders will work
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you succeed in this too,
you're going to have a problem here when
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have sufficient females to work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is because Kusaba is an
outcrossing species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you succeed through one,
two, three, you can also have problems in
[SPEAKER_04]: seed set.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that you have females to work
with doesn't guarantee there was a set
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the result of all of this is your
breeding is suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you end up skewing your breeding
to just the genotypes that are able to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce flowers you can work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: From our studies here in the Sutter Lab at
Cornell University, there are a number of
[SPEAKER_04]: things we've learned about Kusaba.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you details about each of
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've learned definitively that Kusaba is
a long-based flowering time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also learned about the special type
of branching that is associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: reproductive development.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also learned about the temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs more directly cool temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of my work focuses on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll talk about the... We've
also learned that the flourishing as in
[SPEAKER_04]: other species, flowering locus T is
involved in regulation of flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to describe what forking looks like in
Kusaba, I have this model here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to walk you through it and show
you some description of how flowering
[SPEAKER_04]: takes place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, on the y-axis,
I have the percent of plant flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually from data, just a bunch
of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made this up with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the number of days to the first
flowering event could vary by genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some could be really early,
some could be very late.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after the first forking event or the
first flowering event, you have a period
[SPEAKER_04]: of vegetative growth and then it moves to
the second and to the third.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want you to keep this in mind when I
talk about tier one, two, or three,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about flowering events.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first event, second event and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: By way of the way, by way of how the plant
grows, this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this particular line, this is going
to be an example of a good flowering line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have initial vegetative growth and
then you have this fourth high branch in
[SPEAKER_04]: any fluorescence in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this would be the first tier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have a second tier and they can
go out and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some genotypes don't have as good
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only succeed in just having one
flowering event and some genotypes just
[SPEAKER_04]: never flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for us, this is why the biology of
cassava flowering is important because in
[SPEAKER_04]: such genotypes, there are a lot of traits,
maybe resistance or high yield or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's locked up in this kind of genotype
and you cannot include it in your breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle because it's good you don't have
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is one of the reasons why our
study is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still giving you some details about the
morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about a special type of
branching.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to distinguish this from other
types of branching that can occur in
[SPEAKER_04]: cassava.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have lateral branches like so,
but this is different from the fork type
[SPEAKER_04]: branching.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fork type branching is reproductive
branching.
[SPEAKER_04]: With lateral branches, you can decapitate
the plant and the buds on the plants are
[SPEAKER_04]: activated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get this at any point in the
growth of cassava, but this is different
[SPEAKER_04]: from the fork type branching.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only happens when the plant is
transitioning from vegetative to
[SPEAKER_04]: reproductive phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you the cassava is a long day plant
from our studies here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some data to just support this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see all across this table,
only at long days do you have some
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: At short days, you really wouldn't have
any flowering and the age to flower also
[SPEAKER_04]: corresponds with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you also that flourishing FT is
involved in flowering and we can see this
[SPEAKER_04]: response when we grow the plants under
long day conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly FT2 is responsive to the long
day for the period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where I begin my study.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see here that at cooler
temperatures, you have a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering and it's possible that at warmer
temperatures, you have no flowering at
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have slight improvement in the days to
flowering, in the age at which flowering
occurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the temperature is cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my PhD thesis, this is like a lot of
things to a lot of information to work
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I kind of decided that I'm going
to contribute to flowering in three
[SPEAKER_04]: phases.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to look at the abiotic
environments to look at the growth of
[SPEAKER_04]: hormones in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also I hope that will give us some
information on cassava flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: For today, I'm only focusing on the
abiotic environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: This other two, I hope to come for my next
seminar and then give you more information
[SPEAKER_04]: about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically in Ibadan, there's been this
story that there are two locations in
[SPEAKER_04]: Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Ibadan and Ubi Aja.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the dogma is everything that you take
Ubi Aja flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So breeding programs both from IIT and
Ibadan from Umudike.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come to Ubi Aja to make their crosses
because for reasons which no one could say
[SPEAKER_04]: previously the Ubi Aja environment favors
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is some of the historical data I
was able to lay my hands on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that Ubi Aja is earlier
than Ibadan in terms of its flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my job, my interest was to find out
what the underlying biology in this
[SPEAKER_04]: genotype by environment interaction was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also hopefully that will provide us
some insight that we can begin to suggest
[SPEAKER_04]: ways to intervene and to improve cassava
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did was, so from IIT inventing to
several hundred genotype population called
[SPEAKER_04]: the genetic gain population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I selected genotypes based on the data
that they had in three categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: So genotypes that were between 30 and 60
days, like mastodias, that's like any
[SPEAKER_04]: category.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mid category was 60 to 90 days and my
late category where genotypes were over 90
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I can't work with a several
hundred genotypes so I made a soft
[SPEAKER_04]: selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I planted these simultaneously in both
location and I observed the physiology of
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants and also I was collecting data
on the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing is temperature and from
the data I collected in 2017, what we
[SPEAKER_04]: learned is Ibadan consistently led Ubi Aja
in temperature, so Ibadan was a warmer
[SPEAKER_04]: location.
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice in month one and in the fourth
month you have like this huge difference
[SPEAKER_04]: in the, well maybe not huge, but you have
a difference in the maximum temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want you to bear that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also able to collect rainfall data
and Ubi Aja turns out to be wetter than
[SPEAKER_04]: Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly explaining why it's cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to remember that Nigeria is a
tropical country so day length is not a
[SPEAKER_04]: factor because day length doesn't change
as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only reason why it would be cooler
is not because of snow but because of
[SPEAKER_04]: rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the physiology of the plant,
looking at plant height as an index for
[SPEAKER_04]: plant growth in its locations,
indeed the plants grew better in Ibadan
[SPEAKER_04]: compared to Ubi Aja.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to remind you that from
the previous slides we talked about the
[SPEAKER_04]: weather and Ibadan is warmer but it's not
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's sufficient rainfall to show
that it's not drought stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's possible that the growing
conditions in Ibadan favors photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_04]: so you have more biomass production and
that is why plant growth is much more than
[SPEAKER_04]: in Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_04]: This pattern was also true for shoot
biomass and root wheat but I'm not showing
[SPEAKER_04]: that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we don't see any evidence for a
genotype by environment interaction
[SPEAKER_04]: because the same rank maintained sort of
the same rank maintained in Ibadan except
[SPEAKER_04]: for a few genotypes is kind of maintained
in Ubi Aja.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in flowering time, the story is
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used a number of notes to fork in
because this is a kind of a developmental
[SPEAKER_04]: time score.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our redopsis, we used number of reset
leaves as an index for the age at which
[SPEAKER_04]: plants flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used a number of notes to fork in
partly because these doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of determined.
[SPEAKER_04]: So however, whenever you come to score,
it's when it's determined is determined.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a much more objective trait to
use than the chronological age of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we see the genotype by environment
interaction being how it plays out here
[SPEAKER_04]: for some is strong, for some it's not so
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all genotypes were earlier in Ubi Aja
than in Ibadan supporting historical data
[SPEAKER_04]: that we had that Ubi Aja genotypes are
usually earlier in Ubi Aja.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, some of them,
there was almost no difference like they
[SPEAKER_04]: were almost on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was almost identical in the two
location.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that these genotypes that
behave this way happen to be the genotypes
[SPEAKER_04]: I have selected to be in my early
category.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at this idea, I compared the two
locations and I was asking the question
[SPEAKER_04]: whether some genotype, whether this change
was as fairly significant or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this placed the genotypes into
different categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: A category which I will describe as
plastic and these genotypes with different
[SPEAKER_04]: differences meaning the change and time to
flower in its location was significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas those that I will describe as
non-plastic, I wish the change was not as
[SPEAKER_04]: significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to pause here to define plasticity
just in the interest of those who may know
[SPEAKER_04]: the biologists as the response of living
organisms to the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plastic genotype means that
they are responding very strongly to the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment while the non-plastic genotype
sort of may be insensitive to the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The result I saw from my own study made me
to go back to the historical data I had
[SPEAKER_04]: access to from Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was data collected between 2013
and 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to see how plasticity plays
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have no support because that was
something I introduced when I started my
[SPEAKER_04]: own study.
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead I had the chronological ages
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we see, what I did here was
essentially to take the difference between
[SPEAKER_04]: the mean days of flowering of the
genotypes in Ibadan and Oviatcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the genotypes were later in
Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them were stable and all
non-plastic while a few of them were the
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: The non-stable line, I defined my
threshold for stability as lines that had
[SPEAKER_04]: no more than three days difference in the
flowering time between the two locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is like something like a way for
me to begin to think about the biology of
[SPEAKER_04]: what is going on in two locations,
not just one location is earlier than the
[SPEAKER_04]: other, but to see that there is this
interaction with the environment that each
[SPEAKER_04]: of the genotypes can behave differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So zooming in more detail, I took a
representative member of the plastic group
[SPEAKER_04]: and a representative member of the
non-plastic group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on your left hand, you have the data
from number of nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm showing here is something a
little more advanced beyond just the time
[SPEAKER_04]: to initial flower induction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have here what happens over the course
of three tiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the first genotype, this genotype,
which is the same as the non-plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: genotype, you see that the pattern of
flowering is similar in the two locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same, but in the plastic genotype,
the pattern of flowering for the three
[SPEAKER_04]: tiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is tier one, two and three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember I described the 14 events.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have this difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, if you compare each of
the genotypes in a vertical way,
[SPEAKER_04]: so like looking at each location
separately, you see that it's ubiagea,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a favorable environment,
has a similar pattern in the non-plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: and the plastic genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm taking that to reflect what is
going on here, that there's a sort of a
[SPEAKER_04]: convergence or similarity between the two
genotypes in ubiagea.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at the other direction,
the unfavorable location, you can see a
[SPEAKER_04]: huge difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I should say more about this,
moving the time to move from one flowering
[SPEAKER_04]: event or like one tier to the other in the
unfavorable environment expands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the proportion of plants that are
able to have subsequent reproductive
[SPEAKER_04]: phases gets lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually it's completely shut down in
the plastic genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these was a interesting thing that I
decided to dig a little more into the
[SPEAKER_04]: biology of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before this, from the genotypes I had
on the field, I shipped a number of them
[SPEAKER_04]: to Ithaca so that we could do control
studies on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with Peter's help, I was able to get
this running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the field, these are genotypes from
the field, so I'll walk you through
[SPEAKER_04]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have the blue and orange line
represents plastic genotypes, those that
[SPEAKER_04]: respond to the environment, while the
green line is representative non-plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under control conditions, we had three
temperatures, 22, 28, and 34 degrees
[SPEAKER_04]: daytime temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see as this resembles the field a
lot, that the plastic genotypes on the
[SPEAKER_04]: field were very, very temperature
responsive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So meaning that as the temperature got
higher, the days to flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: the time to flowering also increased.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the non-plastic genotype was
almost temperature insensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I know you might say,
oh, they didn't follow exactly the same
[SPEAKER_04]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue is not quite as steep as the
orange in both locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just an idea to begin to help us
to think about what is happening on the
[SPEAKER_04]: field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So remember, the field is not just one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot reduce field conditions to be
just temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is kind of showing evidence that
the thing going on on the field might be
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature related.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to this, previously from our
lab, we had also done a previous member of
[SPEAKER_04]: our lab, Sarah Deyemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: She had overexpressed iridopsis FT.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found out that that improved
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took the two genotypes in question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the wild type, 60444, it's a South
American line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a late flowering genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope after this presentation,
we would redefine what late means.
[SPEAKER_04]: So late would be in reference to a
particular environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the transgenic line, which
carries the overexpression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like before, the wild type had a
lot of plasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to draw your attention to the fact
that this horizontal line here doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: mean that it no longer responded to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because in the growth chamber,
we couldn't grow beyond 180 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to truncate the experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's possible if we had enough space
and kept it going, we could have seen this
[SPEAKER_04]: line grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the overexpression line was sort
of insensitive to the temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So based on this information, I proposed
two models of what is going on in Java
[SPEAKER_04]: with respect to plasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first model, I'm suggesting that in a
non-plastic genotype, a lot depends on the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics of the plant itself, while the
environment contributes very little.
[SPEAKER_04]: My hypothesis is that in the non-plastic
genotype, sufficient flourigen or
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering stimulus is produced such that
the environment doesn't affect it much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the quantity of flourigen that it
produces is able to counteract the
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-flourigen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's able to progress to flowering
type, independent of the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Arabidopsis, there is the autonomous
flowering pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can begin conversations about how
this might connect to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas in the plastic genotype,
flowering time depends heavily on the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment to facilitate one of three
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The environment can either increase the
flourigen, such as in the favorable
[SPEAKER_04]: environments, increase the flourigen so
that it's able to counteract the
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-flourigen and then have flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the unfavorable environment may
not do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also do the reverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be that it's not just the
flourigen, which is the flourigen stimulus
[SPEAKER_04]: that is changing, but the suppressant of
flourigen, so that's the anti-flourigen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, we can also propose that the two
are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we provide the favorable environment,
a lot of flourigen is produced,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in an unfavorable environment,
the reverse happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is sort of what I'm proposing that
is potentially going on in the plastic and
[SPEAKER_04]: non-plastic genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Sarah, also in our lab, had already
done some studies on temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Previously, I showed you that the FT2,
in particular, was responsive to
[SPEAKER_04]: photoperiods.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at long days, you had more FT
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she was also interested to see how
temperature affected this FT.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to connect what she did to some
of what I'm finding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the stable line, we don't have any
evidence that the temperature is affecting
[SPEAKER_04]: the FT expression in the correct
direction, because at lower temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: you should expect higher FT expression
compared to warmer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible that, I'm speculating,
that because this line is a non-plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: line, it doesn't depend on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what the environment is doing to
the FT expression may or may not have any
[SPEAKER_04]: bearing on the phenotype, which is
flourigen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas in the plastic genotype,
in the FT1, there is no evidence for the
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no evidence that this is
temperature responsive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But FT2 shows some.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can argue about how strong this
evidence is, but at least there is some
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence that at cooler temperatures,
there are higher FT2 expression compared
[SPEAKER_04]: to warmer temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just the aspects we have for
flourigen, but we don't have any
[SPEAKER_04]: information on the anti-flourigen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was interested in doing a more global
study of using these two genotypes so that
[SPEAKER_04]: we could get some information on the
anti-flourigen as well as the flourigen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just quickly, many people know about
RNA-seq, but RNA-seq just gives us a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: genome expression profile and allows for
communication and identification of the
[SPEAKER_04]: blood transcript.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used the RL3-prime RNA-seq method,
which was cost-effective, and RNA is
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse transcribed to cDNA and then
secreted to RL3-prime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to remind you quickly that
Ibadon was in favor of relocation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and earlier the temperatures in Ibadon
were warmer than Ubeja.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had two genotypes of plastic,
representative plastic and non-plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an unfavorable location,
and I took two time points.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one was my representative juvenile
phase, 30 days after planting,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I took seven days after forigen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at a stage where I will show that
flourigen or transition to production,
[SPEAKER_04]: to reductively extract RNA in Nigeria,
ship it to Ithaca, need some more
[SPEAKER_04]: processing, like purification and so on,
and sequence that biotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the help of Yihao and Hugh,
I would say we got some of the statistics
[SPEAKER_04]: ongoing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a double-centered PCA
methodology, which Hugh can give more
[SPEAKER_04]: information about how that is done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, the main contrast is shown
on the abscissa, on the x-axis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we see there's a class sorting out
between the two genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the blue genotype, we see that the two
look the open versus the closed,
[SPEAKER_04]: open versus the closed is separated into
two different segments of the PCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I should mention that the
double-centered PCA works with the
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions, not just the individual
elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the interaction of the samples and the
genes and the expression values.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that there's a class sorting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So meaning that in this genotype,
just as we've seen in the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a class sorting into the distinct
behavior of the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of the biotech adjoints and all of
the UBI just went into different
[SPEAKER_04]: components.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the non-plastic genotype,
he didn't have that clearly sorted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what he's saying is that the
developmental stage is a stronger role in
[SPEAKER_04]: the non-plastic genotype, which makes
sense because if you sample at two
[SPEAKER_04]: different ages, you expect class to be
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking also at the food change,
I took the reproductive phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as an example, there is more
information about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can come up with it before to illustrate
what is going on just for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_04]: the seminar.
[SPEAKER_04]: At seven days post-forking, which is when
the plants all transition to reproductive
[SPEAKER_04]: phase, you can see that in the non-plastic
genotype between the two locations,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's very little change in the
expression or in the way the two
[SPEAKER_04]: locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas in the non-plastic genotype,
you have a lot of difference in signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are things that we can even begin
to dig in further to look at what is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening, what pathways are involved and
so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to summarize right now and I
am saying that on the field, the
[SPEAKER_04]: plasticity on the response with the
genotype by environment interaction we see
[SPEAKER_04]: on the field is related to temperature and
that's why we favor flowering is related
[SPEAKER_04]: to cooler temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've also seen that at cooler
temperatures, the flowering time converges
[SPEAKER_04]: irrespective of the genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: In plastic genotype, warmer temperatures
delay flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when there's high expression of FT,
we are able to reverse this plasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our gene expression profile shows it's
able to distinguish the plastic from the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something I'm still going to
look in more details that warmer
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature might stimulate the expression
of the anti-flowering which might explain
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the plasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the end of my PhD, so I talked about,
I told you that I'm doing the,
[SPEAKER_04]: today I'm focusing on the abiotic
environment and I'm going to do much more
[SPEAKER_04]: work on this in the days to come and then
I'm going to complete analysis and
[SPEAKER_04]: interpretation of data on the cytokine and
sugar status.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to acknowledge the many people who
have helped me there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This slide does not do justice to all the
people who have helped me at the cost of
[SPEAKER_04]: my journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to acknowledge my PhD
committee, the members of our lab both
[SPEAKER_04]: present and past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a lot of help from Li Hao and Piu on
the RC data analysis, my collaborators in
[SPEAKER_04]: Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a wonderful field time, particularly
here, to see my field assistant has become
[SPEAKER_04]: more than just an assistant who is much
more like a friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of undergrads helped me with my
phenotypic scoring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this doesn't capture all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had several rounds of undergrads working
with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a small grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't underestimate what small
grants can do to your research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then funding that received from IIT is
support by field spaces, an exchange with
[SPEAKER_04]: the Bill Amandar Gates Foundation and of
course the government of Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually going is how we say thank you
in my language and open to questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: You indicated that the flowering,
the evidence says that the flowering is
[SPEAKER_02]: better when it's cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any suppositions as to why
it's better when it's cooler?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's kind of the whole goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The model I showed was it's possible that
at cooler temperatures, there's more
[SPEAKER_04]: inductive signal being produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is able to counteract the entry
signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's essentially my argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: From an evolutionary perspective,
how would something like that come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you think the thing is that's
in the environment that would encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: that type of?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stretching, I know, asking a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I would attempt, but it may not
be satisfied too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking at a tropical species here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One way you could think about it is that
the cooler temperature is not favorable
[SPEAKER_04]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it misaccelerates reproduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that it's life is, it continues
succeeding in the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it senses that it's getting
cooler, let's quickly reproduce so that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can continue our lineage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a tropical plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a temperate species, you have
mineralization, which is sensing when
[SPEAKER_04]: winter is going to end so that
reproduction can take place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the way I think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everything the plant would do is to
favor its reproduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if it noticed that something is
going to affect its succession,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would quickly reproduce before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a sense, it's a stress response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like we have mass years with
acorns and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a bad year, and the year after,
they have an abundance of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you thinking it's something along
that line?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe just being ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you look at winter versus
spring, it's just that the resources that
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to be available in spring is
going to be abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to flower so we can make the
most of the resources available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really that we are scared that we're
going to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's looking for an advantage rather
than avoiding the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in our case, I have this thought
that when rain begins, my thought is also
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere along the line that there's more
abundance of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plants can distribute pollen
more efficiently using water, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: or growth is going to be improved and so
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed a plot of this differential
between the body and the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's what I'm trying to think
about, what data we have in projects that
[SPEAKER_02]: would, yeah, that would.
So all of these genotypes have been
sequenced or genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the days of flowering is not
something that the readers would usually
[SPEAKER_02]: take, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you probably know, since you're part of
NextGen, you probably knew there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: GWAS of flowering time that was done at
some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of that data is not existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they look for low-side that
specifically interacted with location?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That were affected by this plasticity
ability?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plasticity was kind of my idea
about how to look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know from that study, we had a lot
of small effect QTLs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really spread out so much that
we cannot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flowering is an environmental trait,
like a trait that is... The QTLs we found,
[SPEAKER_04]: they found was possibly just
environmental.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a PhD candidate from the
University of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was her work.
And she examined, this was her work,
three years of study about the age of 700
to 1 population.
And she identified QTLs for flowering.
I do not remember any effort to try to
separate it out or to look at CYB between
the two locations.
I also remind you of your postdoc.
Also, work was done on this project.
And that hasn't been published yet.
So maybe you can see something wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I actually have one experiment in which
I looked at that study.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my speculation based on my result
is that it's sort of independent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're thinking about potatoes
because the flourigen signal influences
[SPEAKER_04]: stabilization as well as flower induction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember that potatoes is a modified
stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us cassava is a true root.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the floam, the way the floam is
arranged in the stem is not quite the same
[SPEAKER_04]: as in the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: FT is reduced and transported through the
floam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those are kind of where my thoughts
are going.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my data kind of suggests it's
independent, but not conclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if there are no more questions,
let's thank them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
