[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so I am Terry Bates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the director of the Cornell Lake Erie
Research and Extension Lab in Western New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are about as far in the Western
Empire of Cornell as you can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: still be in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have a map that I'll show you
where we're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about what we
call the Efficient Vineyard Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That building there, that is the Cornell
Lake Erie Research and Extension Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has actually been in Western New
York working with the ag industries,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the fruit production and
especially grape production in Western New
[SPEAKER_00]: York for about 110 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been several different labs in
that Western New York area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent one was in Fredonia,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were there from about the mid 50s until
2009 when we built the new building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked, how did you get the money
to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was from both the industry and
primarily from Senator Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was in our district and head of the
Senate Ag Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a long time desire for the
industry to have a new lab facility
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated for research and Penn State as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Lake Erie Regional Grape
Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extension program is a two state,
two university cooperative effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the only ones that's out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the people that are in this
photo, so I'd like to acknowledge the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that I work with at Claryl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say Claryl, Cornell Lake Erie
Research and Extension Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Claryl, not the hair care product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a mix of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them work for the Lake Erie
Regional Grape Program extension team
[SPEAKER_00]: headed by Tim Weigel, who's a New York
State grape IPM specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Cornell Agritech employees
there that help us run the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are other scientists that
are actually employed through the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: funded SCRI project, which we now call the
Efficient Vineyard Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the Efficient Vineyard Project
all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read this sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to show you a couple of
slides and read the sentence again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, it'll make more sense to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally today, I'll be talking about
precision ag, precision ag technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use in the grape industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a broad sense, talking about
precision ag, but in a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, trying to answer some of the
questions for our grape industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of the project is to develop
multiple sensing and automation solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: for measuring vineyard soil, canopy,
and crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that and reconstitute
those for high resolution spatial crop
[SPEAKER_00]: load management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to explain very specifically what
we're trying to get at in terms of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: load and how that impacts our grape
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm from Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Erie, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this strip of purple that you see are
all the grape vineyards that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a majority of the grapes that are grown
in New York are in that belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talk a lot about the Finger Lakes,
since you're so close to this region,
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Island, Lake Champlain region,
different grape growing areas in Western
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Western New York, we have this lake
plain right up against Lake Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're influenced by the lake effect
that we get from Lake Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moderates our temperature in the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we can grow tender fruit
production in Grape State, one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that expanded out to all of the Great
Lakes, so we have a primary influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: Lake Erie on our grape growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, and this is something that
Stan Howell from Michigan State used to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me, is that we have a broader
influence of all the Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as those cold air masses come down from
Canada, it crosses all that water,
[SPEAKER_00]: that air gets conditioned, and that's why
we can grow tender fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't get that cold in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have frost-free days in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was that increase in
elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the Allegheny Plateau,
the Escarbent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys on the weather channels call it
the Chautauqua Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Chautauqua County.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chautauqua County.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chautauqua Ridge, that rise in
elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about lake effect snow,
we get all the lake effect snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not uncommon for our region
down on the lake plain to get over 100
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of snow a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go up that hill, they get about 200
inches of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just shows you that lake
influence that we have in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the Concord industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big reasons I actually even
have a position at Cornell is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord juice grape industry in Western
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hear about Welches or you go to
Wegmans and you buy Wegmans Concord grape
[SPEAKER_00]: jelly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New York State, and I do cheat here
a little bit because this piece of the pie
[SPEAKER_00]: does include the Concord vineyards that
are in Pennsylvania as well, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down closer to Erie, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So majority of the grapes grown in New
York are Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talk about all the wineries that
are in the Finger Lakes and Long Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually make up a small percentage
of the total production of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're different markets too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord, we deal on an international
market, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welches is trying to out-compete with
Orange Juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Juice and Apple Juice, and there's
that economic impact there where most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the wineries are very successfully selling
all their product out the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Concord is very big, but it has very
low profit margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the price paid for
Concord compared to other wine grape
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties in the state, we're bottom
dollar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: About $200 a ton, where Riesling might be
getting $1,000 or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our growers have low profit margins and
we have become increasingly mechanized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's my specific problem that
we're gonna try to answer with general
[SPEAKER_00]: precision agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Concord growers, they grow a lot
of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just say, oh, Concord's not
making any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna start growing Traminette,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If one Concord grower with 200 acres
plants at all the Traminette, we've just
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded the Traminette market for the rest
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of stuck with Concord as an
industry and we're trying, we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rock bottom dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them to make a profit, they have to
become more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting more mechanized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept that they have adopted in
our industry is that we leave more
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting buds than the vines can handle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna set a very high crop potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I wanna make money is to have high
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to set that high crop potential by
leaving more fruiting buds than I need,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I get past frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those shoots come out, those shoots
have clusters on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get frost, that reduces the crop
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So risk management strategy against mother
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave more fruiting buds than I
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get past the threat of spring
frost, I can assess, do I want all those
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting shoots out there or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use mechanical shoot thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is mechanical pruner for
grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say over 50% of our vineyards
now at least do some kind of mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-pruning with a hand follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, leave more buds than we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can assess how many fruiting
shoots we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna reduce those throughout the
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot positioning is a canopy management
process we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we use a mechanical grape
harvester to thin fruit in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season to try to match the crop with
the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also use that, again,
that mechanical harvester during harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time to pick the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing, uniform management
and non-uniform system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using all these machines
uniformly across the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take my mechanical pruner or my
mechanical shoot thinner and I just set
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine up to do one thing and the
grower drives up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing with the precision ag
is use spatial data to talk to these
[SPEAKER_00]: machines and make the machines either
speed up or slow down as it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the vineyard to reach our crop
load balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what do I need by crop load?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a model based on 100 years of
research that was mostly labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about crop load as a Rivas
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something very specific to us,
crop mass to pruning mass ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we mean by pruning mass?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the winter, so one of a very labor
intensive but fairly accurate way of
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring how much vegetation the plant
grew the year before and what its cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: potential is for the next year is to
measure that through pruning weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because pruning weight is directly related
to leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting down to a horticulture
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, water and nutrient availability and
the ability of that plant to pick up water
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients will impart vigor on the vine,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much light interception per unit
land area we're getting translates to
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and we actually measure that
as pruning weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we measure leaf area directly?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should, we don't, it's difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to do it through pruning
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop weight is also something that is crop
estimated in animation and trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, total crop weight's gonna be at the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to answer that with sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say in that sentence,
I wanna measure spatially soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning weight and crop weight
characteristics spatially throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting all of those things into my
crop load model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a crop load model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna talk for three sessions
about this but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me summarize by saying an over-cropped
vine is bad, an under-cropped vine is bad
[SPEAKER_00]: and a balanced vine is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And horticulturists across the world talk
about vine balance or vineyard balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it really is saying is I wanna match
my crop size with the amount of leaf area
[SPEAKER_00]: I have out there and with my growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really have this down with Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I leave more crop than I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: At about 30 days after bloom, I'm
assessing what my season is and what my
[SPEAKER_00]: crop size is and I'm adjusting that crop
to match this crop load ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tend to, again, over-crop our
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leave way too much fruit and then we
try to dial it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're playing up here in the over-crop
situation and we try to bring them into
[SPEAKER_00]: balance with our machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to develop multiple sensing automation
solutions for soil, canopy and crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: then reconstitute those with our machines
to do very great applications to hit our
[SPEAKER_00]: crop load balance within the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have a viticulturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three guys walk into a bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A viticulturist, a robotics engineer and a
precision ag specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all start talking about different
things which they're really talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things about this large
SCRI, USDA funded project we had is
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-disciplinary and trying to get
people in the same room talking the same
[SPEAKER_00]: language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come up with this measure model
manage or sense plan ag data information
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of these guys is talking about
something a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really talking the same language.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna measure soil, canopy and crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna model what our crop load is and
then we wanna manage that through
[SPEAKER_00]: vectorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we break the project down into measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, soil, canopy and crop sensors
and validation of those sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna hear me say validation a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take an NDVI sensor which we use to
try to get an assessment of canopy growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and light interception, that NDVI sensor
is just giving me an electric signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving me this colorful heat map that
just, I don't know what 0.7 NDVI really
[SPEAKER_00]: translates to viticulturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go out and we do stratified manual
samples in the vineyard against our sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements to translate that NDVI signal
into a pruning weight map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that means something to me as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of modeling, so multi-data layer
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really, I look at modeling in
two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is how do we make the most out of the
spatial data?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of noise in the spatial
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of natural variation from
vine to vine in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to pull out what the
underlying growth pattern is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to process that spatial
data to try to pull that information out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I explained, we're trying to
also model crop load.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does soil, canopy and crop work
together for a crop load balance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, software, hardware, we're trying to
take spatial data through a computer and
[SPEAKER_00]: control the mechanism on a machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes some engineering and
variable rate applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we apply those variable rates,
how is it impacting our growth product
[SPEAKER_00]: could be in the vineyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, for soil, we use what we call a dual
EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's EM38.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all soil scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't really understand it that
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses electromagnetic induction to give
you, this is a dual EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It oscillates back and forth to give us a
shallow and a deep reading, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hook this sensor on a sled,
drive it through the vineyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures electrical conductivity and
magnetic susceptibility at two depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a sensor measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an electric signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that conducts electricity in the
soil is gonna change the way that sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: is giving me data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm really interested in as a
viticulturist is that it gives me a map,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a heat map of that vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I can break that vineyard up into
zones and I can stratify my soil samples
[SPEAKER_00]: against it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guys do soil sampling, but they do it
randomly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go out to block H and I'm gonna
take two soil samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no direction in where they're
taking that soil sample at the moment by
[SPEAKER_00]: using one of these maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be more directed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the blue area makes up 40% of
the vineyard and say the orange area makes
[SPEAKER_00]: up 60%, now they can start having a
weighted average by what their soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: like in that vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly, we look at shallow electrical
conductivity because that has,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's usually the type of clay and the
amount of clay that's in that shallow
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that's having the most influence
on our Concord vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from a horticulture standpoint,
own-rooted Concord tend to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: shallow-rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the world of viticulture,
you can use a rootstock and rootstocks
[SPEAKER_00]: have different root growth habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some rootstocks that go straight
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ones that spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord, own-rooted, tends to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes a lot of sense to me that
the amount of clay content and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter and soil pH in the upper profile of
the soil is gonna have an influence on our
[SPEAKER_00]: vine growth and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a map like this starts directing me to
take samples and be able to validate
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, you get a county
soil map and when you use the soil sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting a little bit more detailed
maps to work off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our region, so I showed that map,
Lake Erie and the escarpment, everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lake plain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those actually from the lake to the
escarpment is a series of ancient beach
[SPEAKER_00]: ridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like every 30 feet of soil type
changes, and we can start picking that up
[SPEAKER_00]: with that soil sensor and as impact on our
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our canopy, we use NDVI, so Normalized
Difference Vegetative Index, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really using red and near-infrared wave
bands on a sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get NDVI from a drone,
you can get it from a airplane,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get it from a satellite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use, pretty much when we started the
project, we're like, what's cheap and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can buy these NDVI sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be one called a Green Seeker
that was part of N-Tech technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it's bought out by Trimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use Crop Circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Crop Circle sensor has three wave
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sending out white light,
it's hitting the leaves, the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: reflecting the light back, and we're
sensing with near-infrared, red,
[SPEAKER_00]: and red edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use those three wave bands to
come up with different plant indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm really looking for, from my
standpoint is, is there a leaf there or
[SPEAKER_00]: not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next video will help explain
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NDVI is just a way to measure,
are there leaves there, and what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: health of the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it up against the canopy because I
wanna know where the vines are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong, and where the vines are
growing very weak, and how that changes
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the old Green Seeker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to go really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Crop Circle sensors that we're
using now.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the three wave bands go through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Gallo Vineyard, that's a Table
Grape Vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a national project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working in vineyards both here in
New York and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Merlot Vineyard in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's a vineyard in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a good idea where the
canopy was very sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were gonna get low NDVI values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's here where it's very thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get higher NDVI values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get, again, we get maps like this,
where it's showing me where the vines are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty weak, and where the vines are
pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of Concord, Concord
horticulture, again, high wire cordon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shoots come out and then they droop
down, which might be different than a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vineyards you'll see around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Riesling would be a low wire cordon
with an upward growth habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are put up into catch wires so you
have a vertical shoot position system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work in both, but here in Concord,
if early in the season, this makes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of sense, we use one sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to use an array of sensors that
didn't really help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use one sensor here, and as that vine
grows throughout the season, we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: drop the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know if one vine is growing very,
very strong, this is the sensor will
[SPEAKER_00]: saturate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I still have weak vines in the middle
of the season, I'm getting lower
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, really we're just seeing are
there leaves there or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a little bit to do with the
health of the leaf, but we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: address that too much at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that's on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, validate, validate, validate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we take a heat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll stratify samples based on that
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a guy collecting pruning weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, either through machine or by
hand, you prune a vineyard, you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up the sticks and you weigh them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very labor-intensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to do it in the middle of
February.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I started this project,
as I said, I never wanted pruning weights
[SPEAKER_00]: ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I take more pruning weights than
ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for those relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the relationship between vine size
in terms of pruning weight and our NDVI
[SPEAKER_00]: signature in the vineyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can translate this color map that's
an NDVI map into an actual pruning weight
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use that my crop load formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do the same thing with growers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have a loaner sensor
program right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as growers are out spraying their
vineyard or mowing their vineyard or
[SPEAKER_00]: applying fertilizer, they can put one of
these sensors on their tractor,
[SPEAKER_00]: collect data for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We process the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give them the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll define where the transects are that
they can take their validation
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so every vineyard can get their
own like internal standard or what their
[SPEAKER_00]: NDVI to pruning weight relationship is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're turning a pretty picture,
this pretty picture of NDVI actual into a
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning weight map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you talk to growers, a one pound
vine, two pound vine, three pound vine
[SPEAKER_00]: means something to them more than an NDVI
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry is very hot on this topic
of crop estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know midseason, either
destructively or non-destructively,
[SPEAKER_00]: what my harvest weight is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know within 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're dealing with a five acre
vineyard, yeah, you probably do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're dealing with 30,000 acres,
it's a really difficult question to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because there's so much
variation out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil management, vine growth are all
impacting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, a viticulturist throughout
the season will measure what we call yield
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do it manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sampling, typically random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we make that better by stratifying our
samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: We think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will measure shoot counts because
all these shoots have clusters on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of shoots will relate to
what your total crop weight is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clusters per shoot or cluster counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berry count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a concord flower cluster may have 100
florets on them, and about 30 of those
[SPEAKER_00]: will set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some years it's 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years that's 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing what the berry count per
cluster is and then berry size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these yield components, shoots per
vine, clusters per shoot, berries per
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster, and berry size all impact what
our final crop estimate is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working with engineers at Carnegie
Mellon who have developed this image
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take this red machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stereo image.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the shiny red bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the vineyard and it takes
pictures of the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at different times of the season,
when it's early season shoots or
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-season cluster counts or berry counts
or berry size, it stitches those images
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they use algorithms to count
what's in those images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, it works very well at counting
what it can count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do a very good job counting
what it can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to count berries on a
cluster, if those clusters are exposed,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in a vertical shoot position system
where the leaves are pulled and the
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters are hanging out there,
it's very accurate at counting berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also have berries hiding
other berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they deal with this occlusion factor or
visibility factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to measure these yield
components, identifying what some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: occlusion factors are, and then they try
to make a crop estimate based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here's a video of the thing in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use it during the dormant season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to develop algorithms to
count buds, so dormant buds, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work in table grapes looking at
color development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use stuff like leaf blowers to try to
get the leaves out of the way so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: take pictures of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Merlot Vineyard in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is what it's taking a
picture of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it is going through its
algorithms to count the fruit that's
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's developing a spatial map of
berry count across that vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we validate that with yield
monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's their CMU imaging of berry count
in that vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the harvest yield monitor is what
we get off of the yield monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to look at the relationship
between those two and see how close they
[SPEAKER_00]: match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield monitors, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all coming together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're evaluating two yield monitors on
a harvester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really helps with we have a crop
estimation in the middle of the season and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is our final crop weight at the end
of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a yield monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was developed in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another one that was
developed by a company called Oxbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits right here, the one from
Australia, on the cross-compatible
[SPEAKER_00]: conveyor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you ever seen a grape harvester
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape harvester goes over one row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shakes the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit falls off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes over this conveyor belt into a
chase tractor, into bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those bins get put on a trailer and
then put in a processing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this yield monitor has a false way
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the fruit goes over the belt,
it's recording a weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can map that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's hooked up with GPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have another one called an Oxbow
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxbow is a company that makes,
like, machine harvesters and grape
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have an impact plate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you are probably familiar with
grain harvesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use an impact plate as the grain's
coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hitting a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they translate that into a yield
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the same thing with grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's the impact plate or the
false way frame, we're relating the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming off of the sensor to actual
either bucket weights or bin weights or
[SPEAKER_00]: actual truck weights that go into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're relating those to what the yield
monitor says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting nice relationships so we
can use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's hot off the press,
so this image was actually made earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: this week during our harvest this year,
is juice-soluble solids mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grape growers get paid for their grapes
based on yield and sugar content,
[SPEAKER_00]: juice-soluble solids, something we call
BRICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure refractive index of the juice,
and we call it BRICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they get paid on yield and BRICS,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a minimum BRICS level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drop below that minimum BRICS,
your load gets rejected, or you go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: low solids program, and you get paid a lot
less for the grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers are really interested to know
what their yield and their sugar content
[SPEAKER_00]: is as they're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they go into a field and the
BRICS are too low, they have to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: another field and pick fruit that's ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they do something Welch's doesn't want
to hear about called field blending,
[SPEAKER_00]: is they will put unripe fruit in a bin,
and then they'll go to a field that's
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe, and they'll put more sweet stuff on
top and try to get that into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to eliminate field blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can either measure juice-soluble
solids on the fly, or use our crop load
[SPEAKER_00]: models to predict, this field's gonna
ripen last, this one's gonna ripen
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, that directs the grower to be
able to go out and pick fruit when they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there are inline refractometers
that you can purchase, and they use them
[SPEAKER_00]: in factories, and you can measure the
BRICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not like the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: What my crew has been working on,
and we're gonna try to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property, is how to get juice
to the refractometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grapes are falling off of the belt,
and it's very difficult to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: BRICS of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting non-soluble solids in there
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So skins, leaves, and so guys that I've
worked with, they have developed a
[SPEAKER_00]: processing unit that mounts onto a
harvester that actually samples a portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fruit that's falling off of the
belt, and it puts it through a mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: that sends juice to the refractometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refractometer reads it, and actually the
juice goes back on the belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the first maps that are
coming off of that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our measurement, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure soil, canopy, crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these different sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dual EM, NDVI, destructive and
non-destructive yield monitoring with a
[SPEAKER_00]: CMU imaging system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a destructive system that we
use that we actually go out and clean pick
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit in the middle of the season,
try to estimate what's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we also measure yield and BRICS
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those sensors are working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about modeling of the
spatial data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when I first started doing this,
I did it probably like most people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into this business is you have
40,000 data points in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You project those through ArcGIS or some
other spatial program, and you try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some data smoothing, and you get a
picture, and it can be very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is information in that spatial
data that is difficult to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use both global variogram
modeling and local variogram modeling to
[SPEAKER_00]: make these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what a variogram tells us is
how much of the variation in the vineyard
[SPEAKER_00]: is random, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have big and small vines over here,
but most of them are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have big and small vines over here,
but most of them are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of this randomness that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a global variogram of a field will
tell me, oh, 50% of your variation is this
[SPEAKER_00]: random I use the word crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's random crap, and it's just like
making noise in my data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 50% of the variation is spatially
structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on, oh, my soil type is more
clay over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more gravel over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what I want to manage against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to be able to capture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this kind of modeling does
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as these, the smoothing technique,
I guess is the best way to say it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually looking at every data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's looking at the neighbors of data
points around each one to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I get farther and farther away,
how are those points influencing this
[SPEAKER_00]: point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smooths that data, and it does it
in a way in which we can extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern out of the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this smoothing process is done on a
common grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every, and our, we just happen to
select a grid size that is equal to our
[SPEAKER_00]: vine density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, every grid point equates to
a vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, now that I project everything
onto a common grid, I can look at the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: map, the canopy map, and the crop map,
and I can mine through that data and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point in the vineyard,
I'm standing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this kind of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's imparting this kind of vine growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should probably be able to hang this
kind of crop here to get it right in an
[SPEAKER_00]: average growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using that now to manage my
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we look at all these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're collecting all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the comments that the industry
growers will say, oh, I'm in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I pay someone to do a flyover of my
vineyard of NDVI, and I have all these
[SPEAKER_00]: maps sitting on my desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what to do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big issue with the industry is I
have data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do, again, since everything is
projected onto a common grid, I can mine
[SPEAKER_00]: through that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look for correlations between the
soil and the canopy and the canopy and the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some images where I'm like,
yeah, it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the deep magnetic susceptibility is
just some big streaky map, and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean anything to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, say, a shallow EC, a mid-season
NDVI, and my yield map all have some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of correlation that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about, at some point in the
process of all this, we need to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers' input.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower has, based on their economics,
based on what they're growing and for what
[SPEAKER_00]: market, they have their own idea what they
want to do with the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, they need to come into
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where they would come in to
say, yep, I know there's a low spot in my
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard, and I know that's affecting my
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, leave that layer in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find the layers that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it K-means cluster analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's taking the data from, say,
these four layers, and it's creating
[SPEAKER_00]: zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is trying to mean separate those
zones as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reduce the variation within those
zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have discrete zones within the
vineyard that, hopefully, make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also click on the red,
and it'll tell you, oh, you have this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil, this kind of canopy, and this
kind of crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to manage it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the red or the green and
the blue zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we measure with all our sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We model that data doing the spatial data
processing, coming up with our management
[SPEAKER_00]: classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have to manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you the best way to try to
describe this, just through an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Concord vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a small, a medium, and high vine
growth area, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do our crop estimate in middle of
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the red zone has about
eight tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know those vines are really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, you cannot write the eight
tons per acre on that part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the blue zone, our big, healthy
vineyard, they have more water,
[SPEAKER_00]: more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can ripen a larger crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're hanging almost 12 tons per
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the growing season, you probably can
ripen that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to take off more fruit here,
actually, to try to get the small vines in
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big ones, eh, I'll take off a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to leave more crop,
because it's able to ripen that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that with a harvester machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this harvester, middle of the season,
it is going to, just like at harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it shakes the vines, but it's going
to shake them more gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say I want to take off two tons per acre
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I want to take off one ton per acre
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll slow down the beater speed and take
off less fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our spatial data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes into our map.
[SPEAKER_00]: The map talks to this computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use an ag leader system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimble and Raven, you know, Chevy,
Ford, people have their favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use ag leader just because that's the
system we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes into their software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually trick this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really meant for liquid fertilizer
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about flow rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have to tell, in the dark
blue zone, I want this flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the light blue zone, I want a
different flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of going to the liquid
dispense of fertilizer, we send that
[SPEAKER_00]: signal to what we call a PWM valve,
a pulse width modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ag engineers are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a hydraulic valve that
chirps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The faster it chirps, the more hydraulic
fluid it goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the faster the machine works and vice
versa as it goes slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the map talks to the PWM valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the harvester just goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at crop estimation time, we want to
take off all the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we drive very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we shake the vines really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we harvest that fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect it and weigh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using that to do our crop estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got to the, I have eight tons
per acre here and I have 12 tons per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I want to just shake off a
little bit in the different zones,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is in the throat of a harvester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're driving much faster,
somewhere between five and six miles per
[SPEAKER_00]: hour through a vineyard, but shaking the
vines very gently just to get a portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put that into our crop load
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, so going way back to the end of
the talk, fruit weight to pruning weight
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, we're using our spatial data
validated against those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements to come up with a harvest
yield map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our crop weight, our pruning weight map
based on NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually do the math between those two
to come up with our crop load or RIVAZ
[SPEAKER_00]: index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these strips here are our controls
where we didn't do any thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a red color would be over cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing variable rate thinning within
that vineyard, we made it more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pre-thinning, we had vines in the red,
green, and blue zones that were all over
[SPEAKER_00]: cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my RIVAZ index.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance vines are about 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got stuff that's way up in the 30,
35.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are way over cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to bring the reds down more
than the blues, and that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after variable rate thinning,
we've shifted these population curves
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm really trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultimate goal is I want to shift the
population of those vines where I want
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and I want to make them more narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make them more uniform because
that's going to have a lot of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit for our grower that A,
they're balanced, and B, they're not as
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my fruit's going to be more uniform
coming into the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of benefits that we've seen
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know it was that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting benefits out of just a
single data layer, whether that's soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy or crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving growers an idea of,
wow, I had no idea that I had that much
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in my vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know I was losing so much money
in this one section because my crop is too
[SPEAKER_00]: low or my vines are too weak and I need to
do something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improved crop estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the question of crop estimation
on an individual farm versus crop
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation for an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're two totally different
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're addressing the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get crop estimation?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get crop estimation in my
particular farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to be within 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using spatial data to stratify our
mid-season crop estimation samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's putting us somewhere in the 5%
to 10% accuracy range, looking in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use random sampling, we are off
anywhere from 10% to 23%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably somewhere around 25% to 30%
is what the industry would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're off every year, about 30% of
what they thought they were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think the stratified sampling is
going to give benefits to our crop
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation to get with the 5% range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preventing just one rejected load pays for
the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we're doing on-the-fly
yield and bricks monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if I'm a grower and I have a
semi-load of Concord grapes that's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: $6,000 and it goes to the plant and it
gets rejected or it goes into a low-solid
[SPEAKER_00]: program, I've just lost a lot of money out
of my operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm picking and I can see what's
going on, be able to visualize the fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: ripeness in the field, then I can prevent
that from happening in the technology of
[SPEAKER_00]: paper itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the quote I love the best,
making a decision in May that saved my ass
[SPEAKER_00]: in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was actually just said to me last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the growers we're working with,
we were doing the variable rate shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning work in his vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, left way more buds than he
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out, did early season NDVI,
related that shoot count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had an idea, oh, I want to leave
about 120 shoots in this vineyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe less on these vines, more on these
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a variable rate shoot thinning
trial in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got past that threat of spring
frost, could assess what his crop's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be, do variable rate crop adjustment at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one field where we did the
experiment in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another field where he didn't do
the experiment in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he could, that fruit was just not
getting ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of rain this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sugar went up and it's kind of just
kind of hung out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to pick that field,
couldn't get it ripe, went over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: field where we did the variable rate shoot
thinning and was able to pick that load
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said that, you know, at least on
that particular day, the technology saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, and I think that's it and I'm under
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Julie Tarara is, she was a researcher
out of Washington state and then with
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA, did develop a strain gauge on the,
for the wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some published work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Justine, you have anything
to add to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just never commercialized to my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's a good solid good word.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, like with a lot of our sensors,
you have the strain gauge on there and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use a software to kind of
eliminate that noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then throughout a season, you can feel
how that, you know, how there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: tension on that wire and less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to separate out how much of
that weight is canopy and how much of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's all part of our kind of our
crop load decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing destructive crop
estimation work for 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we do it is, is a grower will
actually take a rope that's 1% of an acre,
[SPEAKER_00]: 48.6 feet, lay that out in the vineyard
and clean pick that 1% and weigh the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the berry curve, 30,
roughly 30 days after bloom is 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: final weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 30 days after bloom, they,
they pick four tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're going to have eight tons
per acre at harvest based on weather
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially the timing of bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have rules of thumb that we go
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like for every three days is equal to
a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm three days early on bloom,
that's an extra ton I can write them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a week late on bloom, that's two
tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably can't write them that I would
normally write them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as long-term data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have phenology dates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same set of vines that we've collected,
bud break, bloom, verasion, harvest dates
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see a ton of trend, you know,
over the last 50 years, a trend towards
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier bud break, earlier bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should translate into more fruit
that we can write them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Falls also seem to be getting wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a lot of rain just in the
last couple of weeks and that'll hurt us
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of trying to write them that
fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we started to use lidar very early
in the project and it was more towards
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy structure, not much with with berry
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other sensors out there that I
think could help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carnegie Mellon is really focused on their
image sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get a berry diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer is yes, but we're not using
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I don't know what is y,
what is x, but the curve is like initially
[SPEAKER_02]: the year and then slowly get staggered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: How that curve is scalable across the
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently to me that curve is like from
some kind of calibration between
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if you go back to 1960,
there'll be a curve on pruning weight and
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and it does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the vine gets bigger within its
defined space, as a vine gets bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: it produces more leaf area and then then
it if 100% fills that canopy space and by
[SPEAKER_00]: making the vine even bigger or more
vegetative, all you're doing is packing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with more leaves, but those leaves aren't
productive because they're tucked up into
[SPEAKER_00]: the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the same curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that with our NDVI because it is
the sensor is pointing at the canopy on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside and you're getting,
you know, when the canopy is not filled,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that canopy is filled,
it saturates that sensor so that curve
[SPEAKER_00]: flattens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's translatable to other
vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still say the number one problem in our
industry is lack of vine size,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost, I would say almost all of our
vineyards are dealing with the one to
[SPEAKER_00]: three pound vine, not the three to five
pound vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a winery that's on a very
vigorous root stock, Justine knows very
[SPEAKER_00]: well about that stuff because a lot of her
work is on decrease in vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of wineries that are
dealing in the three to five pound vines
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're actually trying to bring the
vines down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way to answer your question
is if you're below 100% canopy fill,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think NDVI is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're above 100% canopy fill,
I don't think NDVI is very good and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need another technology, whatever that is,
to measure canopy density.
Good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary, I have a question about thinning,
just general.
And that is, so while plants generally do
have responses that allow them to adjust,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say, flower numbers by a boring or
rest of the development or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: or even after it begins to grow,
if the conditions of the environment or
[SPEAKER_04]: the entomology of carbohydrates supply or
something did not add it, the plants do
[SPEAKER_04]: have mechanisms to afford the rest of the
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet it seems that in your grapes,
they tend to be very liberal in allowing a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot more food than what you would like as
a grower to maintain and you're making the
[SPEAKER_04]: adjustment of the thinning process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that contrasts a lot with my
experience in maize where generally what
[SPEAKER_04]: we've found is that the germplasm and the
phenotypes that are out there tend to be
[SPEAKER_04]: too conservative relative to what growers
would like for food breeding and trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: get the plants to not afford to become
barren plants under stressed conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you make a comment on what is it
that's different about grapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something about the female
character?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do measure the yield components and as
we increase bud number, we will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, but there's a diminishing return on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you increase bud number, the yield goes
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the average clusters per shoot will go
down, average berries per cluster will go
[SPEAKER_00]: down, average berry weight will go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually put all that stuff into our
crop load model account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really the bottom line for us is that
we can over crop a vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reduction in yield components isn't as
great as you can make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can leave 150 buds on a Concord vine
on an eight foot spacing and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially produce 12 to 15 tons breaker,
which we will never get right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I left it there, vine size will end up
going down because of carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about mid season to final harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done studies looking at starch
accumulation in perennial structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a vine that is over cropped,
the starch is going into the wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar is going into the fruit late in the
season and there's a balance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much crop, you're going to get less
starch into the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less root growth, less vine size,
less pruning weight, less productivity for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tend to see is you over crop a
vine because you forced it by leaving too
[SPEAKER_00]: many buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive vine size down and your
production goes down over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when I started working at
Cornell, there was a big issue called
[SPEAKER_00]: Miller and Dodge and we all, I think we
finally came up that it was a carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers started going to minimal
pruning, which was they just skirted the
[SPEAKER_00]: vine so you suddenly left, you may have a
vine that you pruned at 60 buds for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of kept the crop load down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were strong vines and then all of
a sudden you left 400 buds by just hardly
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a system that came out of
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden you had 13 tons per
acre, 13 tons per acre and then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year it came back with two tons per acre
and then it bounced back up to 15 tons per
[SPEAKER_00]: acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the years that it had two tons per
acre, all the clusters were there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the fruit never developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way we attack it now is we
try to balance it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave a little bit more crop that we need
and adjust down as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, quick question regarding the
thinning of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the, are the, the grapes, the berries
that are left, are they damaged by,
[SPEAKER_03]: and is that a problem or just out of
curiosity?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we've been doing this for as long
as I've been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a system that was started
with Bob Pool before, before I came on
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you will talk to growers and
there have been horror stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the harvesters we used to use,
they have rods in them and they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: have straight rods and they used to hit
the vines like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of whip action at the
end and there was a lot of broken shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of damaged berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people said thinning, mechanical
thinning is never going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day I have old growers like
you're killing my vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the harvesters, we can tighten up
where the bow rods are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not straight rods anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bow rods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no whip action and now they're in
sync.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually grip the vine and we just
shake it a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's a variety issue thing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord at the end of the season will have
three grand berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle of the season when they're
thinning, they're about one and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: grand berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most vinifera, especially like Riesling,
that's a tight cluster variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the season will be 1.5
grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the berries are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Concord, loose clusters,
big berries, middle of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually works fairly well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have trouble with tight clustered
vinifera varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other machines out there that
are trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we get a lot at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
