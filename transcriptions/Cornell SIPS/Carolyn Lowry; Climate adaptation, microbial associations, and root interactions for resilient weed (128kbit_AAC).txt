[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you all so much for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for that introduction and
the invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really exciting to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started at Penn State in January
2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like I'm no longer allowed to
say that I'm new.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm leaving that world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really excited to share some of
the work that my lab has been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all the work that you will see
today has been done by my amazing lab
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's their picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really fortunate since starting
out at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some phenomenal graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited to be able to share some
of their work with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are just some of the themes of
research that my lab is really interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be able to touch on all of these
a little bit today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really interested in thinking
about how climate change will affect weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and the way that we manage them.
[SPEAKER_03]: How we can leverage plant diversity to
increase ecosystem services and
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed-microbe interactions, which is a new
area of research for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I started, Penn State had started
their huge microbiome center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's been really great to leverage
that expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then thinking about root traits and
how plants compete with each other below
[SPEAKER_03]: ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my talk today, I'm going to talk about
three different components of my research
[SPEAKER_03]: program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first one is going to be
looking at whether or not we can leverage
[SPEAKER_03]: crop species or diversity to influence
weed seed mortality in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: How will climate change affect weed seed
bank dynamics?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then thinking about do inter-specific
interactions influence the ways that
[SPEAKER_03]: plants allocate carbon above versus below
ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me talk about the first one right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been a lot of interest in
thinking about how we can manage the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: seed bank, either by reducing weed seed
rain and seed inputs into the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then also accelerating seed mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the reason that people are
really interested in making and managing
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil seed bank is because most annual
weeds in a cropping field come from the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil seed bank, the primary source of
recruitment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we can figure out ways to either
reduce seed inputs into the soil or
[SPEAKER_03]: accelerate seed mortality once seeds enter
the soil, we might be able to really
[SPEAKER_03]: decrease the sort of density of weeds that
are emerging with our crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once a seed enters their soil,
there's really three mechanisms by which a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed can die.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is just natural physiological
aging.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second is seed predation or herbivory
by things like mice or ants or other
[SPEAKER_03]: insects, birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they also can be infected by soil
microbes and then decay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we think about these sort of
two major modes of biocontrol of seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil seed bank, seed predation or
microbial infection and decay,
[SPEAKER_03]: we actually know so much more about the
organisms that the herbivores that consume
[SPEAKER_03]: weed seeds compared to the microbes in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, this is a result from a
web of science search that I did in March
[SPEAKER_03]: 2024, so exactly one year ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just looking at the number of articles
that I found that either talked about seed
[SPEAKER_03]: predators and the sort of management
practices that we can use to try to build
[SPEAKER_03]: up those populations and increase the
number of seeds that we're losing to
[SPEAKER_03]: predation compared to microbes in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, we really know much
less about microbes in the soil that can
[SPEAKER_03]: infect and kill weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to seed predators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say that also the vast
majority of these publications came out
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to next generation sequencing
becoming like an affordable tool for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really there's a lot of questions that
we could ask sort of just thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: how we can leverage microbes to accelerate
seed mortality in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we think about doing that,
there's really two strategies that we
[SPEAKER_03]: might be able to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is we can use something like an
inoculant to supplement those populations
[SPEAKER_03]: of microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So adding microbes to the soil through
inoculations or utilizing management
[SPEAKER_03]: practices that may increase the abundance
and activity of microbes that may infect
[SPEAKER_03]: weed seeds in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my research really sort of falls
underneath the second category.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the question that we really wanted
to ask was whether or not we can leverage
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant community to affect rates of
seed mortality in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we wanted to look at
this is because the plants themselves are
[SPEAKER_03]: one of if not the most important levers
that farmers have to sort of manage the
[SPEAKER_03]: microbial populations in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we know there's been research
showing that the plant community can
[SPEAKER_03]: affect soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that soil microbes can affect weed
seeds and accelerate mortality or cause
[SPEAKER_03]: seed mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we were trying to do is to
really link these processes together and
[SPEAKER_03]: ask the question whether or not we can use
the plant community to influence the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiome and increase seed mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we decided to do this research in a
perennial forage system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because perennial
forages are a really important tool to
[SPEAKER_03]: include a component of crop rotations to
break up weed life cycles of annual weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so during this time, you have this
sort of consistent ground cover that
[SPEAKER_03]: really suppresses any new weeds from
emerging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the frequent cutting that they do
each time that they harvest perennial
[SPEAKER_03]: forage that frequent cutting can sort of
terminate any annual weeds that did
[SPEAKER_03]: emerge, thereby reducing new weed seed
inputs into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided to do this in a perennial
forage system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually created a perennial forage
diversity gradient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had alfalfa, which is a perennial
legume, orchard grass, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: perennial grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say that an alfalfa orchard
grass mixture is one of if not the most
[SPEAKER_03]: common perennial forages that farmers at
least in Pennsylvania are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with that, we also included this
forage chicory, which is a non-leguminous
[SPEAKER_03]: forb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we selected chicory was
because it's really the only perennial
[SPEAKER_03]: forage that is not a legume or a grass
that is really available to farmers at
[SPEAKER_03]: this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we set up a diversity gradient
where we had each of them in monoculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: all combinations of the two species
mixtures, and then the three species
[SPEAKER_03]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had that replicated four times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we did in each of these plots
where we had our perennial forage
[SPEAKER_03]: community is we buried weed seeds in these
small bags in various locations throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: each plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these were buried shortly after
planting in 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had multiple extraction time
points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one year after burial, one and a half
years, two years, and then two and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: years after burial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we did is once we extracted
these seeds, so we extracted two bags each
[SPEAKER_03]: time point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we pulled those bags together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We washed the seeds in the soil through a
series of sieves so that we could collect
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we immediately split that
population or that sample of seeds into
[SPEAKER_03]: two batches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half went for alumina sequencing so that
we could characterize the microbial
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And half we did viability testing with
tetrazoleum assays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in order for our amplicon
sequencing, what we did is what we first
[SPEAKER_03]: did is we sterilized the surface of the
seeds because we really wanted to know
[SPEAKER_03]: what microbes were getting inside the
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we extracted the DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we used 16S RNA to characterize
universal primers to characterize the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial community, and then ITS to
characterize the fungal community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only going to be presenting on the
results on the bacterial community today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our primary hypothesis was that a
more diverse plant community would support
[SPEAKER_03]: a more diverse microbial community and
that in doing so, we might get sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: accelerated mortality in the soil
underneath these more diverse mixtures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about viability on the
y-axis here, we'd have greater loss of
[SPEAKER_03]: viability in these more diverse
communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will say that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here what we're looking at is Powell
amaranth, which is a pigweed species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of a common pigweed species in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the data that I'm going to show
you today, is going to be on Powell
[SPEAKER_03]: amaranth seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is looking at our mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's on the y-axis here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the greater the bar, the more dead the
seeds were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have our seven different
treatments here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really found no consistent effect of
treatment on seed mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a trend in the second year for the
monocultures actually having greater
[SPEAKER_03]: mortality, so sort of inconsistent with
our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really did not find a huge effect
of treatment on our seed mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what we also expected is that
when we looked at the bacterial
[SPEAKER_03]: communities within the seeds, that we
might see the monocultures sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: separating out, so having different
bacterial communities in the seeds that
[SPEAKER_03]: were buried in those monoculture
treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe the mixture would be sort
of some intermediary between them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, we actually really didn't
find much of an effect of treatment on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial community that was inside the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is results from a principal
coordinate analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the closer the points are in this
ordination, the more similar those
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial communities are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we really found no effect of our
perennial forage treatment on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial communities that were getting
inside these Powell amaranth seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you guys are thinking,
did these people find anything
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, we actually did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the data that I'm about to present
to you is really like everything that you
[SPEAKER_03]: would expect to happen to a seed once it
enters the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really have had so little work done
on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is sort of like exciting to sort of
have this confirmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that we did find is that the
bacterial communities within our seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: actually differed over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is a principal coordinate
analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more similar the points, the more
similar the bacterial communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was our original population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the bacterial community,
the endophytic community that was inside
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds prior to the seeds ever entering
the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can see, so here is one year
burial, one and a half year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after two and a half years,
the communities kind of became more
[SPEAKER_03]: stagnant and stopped changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did see the sort of variation in
these bacterial communities over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another thing that we saw is that
the diversity of bacteria within these
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds actually tended to increase over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are three different metrics of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chawan is basically sort of similar to
richness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Shannon and Simpson
diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the zero is the seeds that were
never buried in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can kind of see, we see this trend
of increasing diversity of the bacterial
[SPEAKER_03]: communities in the seeds over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another thing that we saw was
that we actually saw that in the samples
[SPEAKER_03]: that had low mortality and high mortality,
that the bacterial communities actually
[SPEAKER_03]: differed between them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did is we sort of, you know,
we classified for each sample,
[SPEAKER_03]: we classified the sort of percent
mortality of the seeds of each sample,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we classified them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So low was less than 33% mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medium mortality was 33 to 66% and high
mortality was above 66%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you could see, the yellow and the
dark blue, so is low, yeah, low and high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we saw this sort of like difference
in the community of seeds that had greater
[SPEAKER_03]: mortality compared to those that had low
mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we looked at sort of the
different bacterial genera that might be
[SPEAKER_03]: causing this, there were a few that we saw
sort of like an increase in their relative
[SPEAKER_03]: abundance as the seeds tended to go
towards higher mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this really sort of sets up some
future, you know, hypothesis testing of
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not we can actually sort of
pass whether or not these specific
[SPEAKER_03]: microbes in the soil can actually help
accelerate weed seed mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so then here what we're looking
at is just our first axis of our principal
[SPEAKER_03]: coordinate analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the Y axis, we have the percent
mortality in our Powell amaranth seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did see, you know, some association
with our bacterial community sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: predicting the mortality of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the one thing I really want to
point out is what we can't say is like
[SPEAKER_03]: which came first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was the seed dead?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these microbes moved in,
these bacteria moved in, or did the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria move in and then the seeds died?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, future work really need
to sort of be set up to sort of test
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not we can actually say whether
or not these specific bacteria are sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: helping to induce mortality of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, in sort of thinking about
how we might be able to leverage seed
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiomes to accelerate seed mortality
in the soil, I think we have a long way to
[SPEAKER_03]: go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in order to get there,
we really need to establish some causal
[SPEAKER_03]: links between specific microbial
populations and their communities and seed
[SPEAKER_03]: mortality, as well as, you know,
hopefully determine management practices
[SPEAKER_03]: that can help increase both the abundance
and activity of these microbial
[SPEAKER_03]: populations within the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our results suggest that, you know,
using, altering the forage plant community
[SPEAKER_03]: may not be an effective strategy to get
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now I'm moving to my second
portion of my talk, thinking about how
[SPEAKER_03]: climate change will affect weed seed,
seed bank dynamics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually talk about two
different components of our research.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, looking at how increasing
temperatures affect weed seed persistence
[SPEAKER_03]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second, looking at how warmer
temperatures can affect weed emergence
[SPEAKER_03]: timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: In both of these studies, my lab uses
these open top chambers to passively
[SPEAKER_03]: increase temperatures out in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're commonly used in sort of like
climate change research in the Arctic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, we've been able to adapt them more
for like an agricultural setting to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of passively increase temperatures
when we're out in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we know that temperatures are
increasing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of reasons to think
why warmer temperatures might cause weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: to become less persistent in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for example, we know that seeds,
you know, stored at room temperature are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have a shorter shelf life than
seeds that you put in the fridge or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in 40 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of reasons to think that
warmer temperatures will actually decrease
[SPEAKER_03]: seed persistence, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil temperatures often result in
increased microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have greater sort of seed
infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can increase seed respiration rates,
thereby causing seeds to draw down on
[SPEAKER_03]: their reserves in a shorter period of
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then potentially changes to soil
freeze-thaw cycles that could come from
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased snow cover might fracture seed
coats and leave seeds more vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's this common saying that
maybe you've heard like one year's seeding
[SPEAKER_03]: equals seven years weeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really what we're trying to ask here is
maybe with maybe climate change,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there might be some good things
that come from climate change and maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: one year's seeding will actually be equal
five years weeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to do this, this is work done by my
graduate, former master student,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ashley Isaacson, who's now an extension
educator in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she compared two treatments of
control, so that's no open top chamber,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then with the open top chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was evaluating the persistence of
three different weed species, so red root
[SPEAKER_03]: pigweed, common ragweed, and large
crabgrass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so essentially what Ashley did is she
extracted soil cores from these small one
[SPEAKER_03]: meter squared plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within each of these soil cores,
she spiked like 500 seeds of her species
[SPEAKER_03]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we chose to do this
method, which is called the seeded core
[SPEAKER_03]: method, is because I was really sort of
initially interested in sort of like how
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased snow cover might change soil
physical properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wanted to have the seeds to be in
as much of a realistic environment as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible, which is why we did not use
those little bags that I showed you
[SPEAKER_03]: previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually decided to just like
directly spike the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we marked them with these little
sort of landscape fabric staples with tags
[SPEAKER_03]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we, oh, and then we extracted at
three different points.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're about six months apart
over an 18 month period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now what we're looking at is how
much warming we got from our OTC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Y axis here is the difference in
temperature in Celsius in the OTC compared
[SPEAKER_03]: to the control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on average, we are only getting about a
half a degree Celsius increase in
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with this study, we only got a 0.4
degree Celsius increase in temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to point out to you that some
months we actually had cooler temperatures
[SPEAKER_03]: in our OTCs compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because we once
again did this in a perennial forage
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of trying to like simulate
what would happen to seeds during the
[SPEAKER_03]: perennial phase of their crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had an alfalfa orchard grass
mixture in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what ended up happening is we
actually had in these months much greater
[SPEAKER_03]: productivity of the alfalfa orchard grass
mixture in the OTCs compared to the
[SPEAKER_03]: control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think we actually got cooler
temperatures from like evapotransfer of
[SPEAKER_03]: cooling, maybe a greater shading.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a sort of a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because we had like greater
productivity in those OTCs, we actually
[SPEAKER_03]: saw a decrease in temperature underneath
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so this would be like very
indicative of very near warming or very,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, very near future essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so looking at our results,
so here the Y axis is actually seed
[SPEAKER_03]: viability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lower it is, the more seeds were
dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we actually, for two of our
species, common agweed and large
[SPEAKER_03]: crabgrass, we saw no statistically
significant effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did see a small but significant
acceleration of mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of viability in our warming for
red root pigweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, it was just like a very minor
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this was kind of like
unexpected for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really like expected that we would see
sort of greater loss of mortality,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, more accelerated mortality with
our warming treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the reasons maybe why we
didn't see that is that seeded core method
[SPEAKER_03]: that we use is actually pretty variable
because there was already some natural
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of populations of those seeds in the
soil that we spiked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that just created variability in
the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, maybe we just need a
greater increase in temperature to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually see more of an effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe in the future, using something
like soil heating cables, you might be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to see more of an effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are really challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to like find an electrical source
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's all types of challenges when
you actually like are trying to pump
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity out into your field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is like, you know, way above my
assistant professor pay grade at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hoping, you know, in the future,
maybe doing things like that would be more
[SPEAKER_03]: feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second question that we asked is how
will increased temperatures affect weed
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence timing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is research done by a PhD
candidate in my group, Missy Quirala.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were really interested in sort
of thinking about how climate change might
[SPEAKER_03]: affect emergence timing, because
understanding when weeds emerge can be
[SPEAKER_03]: really important for trying to adequately
time management activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really want to, you know,
if you're doing any type of like post
[SPEAKER_03]: emergent weed control, you want to wait
until you have, you know, a decent flush
[SPEAKER_03]: of weeds so that you're timing it to have
the most efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you also need to hit the weeds before
they get to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding that when they emerge can
really sort of help balance those
[SPEAKER_03]: tradeoffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, so he used with his
treatments were with an OTC and without,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this time we were not in any perennial
forage system, we were just in bare soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at his results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is from 2023.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is days to 10% emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see, our results were pretty
variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had two species, giant foxtail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so the red is warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the blue is control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I should have said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the axis here is days to 10%
emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had two species where we had no
sort of significant difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have two species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lambsquarters and large crab gas where
we had more days till we hit 10%
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had two species where we had a
lower amount of days till we hit that 10%
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really sort of, you know, some species
were responding to this warming
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature, but they were spawning in
different ways and not all species were
[SPEAKER_03]: responding the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in 2024, so this past year,
we actually found that the two species
[SPEAKER_03]: that we had no significant effect of in
the first year, we actually felt so like
[SPEAKER_03]: the results could not have been more
variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here in this year, we actually had
giant foxtail and red blue pigweed that we
[SPEAKER_03]: found statistical differences between the
warming and control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant foxtail had greater time till
hitting this time we're looking at 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then red pigweed actually had a lower
number of days until it hit 50% emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, you know, really, really,
really sort of variable results that we
[SPEAKER_03]: found.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is often the case when people are
trying to understand how shifts in
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature or precipitation might affect
plant communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can be really hard to make any like
actual recommendations to farmers when
[SPEAKER_03]: your results are just like so variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be starting a much larger
project where multiple sites including
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell, 20s group at Cornell will be
looking at how, I mean, this increasing
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures with OTCs can affect weed
emergence timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully by increasing the
environmental variation, maybe we'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to find some sort of like,
you know, universal principle,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe we'll just have lots of more
variable results and try to make some
[SPEAKER_03]: sense of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the last portion of my talk is
looking at whether or not interspecific
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions can influence how plants
allocate carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I started at Penn State,
I was really interested in sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: studying below ground competition,
sort of thinking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how plants are competing for resources
below ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, our ability to study below ground
competition is really limited by our lack
[SPEAKER_03]: of ability to identify roots to species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're trying to assess how
competition or other plant plant
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions affect a specific species,
often what you do you use as your metric
[SPEAKER_03]: is biomass, right, like plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: But normally what people do is they just
harvest the above ground portion of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the plant community.
[SPEAKER_03]: They separate plants to species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, often they just sort of
ignore what's happening below ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's because, you know,
roots are just hard to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's pretty, you know,
pretty difficult to be able to identify
[SPEAKER_03]: roots to species.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, being able to have a method that
we can sort of reliably estimate root
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass of individual species when they're
in these diverse communities could really
[SPEAKER_03]: help answer sort of fundamental questions
about how competition can affect
[SPEAKER_03]: productivity, you know, competition for
below ground resources, as well as what
[SPEAKER_03]: specific root traits can influence a
plant's competitive ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then additionally, you know,
many of our like ecosystem services that
[SPEAKER_03]: we want from our crops, many of those
ecosystem services are tied to roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, nitrogen retention,
carbon storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, some studies have shown that
that carbon derived from root tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: actually last is more persistent in the
soil compared to leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also obviously nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were sort of really interested in
thinking about whether or not we could
[SPEAKER_03]: develop a method to sort of identify or
estimate the biomass of individual species
[SPEAKER_03]: in biomass diverse communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was work done by a PhD
candidate with my group Emma Rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so her research questions was whether
or not we can use next generation
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing to predict the abundance of
different species in biomass and do cover
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, and asking do cover crop species
alter their allocation to above versus
[SPEAKER_03]: below ground, roots versus shoots when in
mixtures compared to monocultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, now that there's sort of
like all these carbon markets being
[SPEAKER_03]: developed, you know, trying to estimate
how the abundance of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: different species and how might that
influence sort of persistence of carbon in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil, you know, could be a really
valuable use of this tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so Emma asked this question in this
long term cover crop diversity experiment
[SPEAKER_03]: at Penn State's called our cover crop
cocktails experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had four different cover crop
species that she was looking at,
[SPEAKER_03]: crimson clover, winter pea, triticale and
canola in monocultures, and then a four
[SPEAKER_03]: species mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what Emma did was she would extract
root cores from the soil, we would go down
[SPEAKER_03]: to 40 centimeters, we tried to go down to
50 and we just hit rocks nonstop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 40 was the best we could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know if we were in deeper, you know,
if we were out in the Midwest,
[SPEAKER_03]: we could go to a meter deep, but so she
would extract these soil cores,
[SPEAKER_03]: she would clean the roots from the soil,
she would freeze dry them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then she would use the root biomass
from the monocultures to create all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these what we call her mock mixtures where
she was sort of using fine scale,
[SPEAKER_03]: burying the proportion of each of her
species in these sort of micro centrifuge
[SPEAKER_03]: tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we use that to sort of calibrate
the method.
[SPEAKER_03]: She would extract the DNA, and then we use
universal primers for the RBCL,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a chloroplast gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the genes that is often used
in meta bar coding for plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: they often use the chloroplast genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried multiple chloroplast genes,
and RBCL was the only one that we could
[SPEAKER_03]: get to work reliably.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she would submit that for alumina
sequencing, and she would calculate the
[SPEAKER_03]: proportion of reads that was of each of
her species of interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order for this method to work,
what we really needed to see was we would
[SPEAKER_03]: get sort of like a predictable response of
a species proportion in the reads that we
[SPEAKER_03]: would get from our sequencing data,
and then the actual species proportion in
[SPEAKER_03]: the sample mass of all of these little
mock mixtures that we created.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how well does her method work?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're looking at now is the
relationship between, so this is on the
[SPEAKER_03]: x-axis, it's the proportion of each of
these species that was in mass,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was in all of her little mock
mixtures that she created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the y-axis here is what we would
have predicted based on our models.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really what we're looking at is the
observed versus the predicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how well are the models that we
generated based on this data doing and
[SPEAKER_03]: predicting?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, it's not perfect, but it has a
pretty good upper limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the upward trend, I would have
liked an R-squared that was a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: higher, but roots are messy, field work is
messy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an R-squared between 0.7 and 0.8,
it could have been better, but it could
[SPEAKER_03]: have been a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it, for the most part,
works well, and we're sort of interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in thinking about are there ways that we
can use to get better predictions from
[SPEAKER_03]: this method in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then using this method to predict
how much growth these species allocated to
[SPEAKER_03]: their roots in their monocultures versus
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have our four different species at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the blue bars are the root mass
fraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the proportion of plant biomass that it
was allocated to the roots is the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, as you can see, there were some
species that we had sort of consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, clover, we really only had
one year was statistically significant,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we saw sort of like a greater trend
for all three years having greater root
[SPEAKER_03]: allocation in the mixture compared to
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Triticale, similar, only one year was
statistically significant, but there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: trend for greater root mass fraction in
the monoculture compared to the mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for P and canola, we really saw sort
of like differing patterns over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, especially canola,
one year greater in the monoculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: another year greater in the mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this really suggests that plant plants
are varying their allocation patterns
[SPEAKER_03]: based on sort of like the community
dynamics and what other plants are around
[SPEAKER_03]: them and how that might be affecting their
own growth or potentially abiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so trying to develop methods where we
can really try to estimate how much root
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass for individual species could be
super useful in the future because we
[SPEAKER_03]: can't necessarily always predict a plant's
below ground biomass solely based on its
[SPEAKER_03]: above ground biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the areas where I am
excited to move this method to in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future is whether or not we can sort of
predict our ability to estimate root
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also what I'd really like to do
is to be able to adapt this method to work
[SPEAKER_03]: in more diverse communities, you know,
potentially crops that are competing with
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why we use cover crops is
because they're all like basically crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they had their whole genomes
available to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a lot easier when we were sort
of like trying to develop our universal
[SPEAKER_03]: primaries and things like that to have the
genome of a plant available.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot more genomes of weed
species coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it would be great to be able
to adapt this method to have more diverse
[SPEAKER_03]: species in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to sort of end this sort of
like here's some areas that my lab is
[SPEAKER_03]: working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited of some of the work
that we're coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in any of this,
I keep my Google Scholar most up to date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could just sort of Google Scholar
search me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get better about updating my
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lab website, but you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I want to end by acknowledging
all my collaborators.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, really a lot of this work could
not have been done without sort of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the collaborators have helped me
sort of build up this expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lab did all of this work without owning
a single pipette.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I really like it was very much the,
you know, the collaborators that have
[SPEAKER_03]: really sort of supported this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my funding sources at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with that, I will take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate your talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question that kind of spans all
of your experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you manage weeds kind of
contaminating each of these situations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I would say like the first
situation, the perennial forage,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like it definitely became more
weedy over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would say initially we had our
stands of, you know, the forage chicory
[SPEAKER_03]: did not do that well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that got pretty weedy, but everything
else sort of did okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, weeds came in over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best that we can do is we measured
weed biomass and we might be able to use
[SPEAKER_03]: that as a covariate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same point in time,
like you said, there were no treatment
[SPEAKER_03]: differences, no real effect of the plant
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't know how much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe you had some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's definitely something we could
look into in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so then the sort of climate change,
we just sort of like hand pulled
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that all of our plots are
pretty small.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just hand pulled everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the root study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Emma two to three times a year
would go out to her sampling points and
[SPEAKER_03]: hand weed everything because she really
was trying to limit the amount of other
[SPEAKER_03]: species that could get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even with that, you know, there was a
legacy of root biomass, root tissue in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil that, you know, probably gave us some
contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she did look at sort of like,
you know, she was able to characterize for
[SPEAKER_03]: the most common weed species and sort of
identify which, you know, of her weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: went to all of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then so basically what she was able to
do is like, you know, plot out whether or
[SPEAKER_03]: not the proportion of her weeds that were
weeds affected the sort of like difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between the predicted and observed from
her model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it probably created variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it definitely wasn't like
variability that we could predict.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was really like the best we could
do at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would be so that long term
experiment is also like insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe if we just tried to do that,
a similar study in a field that like
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't organic, and, you know,
didn't have that weed density,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe we'd have some better results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're actually doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we've sort of like moved to a field
that is less windy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, great talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of very hard things to do in the
field.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, appreciate that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, you don't even those open
top chambers, man, like, we've had those
[SPEAKER_03]: like blow across the highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, yeah, anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for it for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, it's been stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was curious about your microbe work,
cover cropping, I think like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the thought is like, okay, we have these
cover crops, and like, they might have
[SPEAKER_07]: lots of different benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really are interested in knowing
like, what all these different benefits
[SPEAKER_07]: are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're like, I'm gonna bury my
seeds in these plots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you didn't really find any
consistent trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was at a farm once and the farmer
was like, growing buckwheat, cover crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was just shattering all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I asked him about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, Oh, you know, I'd rather be
buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I then have to deal with the regular
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm curious what your thoughts are on
like, should we have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: weed seeds in order to promote the
microbes that that helped to suppress the
[SPEAKER_07]: bad weed seeds and is the approach because
people with the cover crop is to suppress
[SPEAKER_07]: weed seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're suppressing all the weed
seeds, and you've eliminated the host for
[SPEAKER_07]: the microbe, yeah, eat on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Curiously, if you could do it again,
or if you have some other thoughts about
[SPEAKER_07]: future directions for that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I've thought about doing that of
like, can we sort of like, select for you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, can we sort of like have some
incubation where you have soil and we
[SPEAKER_03]: crush up a bunch of weed seeds,
and we put them in and then we like take
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of community and we do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't sort of like have lots of
different generations over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And can we evolve microbes that are more
effective at infecting and killing weed
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am like just dipping my toe into this
microbial world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's definitely like something that
I'm thinking about and really interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I would need to buy a pipette
before we went that route.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I feel like we would need to sort of
drastically increase our capacity to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would definitely be interested like,
you know, working with a collaborator who
[SPEAKER_03]: actually had, you know, the capacity to
sort of do that type of work, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, be that sterile in it that you
would need to do in order to do something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it would definitely be
interesting to collaborate with someone
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, I would say that's sort
of like outside the range of like what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're capable of doing at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in your first area of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I missed it, but are seed decay
mainly by bacterial microbes or spunged
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes also?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did do ITS, but sort of like we are
like sort of dealing with that data right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just haven't, we haven't sort of like
figured out that story yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really like just got our sequencing
data back like two months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've sort of like got, we sort of got
the bacterial down, but we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of reason to believe that
fungi might be bigger players because
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds have such sort of like protective
seed codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I just want to sort of like add
a side note.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited for your seed biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Position to get filled because we really
need like more expertise in the world of
[SPEAKER_03]: people who sort of like understand these
seed defenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe, you know,
maybe that's the strategy that we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of like targeting these seed defenses
more than the microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but so there's a lot of reason to
believe that maybe fungi would be more
[SPEAKER_03]: effective at sort of like getting past
seed codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'm just not totally sure yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're kind of like dealing with that
data right now or working through it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully we'll have, you know,
like an amazing story in like two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Carolyn, I really appreciate that
you're tackling some of like the hardest
[SPEAKER_02]: questions because it is difficult to work
in these kind of natural environments that
[SPEAKER_02]: include soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question was about like the open top
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you started evaluating some of that
emergence, and could you have seen any
[SPEAKER_02]: possible emergence like in the fall,
like, you know, rather than when those
[SPEAKER_02]: species are naturally supposed to emerge,
could you have facilitated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like a fall emergence and then,
you know, a kilp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did was, you know, that first
year we collected the seeds and we put
[SPEAKER_03]: them out after temperatures got pretty
cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did experience winter in the OTCs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't experience sort of like
the pre summer or fall or sort of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, seed ripening on the plant or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the next year, we sort of kept
our plots in the same spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we respiked some seeds,
but we still sort of like had that
[SPEAKER_03]: population there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe we saw some effects,
but we couldn't really tease it out apart
[SPEAKER_03]: from like what happened the previous year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also what happened sort of like,
you know, the seeds that had been there
[SPEAKER_03]: for a year versus the ones that we
recently spiked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely something that I'm like
interested in looking at in the future and
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of also just thinking about like,
you know, can we tease apart sort of like
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence from like breaking dormancy?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so those are all sort of like I
would love to be able to like increase
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures even more than what we get
like by having something like soil heating
[SPEAKER_03]: cables to have more in effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think that there could be
some interesting questions about sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: like trying to tease apart dormancy
breaking versus like actual germination
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you mean like sort of like there might
have been like other environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: variation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the first year, we were kind of on
like a shoestring budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did not measure soil moisture
because I, you know, I just soil moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: sensors are so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we got an agnifigure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then we bought the soil sensors for
the second year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did see quite a lot of variation in how
they affect the soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I think we still need to
actually like statistically test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems like I would have expected
the open top chambers to have been drier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our data showing that wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were actually like points where
there was maybe a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were wondering, like,
could rainfall have been like running down
[SPEAKER_03]: the sides?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we are sort of measuring soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we want to take that into
account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the seeds are like in the soil,
and they like imbibe water from the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's possible that humidity could be
playing a factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that probably soil moisture
would be more important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often what people use to model
emergence is like, you know, they'll often
[SPEAKER_03]: use hydrothermal time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll sort of like be integrating
soil water potential into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another question from your your
first study with the microbial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed pall amaranth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pall amaranth is a really,
really, really small seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you do any other species,
you know, like the velvetleafs,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the fox tails that are going to be
larger seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, the velvetleaf also
has a hard seed coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually did have a second species.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had velvetleaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that was we actually did not
submit the velvetleaf seeds for
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why was because velvetleaf
was either gone, like we couldn't recover
[SPEAKER_03]: them or they were alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't have this sort of like some
seeds were dead, but we could still
[SPEAKER_03]: extract DNA from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some seeds were viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just viable or gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I think what happens
with velvetleaf is the moment that seed
[SPEAKER_03]: coat cracks, that hard seed coat cracks,
it's just like a free fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, that's all it invests all
of its defenses into that hard seed coat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that cracks, it's basically gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so yeah, I want to try more with
like some other species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pigweed really limited us because
what I wanted to do for that final time
[SPEAKER_03]: point was with viability testing,
you cut the seeds in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wanted for each individual seed
to submit half of the seed for viability
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, and then half would get frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we could pull all of the viable
seeds and look at all the data I presented
[SPEAKER_03]: was like this sample had this percent
mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this sample had this microbial
community, but I couldn't say this seed
[SPEAKER_03]: was dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was the microbe, you know,
and so it would have been nice to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kara Ecker, my master's student who
did all that work, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: She tried and like, if there's anything in
the world that can be done, Kara could do
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was getting so unbelievably
frustrated trying to do that, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, trying to preserve the seeds
enough so that she could do use half of
[SPEAKER_03]: the seed for both purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just was not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so I would like to do it with
larger seeds, that we could then actually
[SPEAKER_03]: have like a, you know, like, like,
really do more in depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed work by having half the seeds go to
viability testing, half the seeds go to
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a question, but I was wondering
if there's maybe anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing, nothing online.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering, the first
experiment, you highlighted a few
[SPEAKER_06]: bacterial species that were different
among the different populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just wondering if you looked them
up.
Yeah.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any sort of known function that maybe
could be related.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I go there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, this chitinophagia, all three of
these are wasn't a lot of information that
[SPEAKER_03]: I could find on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one is, you know, as the name
applies, sort of, it can break down
[SPEAKER_03]: chitin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, it's like a bacteria that
like breaks down chitin in viral,
[SPEAKER_03]: like in viruses or something like that,
like, I don't know, super weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, like, you know,
chitin is a really sort of like
[SPEAKER_03]: recalcitrant compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would make sense as
something that was good at breaking up
[SPEAKER_03]: down these recalcitrant compounds would be
good at infecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could see it was like very viral
focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little bit confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I can't remember which one of
these had some pathogenetic function sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of characterized by, by, I can't remember
if it was the crebella or the lysobacter,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the other one I like really could not
find that much information about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sort of like getting into
these micro functions and what they do
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of like a whole new area for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so, you know, it'd be
interesting to sort of like do future work
[SPEAKER_03]: and see, like, do we still get like,
if I was to bury seeds in a completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different field, let's just say a field
that was like two hours away, would I
[SPEAKER_03]: still see these same genera in the seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would be super
interesting to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that would really sort of like
support sort of like investigating whether
[SPEAKER_03]: or not these actually could be involved in
mortality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely a lot more work to be done,
but, you know, this sort of like sets up
[SPEAKER_03]: some potential future hypotheses that we
could test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to see, you know,
are these players that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: are these bacteria ones that we will
frequently find in these seeds and how
[SPEAKER_03]: much does it vary by species?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that could really sort of
set up support for actually testing
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not there's some
mechanistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at what the like naturally occurring,
sorry, microbial composition is in just
[SPEAKER_04]: the like oak soil or other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we so, you know, we did the sequencing
of the soil that was in proximity to the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we didn't do and again,
it was just sort of like I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of funding for this and sort of like
funding came later.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do like the starting microbial
community in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like before, like when we bury the seeds
and that is like, you know, when you have
[SPEAKER_03]: these like regrets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a regret.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I really have, you know, like I wish
we had done that because I'm wondering
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe what matters most is the microbial
community, like the moment seeds hit the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe that maybe those priority
effects are what govern govern this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had like the two and a half year
time point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to sequence the microbial
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found an effect of treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found a statistically significant
difference in our treat our the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: collected from our perennial forage
treatments with a permanova.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I tried to do like,
you know, principle coordinate analysis to
[SPEAKER_03]: see if I could visualize that difference,
they all looked very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that we need to sort of
like explore further with different sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of statistical techniques to be able to
figure out what sort of variation the
[SPEAKER_03]: community actually explains that
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that we're going to
explore further.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I really like I could go
back in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had that sort of soil,
but I don't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a quick question with the
principle coordinate analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering what the
dissimilarity metric was used and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: tried any other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only tried by Curtis since we haven't
tried any others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's something that we'll
probably be playing around with in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sort of seemed that like that's
what all the microbe people use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, all right, well,
that's what you all do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, you know, the more you get into
it, you realize that not all microbe
[SPEAKER_03]: people agree on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, so it's definitely something
that we're going to play around with a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit or maybe use other sort of
ordination techniques, look at NMDS,
[SPEAKER_03]: see if we can, you know, visualize some
differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing on chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, like, I'm not sure when you when
you all are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.

Thank you.
