[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the great
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put joy, sorrows, and
surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put the human side to it,
because we all know a lot of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting your careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a lot of sorrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have lots of surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a joyful journey to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least we find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that it's all worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been very interesting and
intriguing to work with peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in Embrapa, which is the Brazilian
corporation that's for agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with peanuts, when we started
15 years ago, there was very little known
[SPEAKER_00]: about peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of connections, but not much
known about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a grand total of six
microsatellite markers for peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mere act of extracting DNA was a
stumbling block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we found a very nice protocol,
which is Doyle and Doyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew Jeff Doyle before we knew him
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being here giving a seminar invited by
him, by V Doyle, it's a great pleasure and
[SPEAKER_00]: honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanted to do was, I think peanut
is not very well known in a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: places, although in the US, it's very
important, the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to give a sort of good
background on what peanut is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the wild species are like,
and why we work with wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the interesting findings we've
had in the last couple of years right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with peanut, I think most of
you think it's a good international
[SPEAKER_00]: community here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the American ones, United States
is a very big producer of peanuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a very big user.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you have had these in your school
years, peanut butter jelly sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're more from the south,
you may be familiar with these,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild peanuts, love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very important crop in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the US only produces 6%,
a lot of the production is here in China,
[SPEAKER_00]: in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is used for oil, or just
eaten, or for cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Africa is one of our passions,
is a place where peanut is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important in terms of staple food,
is where women are more involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The women and the children plant the
peanut a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a source of income for the
families, where a society is more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: male-dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of freedom that the
women have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to show these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plum peanut is something that is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created originally by a French
pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's like, in a packet,
food that is used for combating
[SPEAKER_00]: malnourishment for children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been some campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have children which are beyond
hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get a lot of perking up using
plum peanut or related products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that's really important
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Kenya, in a small supermarket,
you get more peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But products, and I've ever seen anywhere
else in the world, I think it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing the way they use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so important in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the first written record that
I've seen, that we looked at, was by
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonzalo Hernández de Oviedo Valdés.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a Spanish writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote chronicles in the times of the
great navigations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these was found in the Espanolas,
in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the context of the time
with the 1500s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So money, which is peanuts, is very common
with the Indians, with the native Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christians take a little comfort in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, they eat mostly by lowly men
and boys, slaves, and by people who do not
[SPEAKER_00]: pardon their taste for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really wasn't very appreciated like
it is nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting the way he sees the
way it's eaten by the native people.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 200 years later, it was just called
Arrakis Hypogea because of the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit bears in the soil, by Linnaeus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became very popular in the US by
George Washington Carver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a scientist, an inventor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought out 300 years of peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually quite famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his work, a lot of what we have
nowadays in peanuts in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: is derived from his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know if you can hear me at the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Louder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say if you can't hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arrakis Hypogea, it belongs to the
family of the Papillianidae, subfamily
[SPEAKER_00]: Papillianidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite basal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here with the psilocentes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the genus that is more
closely related to Arrakis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important feature of Arrakis is
the subterranean fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower, the ovary, the peg,
after the flower is pollenized,
[SPEAKER_00]: the peg grows into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the peg, the fruit is
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, because it's self-pollinating,
the fruit is under the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispersion is very poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have, in areas, you have
populations that stay there for hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So per year, you have dispersion of about
one meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine to go one kilometer,
take 1,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dispersion is very poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the dispersion of Arrakis has
been done by native people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the center of diversity, unlike a lot
of people think, so you think of Pena to
[SPEAKER_00]: think Africa, because a lot of it made all
its way to Africa in pre-Columbian times
[SPEAKER_00]: by the primary centers actually in South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: These region the north of Argentina,
south of Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these lines are migration lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see anthropologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the field work for
anthropologists, because these are
[SPEAKER_00]: migration lines of the native Amerindians.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first archaeological remains of
something looking like a peanut were found
[SPEAKER_00]: in Peru about 8,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very interesting
civilization, the Moche, again in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very interesting pottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very well-developed
civilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you Google Moche pottery,
it's very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among lots of interesting pottery,
some of them look like peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And showing the importance of peanuts in
their society.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that, I think it's really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, they found remains of the Lord
of Sipan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: They traded in gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had very sophisticated clothes,
ornaments, and they had very interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, probably religious traditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lord of Sipan was one of the most
important persons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at his necklace, all made of
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one side was gold, the other was
silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows the sun and the moon,
so all into the peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been very important in South
America for hundreds or maybe thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still being used by native
Brazilian Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: These is Kayabe Indians in the reservation
of Shingu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow something looking like a
land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these peanuts here, they do not fit
into any of the six botanical varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being thought now that this area
is one of the new centers of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's being established now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the origin is here in the north of
Argentina and south of Bolivia,
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the verge of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that is remarkable about it
is that for many years, researchers looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at what were the progenitors of peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you well established now that Arachis
ipaensis and Arachis durianensis are the
[SPEAKER_00]: two most likely progenitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arachis durianensis, there are several
accessions in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the area of occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Arachis ipaensis has only been found
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after going back there, they never
found this population anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably extinct in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, we were very lucky to be able
to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the joys of working
with peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the progenitors are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the closest related species to Arachis
ipaensis, which is Arachis magna,
[SPEAKER_00]: is found here, about 500 kilometers away,
lower down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very clear that there was the
work of men in the creation and the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: of peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were probably growing these
accessions, these plants, in small
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some pollinization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to show this in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peanuts is an allotetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start thinking about genetics,
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had some stumbling blocks along the
way because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the most likely progenitor is
Arachis durianensis, which is a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called A genome because there's a
small chromosome, which is called the A
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome in the centromeric bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Arachis ipaensis, at some point,
they crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this diploid hybrid,
which was infertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through spontaneous replication,
there was a tetraploidization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it created something, a rose that is
similar to what we know peanut nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: but obviously through domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are very interested in what made
the people at the time realize that this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was tetraploid and was more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could actually give rise to
something which is so different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can imagine, since peanut is a
tetraploid and the wild species are
[SPEAKER_00]: diploids, that created a tremendous
bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cannot find, we cannot cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cross them, you get some
infertile triploids, which are useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in nature, you have these diploid
species, which are already quite separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the peanut, which is
tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely isolated from its wild
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gene flow is irrelevant, is very
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This very old slide, very, very old slide
from maybe 10 years ago, showing
[SPEAKER_00]: microsatellite markers in different
accessions, in different actually
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found very, very little
polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been a problem for peanut,
very little polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accessions of the same species in
wilds, we find all sorts of polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our missions and our roles in
what we do is to bring wild alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring nutrients, to help with genetics
in peanuts, and to increase resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, again, an old photo,
again, 10 years ago, of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic allotetraploid produced by a
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the synthetic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a spontaneous fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus, sometimes in the greenhouse,
you have virus, you have fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have all sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peanuts got completely fried,
completely devastated with the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the synthetic was still happy alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, of course, we knew about
resistances, but this was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that came spontaneously in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept this for posterity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the wild species are
distributed in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see a lot of river flows,
river areas here, and we see also,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look more closely, a lot of
migration routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd like to point out this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an isolated patch of a
rachisteno-sperma, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most resistant plants, species of peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't see, you can see that it's
clearly taken by Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find this isolated population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find other populations around other
parts of Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many evidences of people
carrying peanut seeds or arachid seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And arachids is found in all sorts of
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it evolved in all sorts of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been a lot of effort for
collection, for understanding what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are like and identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the three people who are
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of them are deceased now,
but these are the three most important
[SPEAKER_00]: people who work with peanuts, who
understand about wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Charles Simpson from Texas A&M,
Guillermo Sejo from Argentina,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jose Valls, who I'm a colleague with
in Embrapa, Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several banks, geoplasmic banks,
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the most important ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to point out that until the
Convention of Biodiversity, geoplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange was much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the USDA in America,
I think there are about 70% of the species
[SPEAKER_00]: which have been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time when people could go to
Brazil, to Argentina, to South America to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect, they would leave a part there and
bring some to the USDA and also transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: to other places, other banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the conventions, this all became
very difficult to exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brazil and in Argentina, national laws
stop researchers from sending native
[SPEAKER_00]: materials abroad and make it actually
quite difficult to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite difficult to work with native
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICUSAT has an amazing bank of cultivated
species of accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the mandate to keep and to
distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, again, some issues which are
beyond the scope of the of this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to get material
from ICUSAT, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the USDA, I mean, we've been having a
lot of pleasure working with the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have a very well-organized
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's transparent, everything's online,
and it's very easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make a request to the USDA,
you get a little packet of 20 seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're very, very well-organized and
obliging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very good bank, and it's going
to be very important to keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been trying to work with the
USDA and convince funders and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's important to keep it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work we're doing producing new
tetraploids, our objective is to have it
[SPEAKER_00]: all deposited in the USDA, the work we do
here in the US, so that it's available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the penal community worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as expected, wild species have all
sorts of resistance to pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the main pests and diseases
of peanuts, as somebody was asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: today, late leaf spot, root-knot nematode,
rust, aflatoxin, viruses, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all of these, some species have
been found to be resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our work, and this is work from
starting some years back, we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: Arachis magna, which is a bee genome
species, was extremely resistant to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, this is not Arachis magna,
this is peanut, but this is just showing
[SPEAKER_00]: what the rust is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arachis tendosperm is very,
very resistant to nematode, amongst other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanut not having a very good,
easy genetics to work with, not being
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphic enough, and not being very
resistant at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work with diploids to bring in
resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we understand where the
resistances are?
[SPEAKER_00]: So remembering that peanut has A and B
genomes, so we decided to tease out the
[SPEAKER_00]: two genomes of peanut by using two
different diploid populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cross Arachis ipaensis, which is the
progenitor of peanut, with the bee genome
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arachis duranensis, the progenitor of the
A part of subgenome, with a B genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bee genome species with Arachis
tendosperma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in parallel, we created populations
for the A and for the B sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created maps, phenotyped for not only
these, but for all sorts of other traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identified QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created markers for resistance,
linked to resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use these markers now to do
markers selection with peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, these plants are not very
useful because they are in the diploid
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do in parallel to it is
building bridges, creating plants which
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually compatible and harbor the
other resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we cross a wild species
from A genome with a wild bee genome
[SPEAKER_00]: species and artificially duplicate the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use colchicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all sorts of things you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this synthetic plant now is now
compatible with peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use it directly with crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are theoretically stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite like that, but they are supposed
to be quite stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use them freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the species which are
theoretically crossable with peanut once
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Arachis ipaensis, which falls
into the Arachis hypochondrii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arachis hypogea B genome clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arachis durinensis that falls into the
Arachis hypogea A genome clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are introns for different genomes,
the genome size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these ones with the sign are the ones
that we have used in crosses and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: obtained successfully tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried other combinations,
but not everything's crossable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're deprezigotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all sorts of incompatibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we have never studied very much,
but we know they exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to select the ones that are
closer to the genome of hypogea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have been able to get crosses from
other more decent species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done crosses in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done crosses here at UGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in collaboration with Tifton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in collaboration with Senegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've created a number of plants which
are compatible with peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are doing back crosses here in the
US, in Brazil, and also in Senegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the place where wild species are
being used in breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones in yellow are the ones we are
collaborating with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to go into some
specifics, some aspects, which are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: we find very interesting, very surprising,
very interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we duplicate the plants, when we get
these two wild together, what happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in the genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the plant look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of you here are very familiar
with all this concept of nucleotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, of genomic merger, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to be surprising for a
lot of you, but for us was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a species which has a small leaf
crossed with another one, and we get
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicate, and we get a bigger leaf,
much more similar to the tetraploid one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't happen only once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in all the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the cell size in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the guard cells here of the
diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the guard cells of the
tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidermal cells as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at photosynthetic pigments,
again, so the yellow ones are the
[SPEAKER_00]: diploids, green ones are the synthetic
tetraploids, and blue is peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see is that once we
tetraploidize the diploid, we get a much
[SPEAKER_00]: greater level of production of
photosynthetic pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would be the effect on
drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of course, we've been involved in
a number of projects that involve drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, so let's look at the wilds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are grown in very dry
environments, so we could try and find
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles from the wilds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find it is not quite like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll show you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at drought, how can you
compare the drought of a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a peanut, which is a bushy plant,
which has an architecture which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, and compare with a plant which
is craggy, which has less branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: less leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you compare yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you compare growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to tease it out a bit and find
some traits which would be common to
[SPEAKER_00]: peanuts and to the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was the transpiration
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this work in collaboration with
Vincent Vadez, a colleague from his
[SPEAKER_00]: French.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works at Recursat India.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing a lot of wonderful work with
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the transpiration rate on
the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is in a pot 100% of water,
which is in field capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is zero water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fraction of transpirable soil water
is measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the measurement of the stress
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the normalized transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this stage in which you stop
watering the plant, or you water it in
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts that you know that the soil is
getting dry gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you observe the transpiration of the
plant compared to the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing really is tomato
conductance, how the stomata is closing
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the plant is reacting to the
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is called a threshold in which
the plant stops, really slows down
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration in response to the drought
imposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, the later the plant closes the
stomata and sort of defends itself against
[SPEAKER_00]: the drought, obviously you wilt more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant loses more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, it's producing
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a trade off between photosynthesis
and transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the threshold when it begins to decline
shows the water conservation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started looking at all the number of
wild species and compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrapods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the diploids are much more
conservative than the tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tendency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done lots of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the diploids start closing
stomata much earlier than the peanuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we started looking at one combination
of two diploids and their synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that the parental
diploids close the stomata earlier than
[SPEAKER_00]: the synthetic tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we realize that there is a lot of
changes in the plant once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cannot infer what the plant,
what type of drought tolerance the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have according to the diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through the whole process
of tetraploidizing first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you assess the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at what they're like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another one of the,
for us at the time, surprise of this
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other surprise was the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything grows, the leaves are
bigger, the plant is bigger, produces more
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments, it produces more this and the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focus of peanuts is the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great, we duplicate the plant and we're
going to have bigger seeds.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of our sorrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dear, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we have the bigger seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's not one cross,
one combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of combinations, we see the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the synthetic tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the rachis monticula, which is the
undomesticated form of peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the only tetraploid species
which are wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are peanuts, different peanut
varieties of different seed size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The length, the width, the weight,
we don't see much change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some discussions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't figured out why, but that's one
of the things that we've been finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the good thing about it is once we
cross, this plant, which is a tetraploid
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible with peanut, we get an F2
population with a lot of segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few rounds of selection,
we find we can recover plants which have
[SPEAKER_00]: good resistance and also have good seed
size, even larger than the original
[SPEAKER_00]: recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We managed to overcome that quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at over 30 traits and we find
consistent changes with tetraploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens in the genome structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we look, well, the plant
changes, so what happens in the genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to point out that after a lot
of work trying to find markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I know, over 10 tetraploid maps
have been created so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top ones are the ones our group is
involved with, and these are later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them, they follow the
assumption that peanut is an
[SPEAKER_00]: allotetraploid with this summary
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these use this classic
allotetraploid model in which you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: A genome, let's say, and the B genome,
and the recombination happens
[SPEAKER_00]: independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have recombination the A side and
recombination the B side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, well, this is a work
we've done recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had datasets from different maps and we
found that some markers behaved not the
[SPEAKER_00]: way we expected it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really follow the somic
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at these marks and we
thought, these are markers that don't work
[SPEAKER_00]: very well, they haven't amplified very
well, or the DNA is not working,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of it we just ignore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what we do when we don't have
an explanation, we just have to ignore and
[SPEAKER_00]: move on, otherwise we stay on forever in
the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the markers we just pushed
under the carpet, we just ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one example of a state marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are evaluating the A side,
we expect only three groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the A side, we expect just AA,
AC, or CC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, look at the A side, AC, you see AA,
AC, or CC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often, we found some markers which are
not supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why do you have this group here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can only explain with this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably are having a recombination
between the A and the B genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these we found consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we sort of click, that was about two
years ago, about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we were in Pag and I saw a talk
on potato and I thought, hang on,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something here that maybe we are
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked back at all our data,
microsatellite data, SNP data,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also expression analysis data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that these strange markers,
they were grouping into similar positions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chromosomes, the lichens groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we find here, the green parts are
areas where we have tetrasomic for A
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a higher dosage of the A,
and nollisomic for the B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red is tetrasomic for B,
and nollisomic for A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started looking at this data,
and this is a cross between a pinot
[SPEAKER_00]: variety and a synthetic allotetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could easily establish that this is
a segmental allotetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, at the time of sequencing the
genome of epinecy, syndurinases,
[SPEAKER_00]: is tetrasomic recombination a big problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a big issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a small issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we deal with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to create, what are the
new models we are going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still haven't answered that,
but what new models are we going to use to
[SPEAKER_00]: start mapping pinot now?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that going to affect our breeding
programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to affect selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first pinot genome, which is not
actually pinot, but is the pinot
[SPEAKER_00]: progenitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinot progenitors have been recently
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versions of it have been available since
2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a multi-national initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because pinot is allotetraploid,
the two subgenomes are so similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: we decided as a group to sequence the two
progenitors, arachisipaensis and
[SPEAKER_00]: arachisdurinensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, as I said, has been deposited
in pinot base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been freely available for almost two
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being curated by the group of
Steve Cannon from Iowa State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a very good source of
information for the whole pinot community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can start answering some of
these questions with the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the crosses that involve
wild species have a good degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrasomic recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much of that actually happens or
affect pinot genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you have wild, you may have
more wild things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about pinot itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some short-read Illumina
sequence, some skin sequencing from
[SPEAKER_00]: several pinot genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we mapped those sequences,
because we're going to have a mix of A and
[SPEAKER_00]: B subgenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mapped them onto the arachisipaensis
of the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we designed some plots,
some random plots of these sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have, which is the expected model
of A and B in the same dosage,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a plot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have the normalized density,
A and B equals 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have something that deviates
from this model, again, the plots are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have four of B, then the density
goes higher, and the A goes lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very simple plot that I'm
going to show you, the ones in real life
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sequenced about 40 genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show one genotype and three
linkage groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are linkage group one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is most of it is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see along with the most of the
linkage group, you see the same dosage for
[SPEAKER_00]: A and for B.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some small deletions or maybe
gene conversion, something we still don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see small variation along the
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linkage group four is a total different
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These linkage group four harbors lots of
RGAs, lots of resistant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are highly collinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A and the B, chromosome fours are
highly collinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here at the end, low dosage for
A, then low dosage for B, then for A
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been a lot of recombination
going on there between the two genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a similar thing in linkage
group five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in which you see about six million base
pairs of tetrasomic recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to analyze this data,
but we already see a lot of very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they vary between different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are looking at different
botanical varieties, we start to see some
[SPEAKER_00]: trends for the different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see some trends for Arachas
monticula, which is the wild tetraploid
[SPEAKER_00]: peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're beginning to think that this
issue is quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's larger than we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you're happy or sad
about it, but it's something completely
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected and quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's something that we're
beginning to touch now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the effects of tetraploidization
on gene expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a few of you here vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with the whole concept of
differences in gene expression when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have genome merger, when you have
tetraploidization, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that we are just
beginning to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a very, very nice model for
it, because we have the two progenitors of
[SPEAKER_00]: peanut, Arachas ipaens and Doreneensis,
recently created new diploid hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are able to look at the diploid
hybrid before you weren't able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we thought the diploid hybrid
didn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We threw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they're different plants,
difficult plants to keep because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep them vegetatively,
so not often are you able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now with the new, knowing a bit more
about it, we look at these plants with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have new synthetic allotetraploids,
because before we thought they were
[SPEAKER_00]: completely stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are not so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have synthetic allotetraploid tenth
generation, so we can see roughly what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened along all these rounds of
selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Arachas monticula,
which is the one species of wild peanut,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably a feral species,
a feral relative of peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be what peanut looked like
thousands of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very nice model to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did RNA-seq-of-leaves mapped,
again, onto the duranensis, and it binds
[SPEAKER_00]: to the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plots that I'm going to show,
I made them on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely out of the oven,
completely new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still trying to understand what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So linkage group one, again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the peanut cultivars, not much
going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know if you can see the new diploid
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete B dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens when the tetraploid
dies, then you have a very good A and B
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may need to saturate this data a bit
and do some more tweaking, but it's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: clear here that something really dramatic
is happening between this stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: diploidization to the tetraploidization.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the 10th generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different synthetic to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same parentals, but done at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 10th generation, we don't see much
dominance at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Arachis monticula, which is a
wild species of peanut, and peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have a look at domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something happened here, but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So possibly they were very unstable in the
first generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, there's a complete
balance of the two subgenomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked at linkage group four,
in which you have a lot of tritosomic
[SPEAKER_00]: recombination here at the ends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, linkage group four, the new diploid
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not complete, but a very good A and
B dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when it's tetraploidized,
there's A and B balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, look at the 10th generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These doesn't come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a direct thing, because this is
from a different cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see is this plant that
we've had for 10 generations look very
[SPEAKER_00]: stable, looks completely the same as 10th
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago, when you look at the linkage
group four, you see complete A dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, almost complete A dominance,
but not quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not because this is not a gene
expression thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is genomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some work before that that we
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's complete tetra-somic recombination
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more a genomic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at Arachis monticula,
you see at the ends the same signature of
[SPEAKER_00]: tetra-somic recombination we see in
Arachis monticula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also saw the same, very similar
signature in pinnat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, these are very preliminary
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are beginning to unravel very
interesting factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some things seem to be very
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a lot of great instability in
the first generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more work to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something we are very excited
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going through the sorrows and joys and
surprises, the first sorrow is pinnat is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nanotetraploid with very low genetic
diversity and very poor disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been crying like my son with his
foot stuck on the bench because we felt
[SPEAKER_00]: completely stuck for a number of years
with having to go forward and get along
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the prickly part is pinnat has a more
complex genetics than we expected before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite prickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's something we can deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having a lot of success in
improving disease resistance with wild
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles now with the new genome 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a consequence, we can go much
faster and it's much nicer to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: than previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I wanted to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to acknowledge the funders of
this research and the group I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my colleague, partner,
husband that we've been working with for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 15 years on this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great joy to work with,
David Bertielli.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my, is the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's many more people than
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students, post-docs, but this is the core
group in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to point to Zervals,
who's the one who's been collecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing the genome plasma banks and
he's a great asset to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the wonderful group of being,
we're having the pleasure to work with in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to point out Scott Jackson,
who's our host and friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we've been having great joy
working with and thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll ask you one.
[SPEAKER_03]: For starters, have you made any
autotetraploids?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if you made those,
whether you would get some of the same
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities and then cost those to make
your... Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some experiments,
some crazy experiments we thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: and we like making octaploid, all
autotetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be some things that we
thought of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we are very much interested in
application and all the crosses we make,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are looking at the science behind it,
but we are always looking at if we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: some product at the end of the line from
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking specifically about the
issue of the variability between diploids
[SPEAKER_03]: and the tetraploids states.
[SPEAKER_03]: You made the tetraploids first,
could you then assess for disease
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance or other qualities and then...
Right, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So duplicate the two diploids and then
cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the topic of disease resistance,
you mentioned that on occasion like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: your progenitor species, you're
interviewing progenitor people on the
[SPEAKER_01]: street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for the diseases you've been
screening and been investigating,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you finding that those specifically
for apatocines are considered as diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you finding that there are really
effective large effects both sides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you finding that there are a lot of RG
progenitor species that are more captured
[SPEAKER_01]: or are you finding that that is more about
many different both sides that take that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific progenitor for apatocines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, great, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, obviously, aflatoxin is
something that is interesting to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people from different crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our group, we haven't done work directly
with aflatoxin ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done is we created some
tetraploids and in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Senegal, they've been looking at,
they've been doing field trials for
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been assessing aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what they're finding is that
some of these, I think they are in BC,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have segmental lines, they have some
advanced lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the lines are more resistant than
the recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they find the very small, the additive
effect and they don't have anything of
[SPEAKER_00]: major effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is additive and of small
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the organeller genomes play any role
either in the success of the crosses or
[SPEAKER_04]: the behaviour of the organellers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's something we haven't looked at,
no, we haven't looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that is puzzling because I
think it evolved independently in other
[SPEAKER_00]: two taxa in legumes, but they're not
necessarily related to arachids at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Vigno subterranean is one of them and
it's far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the arachid species have
subterranean fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the transphictum right now,
I know it's fresh out, but if you correct
[SPEAKER_02]: on the genomic allele usage, do you find
any residual expression control that's
[SPEAKER_02]: biased from one or the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously what we're showing here were
two different things in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the genetic side of it,
the other the expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't corrected that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's one of the next steps to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, there isn't any arachids species
that is haploid that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working and all the species
that are in the arachids section that we
[SPEAKER_00]: work with that across the board deployed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
