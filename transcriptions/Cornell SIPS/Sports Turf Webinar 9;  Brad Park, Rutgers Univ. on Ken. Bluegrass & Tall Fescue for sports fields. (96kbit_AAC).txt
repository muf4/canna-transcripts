[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as always, we have our guest on today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, Brad Park from Rutgers
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really happy to have Brad on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about some tall
fescue, so maybe some traffic tolerance of
[SPEAKER_03]: tall fescues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know those are going in a little bit
more in sports fields up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll chat about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as always, Frank will start us off
with a little preview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us Jones and for baseball,
can you hear me, Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us Jones and for baseball,
this might be what it's going to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes back to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is South Korean players now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems surreal to see such a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, you know, we're wrapping up about
10 weeks of doing this with you guys now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that everybody's busy, we're going to
take a hiatus and let everybody get busy
[SPEAKER_00]: to their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that these shows have been useful,
distracting, enjoyable, fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educational, all the things that we've
been trying to do in getting us through
[SPEAKER_00]: the first part of this long haul on this
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really grateful for our
colleagues like Brad Park that have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the time out to join us for the fastest 30
minutes in turf as we've started to count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a little quick weather review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we heard again on Thursday
mornings, we have the benefit of hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: from our climate center expert,
Arti Gaetano on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a weekly call very, very early in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been chatting to Rich with Rich
Buckley for 20 years now, Brad,
[SPEAKER_00]: on this call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've been on it with us a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still well behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we were much warmer up North here
than you were down there to the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see ideal conditions
from a heat perspective to do weed control
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're able to do weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I've said to school grounds
people, without the students around,
[SPEAKER_00]: this might be a good time to ask for an
emergency exemption to make some broadleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have a pesticide license
or if there's funds available to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is one important point we've made a
number of weeks ago that weedy fields are
[SPEAKER_00]: not safe fields, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The footing that you get from these
different plants out there requires a
[SPEAKER_00]: safety intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any or minimal exposure,
there's opportunities now to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I'd recommend spring as the
best time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall is typically gonna be a better time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing it in the spring,
models and things like this can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unusually dry now for much of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're starting to see some drought
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard from Dave Chinnery this morning
on the left here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Frank, we lost your audio here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little choppy, but we'll see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's going to be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming into some of the driest time
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing grass on sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat's building and we're starting to
see some heat stress, certainly in central
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey, south, north Jersey and south.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the heat stress in a little
bit cooler by the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are starting to warm, upper fees,
low 60s, upper 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see everything's plugging along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not consistent warmth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not consistent warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topic for today, hope my internet holds
out, Brad, is really the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: species and variety selection for sports
fields and particularly with regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been very hot on these hybrid
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Munshaw has been playing around with
this and they're finding that not unlike
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've been finding in the cool
season grass arena, that the varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use in these cases matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the permutative varieties are a
little bit limited because you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: with maybe more cold tolerant ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, the bluegrass variety
seems to have a big impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Doug sold that, just tweeted this out
last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug's had some long-term stuff going on
at the University of Wisconsin,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at different varieties and seeing
that variety makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weediness and color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right here you have the
kingfisher variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kingfisher variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is zero fertilizer, two pounds and
four pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the impact that it has on
weediness in this particular case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Brad, I know you've been doing this
work with traffic simulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the KD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the sweeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we go through some of this work,
I want to make sure you clarify it for me
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some old work you did looking at
Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some recent work done with
Kentucky bluegrass varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I thought you
concluded here was really interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons of traffic seem to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also did, and you looked at
different varieties here, but let's stop
[SPEAKER_00]: here for a second, Brad, and bring you
into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back so you can see my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about this bluegrass study
first, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk a little bit about this work and
this bluegrass data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the different types of
bluegrasses that people can pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many might not be familiar with the
Rutgers way of characterizing bluegrasses
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys pioneered years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the different types of
bluegrasses, and then we'll get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonality of their traffic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as the types, I think just a
little bit of a review for everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: participating.
[SPEAKER_04]: What bluegrass types involve is a
characterization of individual varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Individual experimental selections
previously was based on their growth,
[SPEAKER_04]: their performance characteristics,
their appearance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Josh Honig, Dr. Bill Meyer have taken
it to an additional level where now
[SPEAKER_04]: they've introduced DNA fingerprinting and
genotyping into this, where they can look
[SPEAKER_04]: at individual bluegrass varieties,
experimental selections, and now group
[SPEAKER_00]: them together genetically, but it's- And
what is the significance of these
[SPEAKER_00]: differences, Brad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with their differences
relative to traffic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what's so important is from
a blending perspective, where if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to put two or more bluegrasses
together to kind of improve the genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity, so to speak, within the blend,
it's important not only to look at
[SPEAKER_04]: individual varieties, but also try to
select varieties across types.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, the compact midnight
types, the midnight types are a group of
[SPEAKER_04]: bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass,
so they're actually very similar as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: their growth, their performance
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very slow to green up in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually do have very good summer
performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: They maintain their winter color long into
the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have very dark green color,
pretty good summer patch tolerance,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they are generally very, very slow to
green up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not good for lacrosse in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think if it's a very early season
lacrosse, which is a difficult sport to
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with just in general, but I just
think the expectation on the part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: turf manager has to be, okay, these things
are going to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things are going to green up very,
very slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they get going though, they have
good, they're pretty wear and traffic
[SPEAKER_04]: tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that's interesting to
me is what I think Doug is getting at in
[SPEAKER_00]: some ways is that newer varieties seem to
be dependent on being fertilized
[SPEAKER_00]: routinely, more recently developed
improved low cut blue grasses generally
[SPEAKER_00]: require more intense maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm willing to do that, Brad,
if I get more traffic tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there something there between the
common types like Ken blue or some older
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that might actually be better for
wear tolerance rather than some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: new ones that will be better with
fertilizer, but the old ones will be
[SPEAKER_00]: better with minimal inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see what I'm getting at?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the one thing that you've got to
be a little bit careful with some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: older blue grasses is susceptibility to
leaf spot, particularly in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's different than the gray leaf spot
that affects rye grasses and now tall
[SPEAKER_04]: fescue, but that is a challenge with the
Ken blues and some of the kind of the
[SPEAKER_04]: common types that the susceptibility to
the leaf spot caused by Drushlara by
[SPEAKER_04]: Polaris, that's a challenge with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I think that they do persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do persist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the less you do, the more they
persist, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the other thing that just
to add with bluegrass, I think the
[SPEAKER_04]: establishment year is pretty critical and
particularly from a fertilization
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint where you really want to get
these things in the ground seeded,
[SPEAKER_04]: latter part of August through the month of
September, and then be maybe be vigilant,
[SPEAKER_04]: use that term, with fertilization to just
make sure that they fill in and to get
[SPEAKER_04]: that canopy to fill in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as bluegrass ages,
I do think the end need does subside,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that first, that fall and then that
subsequent spring, I think it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: important to- All right, so let me bug you
now to move on to the tall fescues and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're going to bring them together in
the mixture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've also done similar traffic work
with the turf type tall fescues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spend a couple of hours reviewing
some of your work before we get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the quote at the very end of
the paper that actually struck me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sometimes the things we select
grasses for like dark blue, green and fine
[SPEAKER_00]: texture, don't necessarily translate to
the functional performance that we always
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is work from, I think one of the
international proceedings from 2009 or I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the long and the short of it is,
have we selected for really good looking
[SPEAKER_00]: bluegrass tall fescue types and have we
sacrificed some traffic tolerance because
[SPEAKER_00]: of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me say this about the newest tall
fescue trial, the 2018 test.
[SPEAKER_04]: We initiated traffic last fall on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually just yesterday just ran
kind of a real basic correlation between
[SPEAKER_04]: the quality ratings that I took,
which when I rate for quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't put a real strong bias towards
color.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's more of a uniformity issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a density issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those quality and traffic tolerance
ratings were just as far as a linear
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were linearly related.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the quality relationship, again,
I think where the evaluator is putting a
[SPEAKER_04]: premium on things like density and
uniformity, and then traffic tolerance,
[SPEAKER_04]: that relationship is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've touched on the things that
are important for traffic tolerance and
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat aesthetic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a dense uniform turf,
independent of the color, it may be off
[SPEAKER_00]: putting from a greenness perspective,
but ultimately it's gonna be more traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many ways, our focus on traffic
tolerance keeps us safe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some measure that that's a safer
field if it's dense and uniform,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, Brad?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just the uniformity issue in and
of itself where you're establishing
[SPEAKER_04]: traffic tolerant varieties, cultivars,
species, doing a good job of species
[SPEAKER_04]: selection, and you've got a uniform
surface versus a surface that just doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have the uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, let me follow up because you
really got yourself going there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute on the establishment thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a key to some of the
challenges we have with both bluegrass and
[SPEAKER_00]: tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, it wasn't until you
could get good tall fescue bluegrass sod
[SPEAKER_00]: that you started to see more tall fescue
into the landscape because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we would recommend you just
put out there like you put out ryegrass
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the potential for
non-uniformity in leaf texture,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're overseeding a ryegrass field
with tall fescue and it gets clumpy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be off putting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ability to put these things
together and then sell it as sod is also
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you've been looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we'll put links to a lot of
this work that people can follow up and
[SPEAKER_00]: review this yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your work here with Murph on these
combinations is very interesting because
[SPEAKER_00]: brown patch severity is a weak link for
tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you put the more Kentucky
bluegrass you put in there, it seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the amount of brown patch you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and I wonder if you could explain
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the bluegrass variety impact the
amount of brown patch that maybe a tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fescue variety that was weak in it got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the percentage of bluegrass or was
there something about that cultivar that
[SPEAKER_00]: kept the brown patch from getting severe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what's really important to
recognize about this study is that the
[SPEAKER_04]: bluegrass cultivar selection was really
what governed the performance of these
[SPEAKER_04]: mixtures from a standpoint of everything
from brown patch severity to speaking
[SPEAKER_04]: composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the two really strong bluegrasses that
we investigated were blue note and
[SPEAKER_04]: midnight two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are very high quality,
high performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compact midnights?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, blue note is a compact America type.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually got a little bit lighter
color, a little bit earlier green up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very quality variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Midnight two, a little slower green up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once it gets going, I think it's about
as good as anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't associate brown patch
typically with Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those also separate out for brown patch
susceptibility?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what happened in that study
is that the inclusion of those cultivars,
[SPEAKER_04]: they really tended to dominate the tall
fescue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that brown patch, we employed a fairly
complex statistical analysis in the study,
[SPEAKER_04]: but basically the inclusion of those
cultivars in the mixes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as those bluegrass, those aggressive
bluegrasses dominated the mixtures with
[SPEAKER_04]: tall fescue, I think what you were seeing
from a brown patch perspective was just
[SPEAKER_04]: the bluegrass becoming a more predominant
component in the mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that what happens to these sods if
you put them in the ground as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the best ones are planted what,
90, 10 in the field, 90 tall fescue,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it to the field probably 50,
50 in some cases, maybe more bluegrass
[SPEAKER_00]: than tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the sod down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it then just become a bluegrass or
does it also sometimes become a tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fescue stand?
[SPEAKER_04]: What our research suggests is that that
transition over to bluegrass is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be a function of the bluegrass cultivar
selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this kind of goes against what we
traditionally recommend is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: agronomist and extension people always
choose the best variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: The catch-22, so to speak, of all this is
that some of these better bluegrasses,
[SPEAKER_04]: while we want to use those, when they're
mixed with tall fescue, that could
[SPEAKER_04]: facilitate that transition over to a
predominant bluegrass mixture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the question kind of gets
back to, you know, you were bringing up
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these common types and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do you, if the goal is to have
as much tall fescue in that mixture as
[SPEAKER_04]: desired and that to be a long-term
component of the mix, do you really need a
[SPEAKER_04]: high-end Kentucky bluegrass cultivar in
that mixture?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want something that is going to
perform the role as being rhizomatous so
[SPEAKER_04]: that that sod can be lifted and then
provide some insurance against brown
[SPEAKER_04]: patch, which we know tall fescue has got,
you know, there's a big challenge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in some ways that Blue Muta idea is
the same way that it feels like these
[SPEAKER_00]: things are helping each other through the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I'm wondering is,
are we having issues with sod growers
[SPEAKER_00]: using the weaker bluegrass varieties
because they typically don't want to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: those varieties for their bluegrass sod?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of all over the map.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a facility that I'm familiar with
that established a bluegrass, they
[SPEAKER_04]: purchased a sod, bluegrass tall fescue
mixture.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue grasses were not top shelf blue
grasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still a lot of tall fescue in
the, you know, in the mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, from the objective of kind
of having a tall fescue turf or having a
[SPEAKER_04]: significant part of the turf being tall
fescue going forward, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that mix that the grower established,
you know, it's achieving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much is going to be related to what
happens when you put sod down,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you lay sod down, certainly,
you know, comes juice probably from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sod producers field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a sports field, you know,
there'll always be, let me get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're giving it some more end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm wondering how much that
always tends to favor the bluegrass over
[SPEAKER_00]: the tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done on our campuses,
we've strived to put more tall fescue in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't paid as much attention to the
varieties I think, like you've said,
[SPEAKER_00]: sod growers, we don't always get the
choices that we want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the limitations of sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we put it in and we don't really do
anything but mow it and overseed it and
[SPEAKER_00]: aerify it once a year, overseed it just to
get more tall fescue in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, those have become beautiful
stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't barely find the bluegrass in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become dominant tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much does the management then
determine how much tall fescue you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have thinking that more fur means
more bluegrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that logical?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, I think anything higher
cutting heights and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: less nitrogen, you know, lower kind of
annual nitrogen quantities,
[SPEAKER_04]: lower, you know, just less frequent
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anything that's going to,
you know, kind of it's gonna provide the
[SPEAKER_04]: tall fescue an advantage, you know,
it's gotta help.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think having the control over
kind of what you're doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have the opportunity to establish
for a field for the first time and you
[SPEAKER_04]: can, you know, you can really drill down
on that seeding rate, maybe even want to
[SPEAKER_04]: go to a, you know, a 95, 5, 95% tall
fescue, 5% Kentucky bluegrass by weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that, you know, I think is
another, you know, you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, I think it's worth giving it
a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see, do you see that kind of,
do you see those things available?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my questions on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you and I can talk out the kazoo
about this variety, that variety and the
[SPEAKER_00]: varietal differences within a species can
be as big as the differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tall fescue varieties within a
tall fescue can be as different as tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fescue and Kentucky bluegrass species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, do you find that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find a lot of 95 fives on the
marketplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find seed companies willing to work
with us on this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't mean it doesn't exist,
but I don't, I don't, I don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you decide?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does somebody decide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it maintenance?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would I decide if I'm starting out,
whether I should have a bluegrass or tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fescue field or go with that blend?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put you on the spot of how
you get about deciding what to go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this whole thing allows you to do some
renovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think first of all, having a discussion
about what the anticipated management
[SPEAKER_04]: inputs are going to be going forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think if, you know,
if the objective is lower, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: fewer nitrogen inputs, less irrigation
going forward, a higher cutting height,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I think, you know, I think a
tall fescue bluegrass mixture and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: having the bluegrass in there does provide
a little bit of a, a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_04]: insurance policy, particularly on the,
particularly on the brown patch issue here
[SPEAKER_04]: in, here in central New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's, that's, that's a legitimate,
legitimate concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but it's, let's say a school
municipality, new construction project.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to go for seed, you know,
you wanted to start something from seed
[SPEAKER_04]: and even with automatic water,
but if they were trying to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, be minimalist with it,
I would, I would probably push them in
[SPEAKER_04]: towards a, you know, towards, towards a
90, 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Carl, questions for Brad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben was just mentioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's had great, Ben Polymer,
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's had great success with the mixtures
of no more than 60% turf type tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, he was echoing the need
for high end and establishment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really important for him that
establishment phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg Chorves is challenging you guys,
even you two heavy hitters can't convince
[SPEAKER_03]: me tall fescue on athletic fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing like KBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, the question I want to
ask is I, you know, sometimes we talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about clumpiness of tall fescue and when
we had Chase straw on a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, talking about player safety,
he was talking about how unevenness in the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface can provide safety concerns when
an athlete expects maybe their foot to
[SPEAKER_03]: play it in one way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the turf is clumpy and it goes a
little bit, their foot travels a little
[SPEAKER_03]: farther down, that could present a safety
concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything from you, Brad, on the concern?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think part of the issue with clumpiness,
we could probably spend a whole call on
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it does get back to establishment
where if you don't do a good job
[SPEAKER_04]: establishing tall fescue for the first
time and you get everything from seed
[SPEAKER_04]: washing to insufficient seeding rates and
you just don't have a critical number of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants out there, that right off the bat
is going to lead to clumpiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, with this, actually this
background that the Frank's using,
[SPEAKER_04]: over there kind of on the far side beyond
where we covered, we had some washing and
[SPEAKER_04]: we, you know, it's not part of the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of a border area, but that still
hasn't filled in and that's going back in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, tall fescue, yes,
there's some rhizomatous, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: attributes, but it's basically
functionally, I think it's a bunch type
[SPEAKER_04]: grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like Kentucky bluegrass,
the way Kentucky bluegrass is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: fall in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think some of the clumpiness can be
overcome with, again, seeding rates,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeding timing, making sure you get enough
plants out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the species as an athletic field,
look, I don't think it's for everybody,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I mean, we've got a couple school
districts here in New Jersey, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of south of the New York metro area
that are enormous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these high school, middle school kind
of group complexes, no irrigation,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they've got limited,
you know, labor and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they've got to mow at two, two and a half
inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even have access to water
reels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where, you know, tall fescue is
a good choice given, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the summers that we have,
the warmer climate, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern transition zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that to me, where we're not
talking about real high end sports here,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're talking about middle
school sports and high school sports,
[SPEAKER_04]: practice fields and so forth, where,
you know, I think it makes some sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to say, and I'm going to make
one more shot at it, Greg, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I travel and visit golf courses in the mid
Atlantic and they have embraced tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fescue fully in the rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some beautiful tall fescue in the
rough when you get into the mid Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Brad can attest to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on a sports field, I think I would
always agree with Brad that I'd want
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky bluegrass as a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think having a rhizomatous base on
a sports field is a functional aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: that field that you can't replicate with
any other species that you'd want out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no question about the fact,
I don't want any sports field that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant a cleat in it that doesn't have
some rhizomatous bluegrass in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think tall fescue gives us a wider
latitude of management that I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can juice it up and get what I want and
the density, I think I can cut it lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I don't and I'm a little bit
more light, I think I have some
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think what Brad said about
warmer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue grasses have struggled in the heat
historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ones that are good in the heat,
but they maybe are not as good in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of the season, right,
Brad?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's the argument where
bluegrass might not always be the answer
[SPEAKER_00]: if the shoulders of the season traffic
might be what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think certainly in the spring,
and I think the shoulder seasons are just,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just a challenge across the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's March, it's November,
it's the end of October.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where really, to me,
traffic management becomes important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to, can you saw it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, can you find an avenue to saw it
at some point after November 1 or November
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 and work with administrators to kind of
close a field down?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, look, we're done November 1st
and we're going to saw it between the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: marks, we're going to saw it down the
center.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, we can ryegrass, overseed,
ryegrass, overseed, ryegrass, overseed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But being able to come in and saw it,
that's where bluegrass makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if that's what it could be,
saw it with blue, overseed with rye.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there are situations,
again, where in the absence of irrigation
[SPEAKER_04]: and establishing a field for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I work with a guy that just,
swears by it and doesn't want to touch
[SPEAKER_04]: ryegrass because he's afraid it's not
going to survive the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can't really do a lot of sawing,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why last year when the gray
leaf spot took the tall fescue out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that got very concerning because that's
the kind of thing that changes the game if
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden these low maintenance
areas with higher cut tall fescue are
[SPEAKER_00]: having problems with gray leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very scary thing when Bruce
Clark, half of Bruce Clark's lawn dies
[SPEAKER_00]: because of gray leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets nervous, right Brad?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's an emerging concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be interesting to
see how gray leaf spot and tall fescue
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of affects new plantings versus older
established plantings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, I'm not at least here,
New Jersey and North that we're really
[SPEAKER_04]: know enough about it at this point,
but I mean, it's on the radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the, out of this 2018 tall
fescue test, there is a new, one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: newer variety, there's just a con
commercial and the name actually is kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of marketing itself as a gray leaf spot,
you know, tolerant variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, a new tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a new tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl, more questions or are we
good?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of great comments from,
you know, Ben and Greg and Dan Chippen in
[SPEAKER_03]: there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really happy to have a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's about a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a pretty good,
a pretty good place to end it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad, thanks for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to chat with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you being patient with
my long questions and putting you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: spot, but I don't think we think about
varieties a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it is to be honest,
there's just not a lot of good seeds men
[SPEAKER_00]: left out in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see the seeds men the same
way I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for being that resource for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that everybody there as well
and Rutgers is keeping you safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the opportunity and hey,
you know, anytime we can talk about,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, using data and looking at data
to make, to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's, you know, that's really
what comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're signed off now till we'll see you
again sometime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll let everybody know either
through a shortcut newsletter,
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter or a website.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll post whenever we're ready to do
another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe in a month or so,
but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.
