[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Neil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll thank Neil for being such a great
host.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good to see him again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good to see him thriving here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like spring here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 82 degrees today in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little too warm for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a pleasure to be here,
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also this symposia thing,
Lee Lang and Terence put it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nicknamed the Old Farts Symposium
because it's supposed to be a bunch of us
[SPEAKER_02]: tree crop physiologists who are in the
process retiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're somewhat either already
retired or in the relatively near future
[SPEAKER_02]: retiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get my degree at Davis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was in the botany department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my PhD was in beach and dune plant
ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never did have a formal course in
pomology or horticulture in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'm the primary pomology
instructor at Davis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So life is full of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really enjoyed my career in tree
fruit physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at the pomology as basically
applied environmental physiology with
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I'm going to talk about work
that we've done with root stock physiology
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primarily, I spent a lot of my time doing
crop modeling, tree crop modeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a whole bunch of other sort of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about that on Wednesday of this
week at the Geneva meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought I'd do something a little
different here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about 30 years ago now, Scott Johnson
and myself teamed up with a USDA scientist
[SPEAKER_02]: who had been collecting potentially
dwarfing root stocks for peach,
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Johnson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, he was a graduate from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of Alan Lax's early PhD students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's an extension specialist at
Kearney, at the Kearney Ag Center,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is in the Central Valley of
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and I have done a lot of work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started looking at these root
stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our typical form for these are all
going to talk about peach exclusively
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our standard peach root stock in
California is Nemigard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very vigorous root stock selected
for root knot nematode resistance and
[SPEAKER_02]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our growers are interested in having some
size reduction and less pruning costs and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we began looking at some of these
selections from that program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started out with 122 different
accessions of genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got about 82 of those to root from
hardwood cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, we narrowed it down to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked reasonably good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we finally ended up with these
two, Controller 9 and what are called
[SPEAKER_02]: Controller 9 and Controller 5 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this Hiawatha is an old root stock
from South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they all had some dwarfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the trunk circumferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see there's some dwarfing
after 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the standard open base tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are perpendicular V or a V-shaped
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also end consistently with two
different tops, two different signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trees aren't tremendously smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is Nemigard or Lodell peach on
Nemigard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the one on Controller 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Controller 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: The size of the trees isn't that much
smaller, but the openness of the trees is
[SPEAKER_02]: much greater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have much less response to pruning
when we prune these two as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see here, this is from the
early, again, two different tops and two
[SPEAKER_02]: different training systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And consistently, this is the dry mass of
the dormant prunings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, some are in dormant
prunings that are put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the difference in the
pruning weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequent to that, early study,
Fred Bliss came to Davis and started
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at additional crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Harrow Blood by Okinawa Cross
really threw a lot of variation in
[SPEAKER_02]: size-controlling potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we released four more rootstocks in
addition to the initial two.
[SPEAKER_02]: The initial two are Controller 9 and
Controller 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Controller 5, the tree is actually almost
too small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it produces small fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want dwarf fruit when we have
a dwarf tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these others are all producing
reasonable-sized fruit compared to trees
[SPEAKER_02]: on Nemigard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we released all of these six.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these numbers basically represent
something relative to the size of
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemigard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this should be about 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just slightly reducing 90, 95%,
80%, 70%, 60%, more or less, and 50% of
[SPEAKER_02]: trees on Nemigard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we did all that sort of
evaluation, sorts of work, as a
[SPEAKER_02]: physiologist, I got more and more
interested in the dwarfing mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to talk mainly about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So way back in 1939, looking at Malling 9
and some of the Malling rootstocks,
[SPEAKER_02]: Beak Paine and Thompson, Beak Paine,
they were both at East Malling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They analyzed the anatomy of the xylem and
phloem and so on in dwarfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwarfing apple rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they showed that the xylem
cross-sectional area of the various
[SPEAKER_02]: rootstocks composed of fibers,
phrygium, and vessel rays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the percent of fibers and vessels were
proportional to the vigor of the
[SPEAKER_02]: rootstocks imparted to the scion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more dwarfing rootstocks had
smaller vessels than vigorous rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But well, then they concluded that at
least a partial explanation of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism of rootstock effect may be
obtained from a study of internal
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of the fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very cautious about assigning
any causal relationship between xylem
[SPEAKER_02]: vessel characteristics, the rootstock
versus assigned, to the dwarfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is summarized in
this review, which is an annual review of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant physiology, by Rogers and Beak
Paine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that review, they said that there
were basically three potential mechanisms
[SPEAKER_02]: to explain scion-rootstock interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: May differ greatly in the capacity for
absorbing, storing, and utilizing
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was in transport, focused on the
phloem transport, but acknowledged the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences in size and the numbers of
vessels are sufficient to suggest that the
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity of xylem for water transport
would be higher and vigorous than in dwarf
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this may not be a limiting factor
based on the view that the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: vessels in the stems is normally greatly
in excess of that required to transport
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you know, we have lots and lots of
xylem area in trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they basically said, well,
it doesn't make sense that this can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be a limiting factor,
because in general, we think that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: excess xylem capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the one related to
growth-regulating substances, which
[SPEAKER_02]: basically has been sort of the principal
mechanism that's been bandied around for
[SPEAKER_02]: the last 60 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a graduate student in the 90s,
late 90s, who basically described some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these early rootstocks that we're looking
at and what the growth characteristics
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, the peach rootstocks are
affected or limited shoot length growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was basically the inner node
lengths, but not the number of nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trunk girth was decreased in the
number, as we saw already in the previous
[SPEAKER_02]: slides ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number and length of water
sprouts, the epicormic shoots,
[SPEAKER_02]: tended to be less with the
size-controlling rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a hint that the trees on
dwarfian rootstocks had lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: more negative midday stem water
potentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on that work, that descriptive
work, and on a study that a previous
[SPEAKER_02]: student of mine did, we showed that shoot
extension growth is a linear function of
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperature and the rate of change of
stem water potential in these peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is a little bit
counterintuitive, because before you look
[SPEAKER_02]: at that, so what time of day is shoot
growth the greatest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot extension growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of day is shoot extension growth
the greatest in the fruit tree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early in the morning, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the water potential is the
highest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water potential is the highest,
yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, anybody else want to guess?
Late in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
You got sugar accumulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got sugar accumulation, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so it turns out that,
contrary to the water hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon is the period of most rapid stem
extension growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the extension growth right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that its peak is about 6 o
'clock, 1,800 ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people, because they're so fixated on
water relations, immediately think about
[SPEAKER_02]: the dawn water potential being the driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, temperature is one of the
most significant factors ever driving
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And availability of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lei Leng is focused on carbohydrates,
so that's involved there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we could basically model this
stem extension growth rate as a linear
[SPEAKER_02]: function of the recovery of water
potential from the midday low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rate of recovery of water potential
from the midday low plus the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we got a fairly good regression of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so realizing that or understanding
that, I went back and we thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's take a look at these root stocks
in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this experiment with Nemigard,
Hiawatha, and K146-43, which is controller
[SPEAKER_02]: five now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a range of size reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, we did these diurnal
patterns of extension growth rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: relative extension growth rate,
and stem water potential over the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, most size controlling had
the most negative minimum water potential
[SPEAKER_02]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the spring warmed up, those
differences, especially with the
[SPEAKER_02]: controller five or the K146-43 was much
negative, more negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was as the spring kept going.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as you end up in June,
the differences became a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we put that all together,
we came up with this sort of integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: daily stem fluctuation in megapascals per
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the K146-43 was the most affected or
had the lowest integrated water potential
[SPEAKER_02]: fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Hiawatha in between and
Nemigard here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it convinced us that, yes, indeed,
the water relations thing is something
[SPEAKER_02]: going on with water relations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the water sprout length,
the rapocormic shoot length, in those same
[SPEAKER_02]: trees that we were looking at this other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the accumulated integrated
stem fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, a very good relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: The length of water sprouts, which grow
sort of indeterminately through the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stem water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were now fairly convinced that water
potential had something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had another student,
Luis Solari.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we decided, OK, in order to nail this
down, we should manipulate water
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was, or what he did,
I should say, professors, faculty always
[SPEAKER_02]: say we, but it's really the student that
does all the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevertheless, I'll continue to say we.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what he did was he wrapped the
shoot to stop the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then put this sort of insulating,
like a space blanket material over the
[SPEAKER_02]: top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the shoots didn't heat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he either covered 0%, 30%,
or 60% of the canopy with this material in
[SPEAKER_02]: the evening before a warm summer day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea here was to see whether we
could manipulate water potential and get a
[SPEAKER_02]: range of water potentials and still see
this change in stem extension growth
rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, by doing that, he did that
on the three rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nemigard, Hiawatha, and K146,
or Controller 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see immediately that this is the
stem water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always the more dwarf rootstock had a
lower water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we could indeed raise that water
potential by covering 30% or 60% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that we had basically overlapping
water potentials between the Nemigard and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hiawatha and 146, 43.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the relative stem extension growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get a corresponding overlap in
stem extension growth rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a direct correlation on the
three rootstocks, three different
[SPEAKER_02]: rootstocks directly related to water
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shows the relationship more
clearly as a graph with all the points on
[SPEAKER_02]: it, differing amounts of coverage and so
forth all put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there appears to be a direct
relationship of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when that experiment was done
with those small trees, we used a
[SPEAKER_02]: hydraulic pressure machine to measure
specific hydraulic conductance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, of the shoot part and the root
part, and then put them together,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, what you do is you cut the
tree off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You measure the hydraulic conductance of
the upper part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you turn the thing around and put
it on the root and force the water
[SPEAKER_02]: backwards through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of concern about
whether forcing water backward through the
[SPEAKER_02]: root is the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, you still get these
differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So assuming that the differences would be
relative, you see that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between the treatments with the
scion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these had the same the same
scion on top, same peach scion on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot exactly what it was, but they're
all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're just on different rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rootstock consistently had
nemagard, the root of nemagard had a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher specific hydraulic, leaf specific
hydraulic conductance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the difference was in the
rootstock, not in the scion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this student, that wasn't quite
enough for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this additional experiment where
we put the plants in these chambers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew the plants in the chambers for a
number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a whole slew of other ones that he
did some other experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these chambers, we're able to seal
them up and apply pressure, air pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we moved them to the bottom while
they're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we moved them to a growth chamber and
did this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of work has been done before
with other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of documents that, yes,
water potential actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the system, as we think of it,
actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You apply pressure to the rootstock or to
the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can indeed, as you apply pressure,
the leaf water potential of the scion
[SPEAKER_02]: changes proportionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you apply pressure and the rootstock
water, I mean, the scion water potential
[SPEAKER_02]: increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It maintains the difference between the
two rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, we just had two,
the nemagard versus the controller five or
[SPEAKER_02]: K14643.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more negative one is the
controller five or the dwarfing rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one is the vigorous
rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the relative extension, and this is the
corresponding relative extension growth
[SPEAKER_02]: rate of these rootstocks, I mean,
of the shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we can manipulate the water
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing so, we manipulate the shoot
extension growth rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this sort of nails it in terms of,
yes, indeed, the rate of growth or the
[SPEAKER_02]: rate of stem extension growth on the
rootstock is directly related to water
[SPEAKER_02]: relations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also measured then the hydraulic
conductance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, leaf-specific hydraulic conductance
of these two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the scion, not really,
well, in this case, slightly different,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not a whole lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rootstock is where most of the
difference was between here and here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I had this visiting scientist from
Italy came and he said, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read all your papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be interesting to look at the
xylem anatomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, certainly it can't be that
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole thing can't be that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he went ahead and he measured the
xylem vessel characteristics and then
[SPEAKER_02]: calculated axial hydraulic conductance of
the size-controlled rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, he did Nemigard and the
controller nine and controller five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, he got differences in
the, these are classes of root size
[SPEAKER_02]: categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, so this is now the shoots of
each one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are actually, these were taken
from our foundation plant services block
[SPEAKER_02]: where we have, that's used for
distribution
[SPEAKER_02]: of grafting wood or rooting wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are actual shoots of the
rootstock here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the trunks of the rootstock and
these are the roots of the rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we saw these consistent differences
again in all these parts of having a
[SPEAKER_02]: greater number of large size vessels in
the more vigorous rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a greater proportion of smaller side
vessels in the more dwarfing rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you put all this together and
calculate weighted mean vessel diameters,
[SPEAKER_02]: you see that consistently, well,
fairly consistently at least, the
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemigard, regardless of whether you looked
at the shoots, the trunks or the roots had
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest mean, weighted mean vessel
diameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next one had the intermediate and
the most size controlling had the next
[SPEAKER_02]: most or next smallest vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it did seem to be directly related to
vessel diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does seem to be as simple as just
the anatomy of the rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you calculate the,
he used this, these data in vessel
[SPEAKER_02]: diameters, weighted mean vessel diameters
and so on to calculate the theoretical
[SPEAKER_02]: asylum conductance based on the Pysol law,
which is basically the conductance or the
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance conductance through a vessel or
a pipe is a function of the radius to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fourth power.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, it didn't matter what you
looked at, Nemigard had the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: calculated theoretical conductance and the
others fell in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're fairly certain that we had a
story here, but then we also wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: know whether, how much influence because
there is the notion that the rootstock
[SPEAKER_02]: will influence the anatomy of the cyan or
vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had a tree where we,
well, no wait, this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, so this is the cyan on each of the
rootstocks versus the rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is, and so you see the cyan
was basically identical across when
[SPEAKER_02]: grafted on the three rootstocks,
but the rootstock maintained their
[SPEAKER_02]: differences just like we saw before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the calculated hydraulic
conductance of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, showing that indeed the cyan more
or less stayed the same and it was all in
[SPEAKER_02]: the rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we happened to have some trees
where we would put, where he had put
[SPEAKER_02]: controller nine as an interstem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had O Henry, which is a vigorous
cyan and Nemigard was a vigorous
[SPEAKER_02]: rootstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at the theoretical
hydraulic, we looked at the xylem vessel
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics again, in this combination
with a vigorous rootstock down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom, an interstem here and a vigorous
cyan on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at the theoretical hydraulic
calculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we looked at the, he looked at the
vessel sizes and all that and calculated a
[SPEAKER_02]: weighted mean vessel diameter and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then calculated theoretical hydraulic
conductance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, it came out that
basically the most morphing rootstock when
[SPEAKER_02]: using an interstem had no effect in either
direction on the vessel diameter or vessel
[SPEAKER_02]: anatomy of the rootstock, of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had this series, you notice,
remember I talked about, we had four
[SPEAKER_02]: additional rootstocks that we released.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he looked at the vessel characteristics
of those four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again,
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw that the primary effect was on the
roots and that it was in line with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dwarfing characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also in this case, he looked at
the trunks as well, let me see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we had a, I had a, just last year
I had a geneticist breeder, a peach
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder who was interested in peach
rootstocks come from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, if that's the case,
we should be able to figure out if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna breed rootstocks in the future,
it'd be really interesting if we could use
[SPEAKER_02]: this as a selection tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's gonna have to be simpler than
what Tom Basie did because Tom Basie,
[SPEAKER_02]: he looked at, he did a lot of
calculations, very laborious and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this, so what Claudia Bruckner did
was he looked for some very simple
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics that you could look at
doing cross-section of shoots of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came up with the number of vessels
around the largest vessel over the number
[SPEAKER_02]: of vessels of Nimigard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically he developed a simple
selection criteria by which he felt as a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant breeder, he would, and then he
tested whether he would be able to sort
[SPEAKER_02]: them out or not, depending on if he had a
10% or a 15% or a 20% sort of variance in
[SPEAKER_02]: the selection criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he decided that yes, he could
certainly sort out the more
[SPEAKER_02]: size-controlling roots of rootstocks by
having a quick, a simple assay like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's hopeful that he can actually use
this sort of information in his rootstock
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going back to the beak-bane
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can xylem vessel diameter and
theoretical hydraulic conductance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: outer rings of the xylem, which is what we
measured, be limiting when there appears
[SPEAKER_02]: to be an excess of xylem capacity?
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, why weren't Rogers and
beak-bane correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been troubled by this for actually
quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did, until Basie came back,
we did a short experiment a couple years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the experiment, the experiment was
basically we did girdling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in California, for our peach
production, especially early-maturing
[SPEAKER_02]: peach production, it's actually quite
common that we will, the grower will
[SPEAKER_02]: girdle the trees, which basically means
you take a quarter-inch ring of bark out
[SPEAKER_02]: in the spring, six weeks before harvest,
six weeks before your anticipated harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: you take that ring of bark off there down
to the cambium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that artificial, initially holds
the carbohydrates in the upper part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tree, makes the fruit larger, and it makes
it about three or four or five days
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tree doesn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, contrary to all the stuff about
girdling, the tree doesn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you only do that a quarter-inch,
it grows callus across the girdle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time of harvest, the girdle's
mended again.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tree looks a little sick, but it
recovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do this year after year after
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did that, and we did two times of
girdling, an early girdle and a late
[SPEAKER_02]: girdle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our hypothesis was that, well,
in most girdling, people assume that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: only the transport of sugars that's
affected, not the transport of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we reasoned, well, we're not so sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has been a conundrum in the
girdling literature for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why shoot growth is usually shorter on
girdle trees, while fruit growth is
[SPEAKER_02]: larger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the fruit growth is larger because
more carbohydrates held up in the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why wouldn't that excess carbohydrate
in the tree stimulate shoot growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a problem that's been banging
around in the literature for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this experiment, and then we
looked at midday stem water potentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: After girdling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the early girdle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The midday stem water potential of the
early girdle dropped significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The controls, the triangles here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the late girdle, it dropped also
relative to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of them sort of caught up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the interpretation here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our interpretation is that the girdling
not only affected phloem flow,
[SPEAKER_02]: it affected xylem flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you girdle, you're also
hitting the cambium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're hitting the cambium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to stop the development of
new xylem for that period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So new xylem growth stops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so until it rebounds, you see this
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also recently in the last two
or three, four years, there's mounting
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence that water transport trees and
ring pore xylem with ring pore xylem
[SPEAKER_02]: relies primarily on the most recently
formed ring of xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe two rings of xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this is the number of water sprouts
per tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also affected the number of water
sprouts per tree and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is something published in the
literature way back in 1890 that said that
[SPEAKER_02]: Robinia, if you girdled a Robinia at a
particular time of the year, the tree
[SPEAKER_02]: would die.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did this light girdle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you did it in the spring,
but if you did it in the fall,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was no effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is sort of consistent with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people that are doing the hydraulic
conductance with the probes, they're also
[SPEAKER_02]: finding that if you put the probe too
deep, you can't measure the hydraulic
[SPEAKER_02]: conductance nearly as well as if you keep
it in the outer layers of xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's increasing recognition that it
is the outer layer of xylem that's
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this goes back to the root stock thing,
because if water transport in a plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily dependent on the last year or
the current new growing xylem,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as maybe the last year xylem,
that's going to have an influence on
[SPEAKER_02]: having smaller vessels in the root stock
will have influence on the water potential
[SPEAKER_02]: of those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we have a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, obviously there's some movement in
the previous year xylem, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency of the current year xylem as
it's developing is thought to be much
[SPEAKER_02]: higher than the previous year xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this varies by species
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so a summary of the way we
think about this now is that of how the
[SPEAKER_02]: root stocks of peach root stocks work is
that the diameter of the water conducting
[SPEAKER_02]: vessels of the dwarf root stock are
smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: This causes the hydraulic conductance of
the root stock and the water conducting
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue to be lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This causes the water availability or
water potential in the stems and leaves to
[SPEAKER_02]: be slightly less.
[SPEAKER_02]: This causes the elongation of stems to be
slightly less and overall vigor of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tree is decreased over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is particularly true of the water
sprout parts of the apricormic shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: This decreases the amount of pruning
needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The decreased pruning reduces the number
of water sprouts that are produced in the
[SPEAKER_02]: following year because water sprouts are
produced in response to pruning pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this decreases the need for pruning
even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a cumulative effect of less
pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this decreases the internal canopy
shading and thus increases shoot quality
[SPEAKER_02]: and flower bud development.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't show you data on that,
but typically the bloom on the size
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling root stocks is much heavier
than the bloom on the vigorous root
[SPEAKER_02]: stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, can we simulate this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've done a lot of work with what we
call the L peach model.
[SPEAKER_02]: L stands for Lindenmeyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a particular modeling language.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just show you a movie of the
simulation of the growth of two peach
[SPEAKER_02]: trees, one on a vigorous root stock and
one in which the hydraulic conductance of
[SPEAKER_02]: the root stock only is reduced by 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we can get this to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have here are three identical
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first two years have already been
simulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the initial year in the nursery and the
first year then in the nursery after
[SPEAKER_02]: they're grown in the nursery for a year,
they grow main stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way we grow the trees in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That main stem is then hacked off at knee
high about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you allow shoots to grow out of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the summer, I mean the winter
of the subsequent year, so after the trees
[SPEAKER_02]: are really two years old, one year in the
orchard, we have three types of pruning
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's exactly the same tree simulated in
each case, but there's three different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we call the denuba pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a group of growers, very
conservative growers in the southern San
[SPEAKER_02]: Joaquin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to have all their trees to
really just grow like heck in the second
[SPEAKER_02]: year in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they prune them back to about a
foot stubs or eight inch stubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three scaffolds on an open base tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's the same tree except it's sort
of our standard recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is that you leave these scaffolds
each to be about a meter long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, yeah, anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have what Scott Johnson and
Kevin Day and myself are sort of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: promote is leaving the tree less hard
pruned, selecting some of the fruiting
[SPEAKER_02]: wood off of here and so on, and then
letting them go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a simulation now, a movie of
this subsequent one year's worth of growth
[SPEAKER_02]: in this case with music for your pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I should say what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to explain what the model does.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the model does is basically it grows
the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it's growing, the growth of the
tree is totally dependent on the carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: that's assimilated by the leaves of the
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically simulates the photosynthetic
output of every single leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that carbohydrate is distributed
around the tree according to the sink
[SPEAKER_02]: strength of all the individual organs that
are on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a whole bunch of
submodels in there dictating what
[SPEAKER_02]: individual shoots look like depending on
if they're apicormic or proleptic or what
[SPEAKER_02]: have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll see the differences between
the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two are going to grow a little bit
of fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's blooming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look carefully, you see some green
fruit in here that turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had thin thinning there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those in the front, you may have seen the
fruit, some fruit disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simulating every hour of every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're going to see harvest here
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, I should have stopped it,
but the tree on the left that was really
[SPEAKER_02]: hard pruned ended up to be almost the same
size as the tree in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, and that's because,
yeah, stop there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this tree ended up to be almost the
same size as this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because by hard pruning like
this, we grew almost exclusively apicormic
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots, which have no stop point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apicormic shoots grow differently than,
and this one has some apicormic,
[SPEAKER_02]: these really tall ones are the water
sprouts that came out of these high heads,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's many other shoots in here that
are proleptic shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one, of course, had many,
many more proleptic shoots and still had a
[SPEAKER_02]: few apicormic shoots where we did a
heading cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sort of, it sort of explains how you
can actually, these growers that do this
[SPEAKER_02]: are set on this because they get these
very uniform trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have lots of choices for secondary
scaffolds and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you do these and you have a little
more random structure because you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: forcing as much growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it explains why these guys can be
satisfied with this as compared to the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional system, because by the end of
the season, there's not that much
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the way what happens in
the field as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you might, you would have noticed that
there were more fruit, obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: on these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many of our growers are going to
less and less pruning because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding this more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to go back to the thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get out of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to have to go all the
way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to acknowledge our collaborators
on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been basically 25 years of work off
and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the development of the root
stock, the initial two, Dave Ramming was
[SPEAKER_02]: the USDA researcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: The material came from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Johnson, Kevin Day, and Jim Doyle,
we did all of the field analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then controller 678 and 9.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred Bliss was a faculty member.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ali Al-Medi was a technician of his
that did almost most of the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys also have been helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of the physiology,
initially done by Weibo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had Boris Masili from Italy,
Jordi Marcel from Spain, Luis Solari,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was a student from Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two from Uruguay, and two from Italy,
and one from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the modeling stuff, which I
really just showed you a little bit about,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's been sort of the main
occupation of my mental, whatever mental
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff I have left.
[SPEAKER_02]: David De Silva in the last four years has
been really instrumental in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as Romeo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Romeo Favreau is a really interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's about 86 now, and he was working in
our lab until a year and a half ago on a
[SPEAKER_02]: voluntary basis for about six years,
eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a computer scientist that was at
the input, at the very beginning of
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction of computers into the world,
into commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: He installed the first main frame computer
in Europe back in the 50s, 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these two guys also worked on the
model quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is, when did you exactly
girdle those trees?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned that it's a month,
two weeks, a month before harvest?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, in that case, we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was April, early April,
the second one I think was late April or
[SPEAKER_02]: early May.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's late April.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said it on the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind that our bloom and our spring
is around March 10 for these peach
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: With all that in mind, do you think the
new diamond development provides a
[SPEAKER_05]: significant amount of water to those
plants, let's say two weeks after the
[SPEAKER_05]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know that the initial movement of
sugars up the tree is all in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plumb is non-functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the initial movement of sugar up the
tree in the spring is in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's got to be some functional
xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently that new xylem that's being
developed is more efficient or is,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's our only interpretation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing is, we look at
that water relations thing that we see,
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference in water relations,
it holds up until about the end of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you measure the difference in water
relations between trees on the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: rootstocks and vigorous rootstocks in July
and August, there's no significant
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in the stem water retention,
usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very difficult to detect one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my interpretation now is that the new
ring of xylem is being formed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and because the vessels in that ring are
smaller, that that is actually hindering
[SPEAKER_02]: the hydraulic conductance of that new
shoot growth and the growth of that tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that early part of the season,
when you get adequate new rings of xylem,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you have enough vessels, even though
they're smaller, to match the capacity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the requirement of the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our interpretation at the present
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that been verified anatomically?
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done that, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do that additional thing,
looking at actually the width of the xylem
[SPEAKER_02]: and calculate the total hydraulic capacity
of the total ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did so far was just look at the
new ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that xylem stuff was related to the
new ring, but only one section of the new
[SPEAKER_02]: ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a microscopic field feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: My second question is, since the dwarfing
mechanism in peach is primarily limitation
[SPEAKER_05]: on water transport, do you think with the
same rootstocks, will we see less dwarfing
[SPEAKER_05]: effect in New York versus California?
[SPEAKER_05]: How about it's effect on fruit size,
because water is so important for fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, I think, where we get the
problem with controller five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has small fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Controller five was in the earlier NC 140
trial, the national rootstock trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people in New York really liked it,
because for some reason, it has higher
[SPEAKER_02]: cold tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be related to this vessel size,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fruit in California, it's too
small to be an acceptable rootstock for
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial production in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, controller six is the next step up,
and it's a pair of one by Okinawa.
[SPEAKER_02]: One would think that it would have a fruit
size problem, but for some reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not sure, we don't understand why,
harvest is delayed a week with controller
[SPEAKER_02]: six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that while it may have an
inherently smaller fruit size,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's harvested at the same time,
because you add a week to it, it's able to
[SPEAKER_02]: make up a bit of the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has acceptable fruit size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're quite excited about what that
actually is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two are then getting close
enough to never guard that it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to see a difference in fruit
size.
[SPEAKER_04]: The observation is in the name of Apple,
that if you grab an interstem into a
[SPEAKER_04]: three-part tree, and it's morphing
interstem, the degree of morphing would be
[SPEAKER_04]: proportional to the length of that
interstem.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Apple was involved in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a more complicated story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But LAXO was one of the other people who
reported it, also.
[SPEAKER_02]: LAXO and this student here, early student.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they reported that Malling Nine
had a lower water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trees on, sirens on Malling Nine had a
lower water potential than trees on
[SPEAKER_02]: Seedling or more bigger water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was published years ago already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they sort of left it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think sort of in the same conundrum,
that big bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were all in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Malling Nine is also different in
that you have this lower growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's signs of some sort of flow
incompatibility or something going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is a more complicated
fruit stock situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think water is involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's certainly not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear now and again that California
might be having a drought issue on the
[SPEAKER_00]: news.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just curious, given that
you're conducting hydraulic studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you maybe had any special challenges in
your research or something that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make amends for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was kind of curious about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have to make special things this
particular year because water is on
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's mind and salinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening now is that California
has a very complicated water distribution
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the traditional water districts on
the east side of the San Joaquin Valley in
[SPEAKER_02]: the center of the valley, they all have
these gravity fed irrigation districts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of those will be probably getting
something like 40% to 60% of the normal
[SPEAKER_02]: location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are all local irrigation
districts, more or less local irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: districts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that are on the federal
irrigation or state irrigation projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the California aqueduct, basically
the water on the west side of the San
[SPEAKER_02]: Joaquin Valley and that water continues to
flow into LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that's in the California water
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens with that water is it's
basically water that's pumped out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: delta before the delta runs into the San
Francisco Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water is fresh enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pumped out of that, up the hill,
and then reversed down the valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pumped a couple more times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time it gets too low, pumped up
higher, it gets low.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that water is... Well, most of the
growers on that side are gonna get zero of
[SPEAKER_02]: their allocation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those people are the ones that are
gonna be really hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of that land this year,
the growers, some growers of permanent
[SPEAKER_02]: tree crop also have annual crops,
tomatoes, melons, whatever usually,
[SPEAKER_02]: cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them grow, if they're growing two
types of crop on different pieces of land,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of them will not plant their annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their annual crop and they'll use whatever
water they can find to keep their
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial crop alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll do that largely by pumping the
groundwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem in that area is the
groundwater, depending on where you are,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be very salient or quite salient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now at the moment, everybody is
flipping coins and drawing straws as to
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the lack of water is going to be
the worst thing or whether the salinity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the water is going to be the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for sure, it's all gonna be worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then up north in the Sacramento
Valley, there's also similar sort of water
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution comes out of the Sacramento
River up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rice growers, there's a lot of rice in
California, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this drought state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, we grow a lot of rice in the
Sacramento Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a lot, some of that won't be
planted or people may plant, because those
[SPEAKER_02]: people will probably get 40 to 50% of
their allocation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of that, they'll plant half
their land and use the water from the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole allocation to do the half of the
land, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the price of rice at the moment is
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, previously when we had a
drought, a lot of the price of rice was
[SPEAKER_02]: really low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those guys up there sold their water to
the people down south.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have all these water and main
assistance, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a water market in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year, that probably won't happen
much because agriculture in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: barring the drought, is the most lucrative
that I've ever seen in my 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 35 years of being at the university.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many crops are in high demand with high
prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are
really, the market is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan had a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to point out we got
similar results as you mentioned with
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found was that at the top of the
root stock, the dwarfing stock had a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: water potential, more stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as you went out the branches,
there was a decrease in water potential
[SPEAKER_01]: due to the friction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the slope of that was the same
regardless in the cyan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happened is when you got out to
the end of the branch, you had the same
[SPEAKER_01]: water potentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the dwarfing stock, you got to the
water potential with a one meter long
[SPEAKER_01]: branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the more vigorous one,
you started with a higher water potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took two meters of growth to get to
that same water potential where it
[SPEAKER_01]: stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the outside of the trees all ended up
with the same water potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it varied with the root stock at the
center of the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't looked at that down the shoot
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that with you and Bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bill O'Lean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill O'Lean, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't remembered that part of the
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you publish that part of the study?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
I'll look for it.
That's OK.
I usually just skim the papers for the
part that I want to hear anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if you have any other questions,
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you tonight, Alan.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
