[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our lab tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sitting here in my office in the
Plant Science Building at Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: University, opposite Mr. Jensen Jaggi,
our brilliant and accomplished filmmaker
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's going to take us on a whirlwind
kaleidoscopic tour of our facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to mention now a few of
the sites that Jensen, who's a member of
[SPEAKER_01]: our lab, is going to take you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jensen's going to show but a few scenes
and a few other people from the lab will
[SPEAKER_01]: make appearances in some of these
different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in Plant Science, I hope you're
going to see a couple of our pea
[SPEAKER_01]: collection points at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're also going to see our
laboratory in a different building.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to also see our kind of wet
lab where we do our pea work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a pasteurizer from the Rich Earth
Institute there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our ABC tanks, and it's right near
our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it connects with our setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And analysis work and our greenhouse work
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also be visiting Dillman Hill
Student Organic Farm, where some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments take place in the high tunnel
and out in the Saxon racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see our little garden there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll also be making a quick
visit to the Soto Factory, where we have
[SPEAKER_01]: community engagement and even a few scenes
from our work in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just real quick to acknowledge a couple
of our collaborators, Professor Johannes
[SPEAKER_01]: Lehmann is a biochar expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a key conspirator for some of our
resource recovery work involving biochars.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's involved in our project also on
pea-powered composting and grow-as-you-go
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening, also in East Africa,
where our lead collaborator is Professor
[SPEAKER_01]: Charles Minega, another world famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a biologist, entomologist,
public health guy, and all around circular
[SPEAKER_01]: economist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, just want to take my hat to
them and many other collaborators who are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pea cycling that we're involved with
is entirely container-based sanitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the urine collected from all the
sites and all the collection schemes is
[SPEAKER_02]: collected in containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Nelson transports the containers to
this site here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a tank just outside this window
that we receive urine from the various
[SPEAKER_02]: places we collect it, dump it in there,
and it's pumped into the pasteurizer from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Richter Earth Institute and returned
to another tank that we can draw down and
[SPEAKER_02]: use in experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: As with any area of agricultural
innovation, we have a lot to benefit from
[SPEAKER_02]: working with partners who are engaged in
either exploring the same questions but
[SPEAKER_02]: different contexts or exploring different
but related questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Nelson Lab collaborates with many,
many collaborators on Cornell's campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell's university slogan is any person,
any study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are people across the university
pursuing different areas of study,
[SPEAKER_02]: but who share an interest in circularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are collaborators all across
campus in other disciplines within the
[SPEAKER_02]: School of Agriculture and outside that
school that we collaborate with.
[SPEAKER_02]: On campus, one of our most important
collaborators is the student farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell has a network of agricultural
experiment stations, farms where
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers host research, host
experiments, extension activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the sites closest to Cornell's
academic campus is the student farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is right on the campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a site that hosts student-led
research, including students who see in
[SPEAKER_02]: this video here who lead research projects
with the Nelson Lab based at the student
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this summer I've been working here on
the Dillman Hill Student Organic Farm and
[SPEAKER_03]: also a bit inside the lab where we're
taking a look at how our organic
[SPEAKER_03]: underutilized resource substrate and a
variety of alternative organic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_03]: such as urine and fish effluent are
affecting the health and growth of two
[SPEAKER_03]: culturally significant indigenous crops,
which are Haudenosaunee skunk beans and
[SPEAKER_03]: Cherokee tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also is a place where students can work
as farm managers and be hired into that
[SPEAKER_02]: role when they learn how to manage a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also lead a number of community
engagement initiatives that bring really
[SPEAKER_02]: substantial amounts of the student body
onto the farm to engage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pea cycling efforts that the
Nelson Lab leads there, the pea
[SPEAKER_02]: collection, the eco-loo collecting toilet,
as well as our experiments in the high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel there, are featured really
prominently and students are exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through that facility, we are studying
different aspects of the circular bio
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, we're up at Dillman
Hill Student Organic Farm in our high
[SPEAKER_04]: tunnel working with some tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also interested in looking at
alternatives to conventional nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this case, we've grown some of our
tomatoes with miracle oil, a standard
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizer used by men.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many gardeners, but we've also grown some
plants with pasteurized human urine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're here at Dillman Hill Student
Organic Farm at the pollinator garden that
[SPEAKER_05]: is a pea powered pollinator garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful bees all around me with these
beautiful flowers that are growing because
[SPEAKER_05]: of peas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in this vicinity is an indigenous
research project using culturally relevant
[SPEAKER_05]: crops that are also fertilized with pea as
well as black soldier fly frass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And comparing that against conventional
miracle grove where we made this
[SPEAKER_06]: indigenous Pan-American garden as a model
for marginalized areas where their soils
[SPEAKER_06]: may be contaminated or depleted by
nutrients from synthetic fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticide peels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil factory is an off campus site
with a big warehouse and a lot of space
[SPEAKER_01]: and an artist residency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where a group of us,
a key co-conspirator again being Johannes
[SPEAKER_01]: Lehmann and many others, we have art
science events where artists come visit
[SPEAKER_01]: and put on shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have pea cycling toilets being invented
there and we have a big grow as you go
[SPEAKER_01]: garden where we're doing pea powered
composting and gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people come from abroad,
for instance, I also mentioned Charles
[SPEAKER_01]: Medega, when he and other people come to
talk about whatever circular economy
[SPEAKER_01]: topic, they'd always have a community
event there with a dinner and people,
[SPEAKER_01]: an informal exposure to the community and
exchanging ideas with people from around
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nice place for all sorts of
exchange of information and pea cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: gets a whole lot of press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Rebecca Nelson lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll guide you through our lab facilities
and showcase some key areas and equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: that support our research activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the work benches where we
conduct most of our hands on experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each bench is equipped with standard tools
and equipment such as microscopes for
[SPEAKER_00]: observing microorganisms, pH and
conductivity meters for monitoring the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: and salinity of samples, as well as the
centrifuge for separating different
[SPEAKER_00]: components of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above the work benches are shelves with
mostly regents, glassware and items we use
[SPEAKER_00]: for chemical and biological analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have refrigerators and freezers
that we use for storing and preserving
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a fume hood and biosafety
cabinet that we use for experiments that
[SPEAKER_00]: involve volatile chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Agricultural College, we
collaborate with Johannes Lehmann and his
[SPEAKER_02]: research group on the uses of biochar in
these systems and other questions as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Internationally, Dr. Nelson has colleagues
around the world, but especially in Kenya,
[SPEAKER_02]: is our closest collaborator, Dr. Charles
Medega at Poverty and Health Integrating
[SPEAKER_02]: Solutions, where he focuses on different
uses for urine in agriculture there,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially targeting the area urban and
urban applications, uses of urine in
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar, and is really intimately engaged
with a number of community-based
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations there, both for the pee
cycling side of the work and for the
[SPEAKER_02]: community engagement and extension aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to all the facilities that
facilitate our ability to study the use of
[SPEAKER_02]: urine as fertilizer and to provide
nutrients in these novel horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: media, really the secret sauce to our work
and how we can study what we study here is
[SPEAKER_02]: not the facilities, but the colleagues we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of my teammates and the team that
Rebecca, that Dr. Nelson leads,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we all feel really lucky to work
with each other, and that is really what
[SPEAKER_02]: the Nelson lab brings to the table.
Thank you.
Thank you.
