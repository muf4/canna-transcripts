[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, my talk, first, I want to thank
Brian for his kind introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has always been a great pleasure for me
to work in this lab since I was undergrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that will convey to you
through my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, we're going to talk about
utility regulation in this pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I want to touch on is
to show you a little bit about this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you have a picture of our
rod-shaped pseudomonas cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a reginosa cell, unfortunately,
not a syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the highest resolution I can
find on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that we have a rod-shaped
cell with polar flagella, which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our species, Pseudomonas syringae is a
plant, a pathogenic bacteria that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide host range because there's over 60
total passivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model strand we're interested in is DC
3000, which is a tomato pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can also affect Arabdopsis as well as
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain has been developed as a model
strand, largely thanks to people in this
[SPEAKER_00]: department on this very campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people like Alan Comer and Greg
Martin we know a lot and a lot about their
[SPEAKER_00]: type III secretion system and the
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I'm going to talk about not the
virulence part of it, but the motility
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got into this because when I joined
the lab back in 2017, Swingle Lab has
[SPEAKER_00]: already been working on motility for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result at the time when I
joined the lab, where you have Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: DC 3000 use this motility to evade plant
immunity, especially the part of PTI,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where the plant are detecting
flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without going too much into the detail
about this model, which concerns a chapter
[SPEAKER_00]: of my thesis that I won't be present here
today, but will probably come up in my B
[SPEAKER_00]: exam, I just want to say that at the time
we already know a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: motility control in DC 3000 has this
ecological function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what motility are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are total five different types of
motility that are present in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're mostly concerned about swimming
motility in this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several features of swimming motility
I'd like to point out is one, it requires
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria to be inside of a certain
liquid or semi-liquid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, it needs this flagellum, it needs
flagellum as the main organ, if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, or as a main structure it relies on
to facilitate the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three, it is consuming energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flagellum rotation relies on proton
motor force to power itself, to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: the torque and pull the bacteria forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, motility in bacteria in general has
been topic of study for past half century
[SPEAKER_00]: or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most well-known model of motility
regulation in all of bacteria is
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotaxis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an algorithm building the
bacteria, if you would say, that follows a
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always wants to improve the chemical
environment for the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'm showing you that if you put a
hypothetical scenario where you have from
[SPEAKER_00]: cold color to warm color, the
concentration of, say, a nutrient or some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of chemical the bacteria really
likes, and you have our polar flagellum
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, such as zoonomas, moving or
swimming inside this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you would observe in any case
would be kind of a run and tumble model,
[SPEAKER_00]: which describes the movement and the
sudden break and then the disassociation
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the polar flagellum and then
reorientation at a random angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also described as a bias random
walk because the randomness of the break,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also it's biased towards in such a way
that when it's going above or when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing the gradient of the nutrient or
the chemical it actually likes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a lower probability of stop and
reorient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biased random walk well ended up
help the bacteria move to a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of the chemical that it
actually likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So zoonomas is a well annotated strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the first fully sequenced
plant pathogenic bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to that, we can fully transfer the
knowledge we know on E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and all other bacteria about this
chemotaxis regulation into this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a very complicated system and
I won't go into much detail about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all I want to show here is that we
know what these genes are in our genome
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can find them by any kind of like
screening we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's touch a little bit on what
motility can do in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most basic function of motility in any
bacteria is try to get to different
[SPEAKER_00]: location where there are nutrients
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like the two sides of the
same coin that you can also kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: away from your claw mates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a group of the same identical
strands, you are evading competition with
[SPEAKER_00]: your king.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way your group in general or
overall will have a higher efficiency at
[SPEAKER_00]: uptaking nutrients into your organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help with reproduction and so on or
other important functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I elude to a little bit earlier,
our group has been working on the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: using its motility to evade plant
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other motility, what other
functions can motility achieve in a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in our example, the plant,
these are cells that get into plant
[SPEAKER_00]: apoplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the challenge is facing there is that
the PTI is detecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PTI is detecting using flagellating
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that adaptation, as our lab has
previously found, is that it can use LGU
[SPEAKER_00]: to downregulate motility as well as
flagella synthesis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply the same logic to other
locations where the plant pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria can land on, such as leaf surface
before they enter the apoplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Lindow's group in UC Berkeley has
previously found that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges plant pathogenic bacteria can
face on top of leaf surface includes it
[SPEAKER_00]: has very unevenly distributed nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, if you're ever taken a
30-10 or 40-10, you know that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: also very limited entrance into apoplasts
for any bacterial pathogen of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could potentially be mitigated by
chemotaxis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been literature showing that
bacteria can use some kind of organic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: as a signal they're tracking to find those
natural openings and wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but there are also other known
challenges that are present on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, such as the extra environmental
hazard from the sun, the UV lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also Steve Lindow's group has also
shown that there's very high osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that haven't been
discussed a lot in the literature is on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of plant surface, you can have the
competition with the epiphyte microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't yet know a whole lot about
what the bacteria is doing to deal with or
[SPEAKER_00]: to cope with those challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a small spoiler, I think we have
found some evidence in our screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later I will show you the data that
they might have some mechanism already in
[SPEAKER_00]: place for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, I'd like to also
introduce to you to the idea that desis
[SPEAKER_00]: resultant is a social bacteria in that it
engages in social behavior, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: cell-cell communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm showing you that it does harbor a
typical chromosome system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the bacteria is most famously
known to interact with its own species as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as some other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can co-coordinate expression of
genes and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And desis resultant also engage in
production of public goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as surfactant and siderophore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you are seeing the typical or the
most famous yellow pigment pyoveridin in
[SPEAKER_00]: our strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all that, I'd like to present a
question I'd like to discuss today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, what ecological functions can
desis resultant achieve with its motility
[SPEAKER_00]: control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we already kind of know it can
do a little bit of dealing with the host,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe help with its virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to present the
first two chapters of my thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first project I want to get into is a
TN-seq-based screen of novel swimming
[SPEAKER_00]: motility genes in desis resultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a collaborative project between
our lab and the Philadelphia lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly with Dr. Tyler Hellman,
who joined us a couple of years back as a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time, we already know that we
want to find novel motility regulators in
[SPEAKER_00]: desis resultant because the LGU,
we have done a couple screenings with the
[SPEAKER_00]: LGU project and with various success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tyler at the time joined us with a
very powerful tool that is TN-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly is TN-seq?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, TN-seq in its essentiality is asking
the same questions over and over again
[SPEAKER_00]: across a genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, if a strain has a point mutation
introduced by transposon insertion,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a given locus in the genome,
does that strain grow better or worse
[SPEAKER_00]: under any type of environmental selection
you impose or not impose?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine that we have two
strands here, each represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those black dashes represent their
relative abundance or how many copies they
[SPEAKER_00]: are in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first strand we have here has an
insertion on the tip of gene A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second strand we're talking about
here has an insertion that at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can do here is you can pull
this library population, pull them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let them go through some kind of
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they grow, you can sample the
posterior or the after selection
[SPEAKER_00]: population and then count the relative
abundance of the copies of each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, you can see that gene A,
in this hypothetical scenario,
[SPEAKER_00]: its abundance decreased after the
selection, whereas gene B remained more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, we can say, oh,
gene A, the loss of function in gene A is
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing the growth of that strand under
our selection criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we can scale it up and make
it a full screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just one strand per gene,
you can have multiple now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for each one of those strands,
you can calculate the relative abundance
[SPEAKER_00]: of the before and after our selection in
the respective populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all of those strand fineness or
the strand relative abundance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can calculate the gene average
fineness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be a ratio that is either
below 1, equal to 1, or above 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps us to establish a link
between a growth genotype to a gene's
[SPEAKER_00]: function to a gene's contribution to a
selected function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this selection is totally arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can manipulate it as we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to come to us with this method,
as well as a library that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: generated by Dr. Jennifer Louise in UC
Berkeley, which has been mapped but
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't, unfortunately, been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another note here is that in the data
I will present to you in the following
[SPEAKER_00]: slides, those ratios will be converted by
log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that's below 1 will now be
negative, and everything above 1 will be
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have this powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to figure out is how do we
link that to motility, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially interested in motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motility contributing genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the time when I joined the lab,
this method of using soft obverse swimming
[SPEAKER_00]: media to quantify the swimming phenotype
is already long established in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's a standard method in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do here is you just inoculate
your bacterial strand in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% auger plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm showing you a minimal
medium that is MOBS-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you let it grow, or this is resolved
in this particular media recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really takes 48 hours for you to get to
the size of a decent measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're dealing with some kind of
mutant that does not actually move or
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow have impaired motility,
the colony simply does not expand from the
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the logic of this assay is that low
motility strands cannot move far from the
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we incorporate that and the
TN-seq method to make a screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the most easiest thing to do is just
brute force and fuse them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we started doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the library culture,
and we make an inoculum from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take the time zero sample,
as you do in all TN-seq experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just inoculate and let the swimming
assay go with a library.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a single strand,
but a pool of bacterial strands that each
[SPEAKER_00]: has a single mutation somewhere in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sample everything that's in the red
circle, which is a whole colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use that as our samples to repeat
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, we also keep a
sample for DNA extraction and BAR-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that, you can see that the selection
we're imposing here is not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the growth in the media recipe
we provide them, as well as the swimming
[SPEAKER_00]: auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the expected hits we are looking for
here is that we're looking for nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions, because this is a minimal
medium, and also metabolism genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help them going through those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also thinking, because this is a
nutrient-limiting environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: so motility will help in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not sure how many of those we
will find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just roll with this and set up a
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, what we found is we
actually hit quite a lot of motility
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm showing you the four tiers of
flagellum motility regulation that is
[SPEAKER_00]: present in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm transplanting that here in DC3000
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see some of them are in
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that are missing
homologs in our strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones in gray are the ones we didn't
find in our mutant library at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red ones are the ones that we
found across the seven replicates we did
[SPEAKER_00]: with seven total passages we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any point of time, they have a
significant penalty for loss of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means those strands, if the
bacteria has a loss of function in any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those genes, they're not growing,
or we're not getting them from the final
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black means exactly opposite of that,
meaning that they are always being
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a total of 34 out of 47 of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, we're still facing the problem
that we need to distinguish them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient restriction genes and metabolism
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to counter that, after a long time of
trying to figure out what to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with this scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's intuitive, at least,
is that if we add another layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, what if now I select against
motility?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the environment itself is selecting for
motility and I then add an arbitrary
[SPEAKER_00]: selection against motility, doesn't that
mean only the motility genes will respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to this selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still growing in the same
nutrient condition and all, so if those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are having high finish, phenotypes,
they should be present in both groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is a difference between those
two selection schemes, those should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: response I detect from just the motility
contributing genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went with this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we expect is,
well, now we're selecting against
[SPEAKER_00]: motility, so the motility should decrease
on population level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And voila, they did, which is pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we then look into how the finish
for genes are behaving across these
[SPEAKER_00]: passages, we found a very clear split,
that when we're selecting for everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: the population kind of evolved this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're selecting just for the
non-motile population in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plate, the population evolved in a very
different trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we're hitting something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look into the highest finish values
or finish phenotypes we have in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these lists of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found three groups of them that are
behaving very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first group, represented by the
chemotaxis genes, QB and QY, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: known chemotaxis motility contributors,
they have a finish that is lower when the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole population is passing, when the
plate itself is selecting for motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we then added the extra layer of
selection, they reversed back their finish
[SPEAKER_00]: to be positive, meaning now losing those
genes are not as bad for the strands once
[SPEAKER_00]: we select for low motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second group represented by
flagellular motor genes, MOTA and MOTB,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their response is flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is still a mystery to us why they
will do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third group of genes,
which I think most of this audience will
[SPEAKER_00]: be interested in, is why we hit
hypothorese equation genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are active, and they are having a
positive finish scores in either cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that they're on in the minimal
medium situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But MOB's minimal medium is not the
euro-hard minimal medium pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very curious why they're actually
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't broadly do anything to
motility, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those three groups, when we plot out
every gene and their responses across all
[SPEAKER_00]: our passages, you can see a very clear
split of these three groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we have so many more questions
about the second and the third group of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, we ended up focusing on the
chemotaxis genes because we know what
[SPEAKER_00]: their phenotypes should look like once we
go into individual mutational study of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three other members of this group
are PSPD-046, which is a cycloid IGMP
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this links it to motility in its nature
just by what we know about cycloid IGMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that, well, indeed,
you have a phenotype where you knock it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and it impairs motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you complement it back,
the motility comes back a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: not fully, but partially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this is an overexpression instead of
its natural promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1042 is another interesting one because
this is an anti-signal factor for
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidative stress that has been shown by
the previous member of a social lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has not really been linked to
motility or confirmed to link to motility
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found it has a very clean impaired
motility by knockout, and overexpression
[SPEAKER_00]: completely restored the motility phenotype
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's telling us that there are
linkage between stress response and
[SPEAKER_00]: motility control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ecology of it, we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the oddball of them all,
the hypothetical protein PSPTO-4029.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely stunning result in that
knocking it out does not really do that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slightly impairs motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we overexpressed it, it abolishes
motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we get sidetracked into go
full in on 4229.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a hypothetical protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of them are, they're small
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a total amino acid 273.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only annotation on the protein is HDOD
domain from 23 to 210, which does not tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you really anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: HDOD domain is such a general term that
incorporates all kinds of functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really contain much
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm showing you kind of a model here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried a whole bunch of methods
trying to figure out what this protein is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that ended up working for us is
aeroprom PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is we generate another library.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a lot of library generation
within one talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generate a library of sequence each
with few single point mutations by
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroprom PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is you're trying to use a
different polymerase and so on,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get an aero sequence happening
during PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we fuse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put all of them into our expression
constructs and ask them to perform on
[SPEAKER_00]: swimming media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens there is because we know
the wild type, 4229 overexpressed
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, is complete abolishment of
motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to screen for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up getting 4229.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 40 different plasmids that are
having failed to suppress motility
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm showing all the sequence we
got, amino acid sequence we got that are
[SPEAKER_00]: still fall-ins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to diverge for concentration
into the conservation plot here in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are where we found among those
fall-in sequences that are having
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations from the wild type which is on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we use this tool called Scanit
which can predict protein-protein
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction by just inputting amino acid
sequence that is recently developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives us a prediction on each
amino acid residual how likely they are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in protein-protein interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we indeed find the highest predicted
interacting site is kind of like aligning
[SPEAKER_00]: with a hotspot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went in and we did the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We replaced those two arginines that are
being flagged out with alinings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the phenotype is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know there is an important residual
for this suppression phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ecology of it, again, no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have to tell you so far for just
one of those for the first project is that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, TN-seq is, again, very powerful as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Laurie told you a couple weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you can select a function,
this is a tool that can get you most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes you're interested in or give you
great candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, swimming motility in disease
development can be co-regulated by stress
[SPEAKER_00]: response with no previously known
connections to motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortu29 has a dominant suppression
phenotype on motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's swimming, but as an additional note,
it's also swarming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show the phenotype here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, because we know nothing about
the ecological significance of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a lot more study to do if we want
to follow up on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this has piqued some of your
interest in motility, because the next
[SPEAKER_00]: story is going to be a little bit more
wild than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing, I don't know how much it's
showing here, but I'm showing you a very
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdly shaped disease-resistant colony
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we found almost
coincidentally or by accident back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a socially induced
disease-resistant swimming motility we
[SPEAKER_00]: call baited expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back when I joined the lab,
Brian and Kern was interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put two colonies of the same
species, bacteria, onto swimming media,
[SPEAKER_00]: they somehow form this gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they behave slightly different than
they were if they are growing alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the job to replicate this
phenotype a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing that, we also incorporate the
inter-species interactions as sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a second control for these phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in doing that, what I realized is
Slumans are doing something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Slumans is paired against Dekia on
third day, or paired with E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli or Xanthomonas on fifth day,
you start to see the colonies are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something on these edges that are closer
to the interaction partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're doing,
but I want to study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to standardize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is these colonies are not
really standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is on day three, this one day
five, day five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need a way to bring them to a more
comparable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my solution, because the strands were
using our model strands and our strands
[SPEAKER_00]: with more genetic resource wisdom,
I was able to get non-motor mutants of
[SPEAKER_00]: them and standardize this phenotype to
such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that when you have an
unbated control of these results,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's more regular, it's radial,
and it's symmetric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you have a E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli bait here, it starts to behave
non-symmetric, the same with Dekia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you put another DC3,000 as its
interacting partner here, it's back to
[SPEAKER_00]: being radial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a standardized phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can start to quantify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we quantify is how much
growth they are having on each side,
[SPEAKER_00]: or how much of the bacteria colony is
expanding on each direction regarding the
[SPEAKER_00]: position of the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see the blue lines here
represents the proximal, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: proximal to the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red is the distal, because it's
away from the bait, from the both stars at
[SPEAKER_00]: the inoculation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quantification of that is laying
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that with E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli or Dekia as a bait, the overall
colony expansion is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within the two sides of the colony,
the proximal especially is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is induced by the presence of the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recently come up with this,
actually, is to trace the colony edges and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just overlay them to show that there
is a significant difference in how the
[SPEAKER_00]: colony morphology is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see that even with control
plasmids, so they're growing slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: slower than the previously shown,
you still have the extra growth or
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion on the side that is close to the
bait, proximal to the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question I had for this was,
is this chemotaxis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this looks very much like
chemotaxis to me for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's directional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotaxis is always directional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, we observed in many of our
replicates that if the closer location of
[SPEAKER_00]: a single bacteria is located, or of a
colony, this is a resultant colony,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a bait, you seem to get stronger
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are chemotaxis-like features of
what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our collection of chemotaxis
mutants are usually non-motile,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you just don't get motility,
and you can't really use them to test
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they are behind this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing we could do was to test
for inducibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of that test is if you have a
chemotaxis like behavior where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking some kind of accumulable chemical
signals, or depletion of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just let the depletion or
accumulation happen for longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that should provoke even stronger
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pilot I'm showing with Arrhenia
amalobora EA273 as the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this bait here has
been inoculated 24 hours before the
[SPEAKER_00]: DC3,000 colony is inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, you have a bait that's the
same species of Arrhenia that's inoculated
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time point as your DC3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a very clear behavior
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has stronger behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also replicate that with the
tracing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, it still provokes a very different
colony morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, it's more lateral
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more on the sides of the colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, our conclusion here is that
it is something that's accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either accumulating of a signal or
depletion of a signal, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulable in its nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we did here is we're
interested in what is the driving force
[SPEAKER_00]: for this behavior to manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, we have two hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be either growth difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this part is growing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it is a major motility difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to test that, what I ended up doing is
I ended up cutting the plate in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that separates the whole plate into two
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is proximal to the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is distal to the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious whether those two parts of
the colony are actually having similar
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of viable cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, when a colony is baited,
the proximal side is having more viable
[SPEAKER_00]: cells than the distal side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when it's just a normal colony
growing on its own, that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to our biggest surprise here is that
we couldn't detect the immediate finish
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit of doing the behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the total viable cells in the
colony is not significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pushed us more leaning towards
this is a motility phenotype rather than a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we recently, with the help of the new
fancy microscope we got, we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at that more closely under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'm showing you on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this panel, the bait is towards the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top, I'm showing you the sampling,
a field of view that's fixed coordinate on
[SPEAKER_00]: the proximal edge of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom, it's on the distal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that on the proximal,
you have a... So the DC 3000 here is
[SPEAKER_00]: tagged with GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the proximal edge,
you have faster growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity changes over the 90 minutes
course a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas on the bottom, there's not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you can see the movement of the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a little bit hard to see on
this resolution, but the first white line
[SPEAKER_00]: is where I marked the initial edge at the
beginning of 48 hours post-inoculation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this line here is where I could,
on a higher resolution, find the edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: this colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is for the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short of the story is over 90
minutes of observation, the proximal edge
[SPEAKER_00]: moved about 600 microns, whereas the
distal edge moved only less than 200
[SPEAKER_00]: microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that there is a movement
difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since we're seeing that much
difference in behavior of those two edges,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're now interested in if we can find any
genetic markers for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the approach we took here is we want to
sample those edge populations and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find a transcriptomic difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm showing you exactly where we
sampled on each plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the most distal edge or the most
proximal edge to abate within our
[SPEAKER_00]: DC-terrizontal colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we run RNA-seq with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, what we found
is the proximal edges that are most close
[SPEAKER_00]: to a E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli bait and the proximal edge that's
most close to a D-kia bait are behaving
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very differently than all the other
edges we were able to sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those edges kind of mix together,
which is more clear on this PCA plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the D-kia in blue and E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli in this red eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went into the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we found something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to use a list of
differentially regulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest full change we found was with
this hypothetical gene and another
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetical gene, PSPTO5639.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have any information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the very close neighborhood,
we also find this more aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to confirm both of them
are indeed induced in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the proximal population towards abate
by QRTPCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that do?
[SPEAKER_00]: MOA-A is annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know from its annotation that in
cosmolibinum cofactor biosynthesis protein
[SPEAKER_00]: A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a GTPase for what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: MOCO is a highly conserved function across
bacterial species and also across
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humans and plants have molybdenum
cofactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're involved in redox enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, those are involved in global
sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, MOA-A was the only hit among
all the RNA-Z data we have within this
[SPEAKER_00]: MOCO function, within all the genes that
are linked to molybdenum cofactor
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, but we're geneticists.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We knock it out and find out that it
somehow mitigates or eliminates the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you put it back, you have the
extra growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the tiny wild type control
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add it back by overexpression,
that extra growth comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: MOA-A is our guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it the GTPase part, or is it the
MOCO part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because GTPase interacts with GTP that
also can potentially interact with cyclic
[SPEAKER_00]: digem B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really curious which approach did
it take to actually influence fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: and, in this case, our behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look into what's in the MOCO
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a MOCO biosynthesis genes in
E.
coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we picked another essential gene for
this biosynthesis function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked the MOA-A, which is the last in
the step of MOCO assembly, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: inserts the molybdenum actually to the
cofactor complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did the genetic thing again by
knocking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we were able to see this
phenotype or this behavior disappeared
[SPEAKER_00]: when we knock it out and come back when we
overexpressed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know MOCO is our guy instead of
just MOA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have told you so far is that,
in this chapter, is that swimming motility
[SPEAKER_00]: is socially inducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the behavior we call beta expansion is
tracking some kind of accumulable signals,
[SPEAKER_00]: be it the actual accumulation or
depletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that beta expansion results
more from motility rather than growth from
motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our extraction or viable cell counting
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, MOCO contributes
to the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be essential to the whole
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we enter the wild speculation
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just me, or does this look like a
charge to you, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this looks very aggressive to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't yet know that much about this
ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have speculations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our speculations is that this
is a competition behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to get closer for either
territorial range or get into a closer
[SPEAKER_00]: position to initiate one of the cell-cell
interaction mechanisms, such as type 6
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion or actual cell killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no information of those genes
being upregulated in our RNA-seq data at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, not type 6, not any like toxin
production or any thing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot rule out once they get
there, they might do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been looking at this and think of
this for the last six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still haven't cracked it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a summary, I hope those materials
have picture interest in motility in our
[SPEAKER_00]: very closely studied DC 3000 bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that helps you appreciate that
motility regulations can respond to social
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions as well as environmental
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a lot more ecology to be
studied in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'd like to thank the past and
current Steve Swingle lab members,
[SPEAKER_00]: our collaborators Dr. Jen Lewis,
Dr. Tyler Hellman, boys in the audience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Cornell T.
[SPEAKER_00]: rex and BRC that helps us with a lot of
the sequencing stuff we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to also thank my committee
members and everyone that's interacting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the office daily, as well as the amazing
postdoc and graduate student body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to make one more comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of friends who told me I'm
the happiest graduate student they ever
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's largely because I'm in
this amazing community and I work in an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to have my birds
take questions from me, but I will speak
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any questions for Igor?
Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the second part of the talk,
bacterial baiting and such, the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that's swarming towards or charging as you
put it, can you keep those bacteria?
[SPEAKER_02]: And or if you mix them together or
co-inoculate at the same time or put them
[SPEAKER_02]: really close to each other, does the
pseudomonas kill the E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli or whatever else is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have done some asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, if we just
co-inoculate the two bacteria together,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there evidence of killing happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been able to observe any like
killing with like stands and stuff yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to see suppression,
but if we co-inoculate in liquid culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that could also just be nutrient
competition instead of active killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of evidence on or we
have very few evidence on that actual
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin production or anything is involved
in these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main hypothesis right now is that
it's a competition behavior, but it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of exploitive competition where
it's just trying to grab more nutrient for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lori.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a question about your TNC data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you pulled out these like type 3
secretion signals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think since this is like,
I guess a social interaction, like do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think there's a possibility of like
another way that you could look for things
[SPEAKER_03]: that might be signals that are going
between cells?
[SPEAKER_03]: Presumably those would not come out of a
TNC because they need like sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, is there some other way you
could look for like what those type 3
[SPEAKER_03]: secretion signals are, like what they're
signaling or what they're sensing or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, is there alternative
methods to screen for or look for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: signal that is being transferred in
between the bait and the decision colony?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lab has done something before trying
to go like mass spec and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really get anywhere with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one of the, so that happened
when I was still undergrad, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another undergrad at the time,
Mikhail, who was working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember the comment he made was
there's so much processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he was trying to do was trying to
extract the gel in between the colonies
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to figure out if we can find
something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the comment back then was they
were super processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are so many layers of
processing that he was pretty negative
[SPEAKER_00]: about like potentially finding anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we ended up finding.
[SPEAKER_03]: The secretion genes you found,
do they, is there anything known about
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're transporting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that helps get at that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: The secretion genes I found, are there any
information about what they could be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the social motility, so MOA is not
a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: So molybdenum cofactor in general are not,
well, I think all of them are not
[SPEAKER_00]: secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are cytoplasmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't, that actually didn't point
out to any directions that leads to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential secreted signal into the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm talking about the hits from
your TMZ screen, your technical secretion
[SPEAKER_03]: hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that actually does not involve,
does not relate to the motility,
[SPEAKER_00]: so social motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam's question is, did we confirm the
type III secretion genes were active in
[SPEAKER_00]: the MOBs minimal media condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we found that the type III
secretion genes are there, what we did is
[SPEAKER_00]: we pulled out all the mutants we have on
type III and did motility assays with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that they weren't really
affecting motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only other explanation is they were
on and they were taking a toll on the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism or on the energy for the
bacteria so that their growth might be
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively affected by having them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our hypothesis for why we might
have those hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no further questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's thank Igor.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
