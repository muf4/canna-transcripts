[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit more height impaired than
Don, so I hope everybody can see me from
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the nose above over this monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see all these familiar faces
and some new ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm back in plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have had this over at the Neven
Welkin Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hello, Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be talking a little bit about
biocultural conservation, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through slowly getting to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then talk about why it's important
that botanic gardens play a role both in
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental or biological conservation,
as well as cultural and linguistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure I find the right
button here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, just a little bit about
plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't get out much,
or for those who are newer than I,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be just useful to just have a
little brief overview as to who we are and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our mission, if you just want to boil
it down to three words, is probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: much different from any other public
garden in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're involved in cultivation of plants,
of course, and their display,
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation, which includes these days
also a very heavy focus on sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: and sustainable practices, and education,
both formal and informal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the way we do these things with
a high level of professionalism,
[SPEAKER_00]: curatorial professionalism, we do consider
ourselves as do zoos and aquaria as living
[SPEAKER_00]: museums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We curate our collections with the highest
degree of professional accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know everything about every
plant that comes in, where it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's doing, what its health is,
its provenance, all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this makes the collections that we
have much more useful and easier to be
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated into various scientific and
academic activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as such, we're integral to cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as to Cornell more broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that more broadly part that I
think may become a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent as we go through this in terms of
other kinds of academic pursuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for those who don't get out
much, plantations is a fairly complex
[SPEAKER_00]: entity with the Botanic Gardens around the
Welcome Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They arboretum across the way here,
as well as 34 natural areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the total land area is somewhere around
3,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hectares, acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a place that provides solace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides places for recreation,
informal and formal education.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was saying before, places in which
faculty can bring their students or
[SPEAKER_00]: students can bring themselves down there
and learn and study and reflect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our collections are based on any number
of different themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may be more geographic or ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some more horticultural or taxonomic,
such as the Rhododendron Garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Robeson York State Herb Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam Schade is the gardener extraordinaire
for this plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best but reputed to be one
of the best herb gardens in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's absolutely a fantastic resource
for anybody who's interested in the ways
[SPEAKER_00]: in which herbs have been used for culinary
purposes, medicinal purposes, and art,
[SPEAKER_00]: and literature, and the like, and through
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Don was sort of alluding to the
weather right now and how am I adapting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm doing fine, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Hawaii on Wednesday for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even this time of year, there's plenty
to do outside in terms of horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter interest as a horticulturist or
landscape architects say of gardens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter can be quite stunning and striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you more of an opportunity to
look at parts of the plant other than the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the bark, and the color,
and buds, and fruits that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Muellerstein Family Winter Garden
is a fantastic resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's the 100 Acre Arboretum,
all the natural areas that are around us,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cascadilla and Fall Creek Gorge
Trails, which are all part of our under
[SPEAKER_00]: our purview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting into some of the
sustainability things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked about the Nevid Welcome
Center, but you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Don knows more about this than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's certified the Biaswell Garden,
helping manage some of the runoff that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the surrounding area,
the parking lots, et cetera, and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering it, biofiltering it before the
water gets into Beebe Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the faculty and student research is
something that I really want to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: great deal of emphasis on in the next few
years, not just to our sort of kinship in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant sciences and horticulture and
environmental sciences, but also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: humanities as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring more artists down there and
musicians and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really bulk up our education programs
so that we appeal to a broad cadre of
[SPEAKER_00]: students, be they people who are looking
for formal education or those who are just
[SPEAKER_00]: coming for a more informal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me and for many of us here,
plants are inspirational.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inspire us in terms of our research
or in terms of the way we manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens at home or at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've inspired some people to serve
rather perplexing ways of displaying
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in some places, such as in
Versailles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also they inspire in terms of other
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have charismatic mega fauna,
such as the panda bear and the elephants
[SPEAKER_00]: and this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have charismatic mega flora as
well, for Christ's sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to try and get people involved
and excited about the world of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: through any kinds of hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants and nature and natural systems
have inspired the arts in any number of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of my favorite recent
novels, Barbara Kingsolver's Particle
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer, which has a great exposition of
how nature works, but also how people
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with nature and some of the
conflicts that are there and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ways in which those two different types of
systems mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it shows up in art through
the painting through the ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Childe Hassam's painting of Celia
Faxor's garden at what's now Scholl's
[SPEAKER_00]: Marine Lab or Appledore Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Celia Faxor in her garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're inspired by the art, but the art
was inspired by the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all comes sort of full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can come full circle in other ways
too, such as putting art in the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as Chihuly's glassworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a recent, well not that recent,
I guess almost 10 years ago, installation
[SPEAKER_00]: at Phipps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dale Chihuly has been traipsing around
the world, putting in his glasswork in
[SPEAKER_00]: various places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is great to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people come just for the art and forget
to look at anything else around it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that much has been achieved,
other than the cash register ringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, here we have these
sculptures, which were part of a student
[SPEAKER_00]: project back in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are now sculptures in the
Arboretum, but actually the Arboretum came
[SPEAKER_00]: later, probably about 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were put in in the early 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Arboretum wasn't officially
established until 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole thing sort of, you might
say, sort of this forest grew up around
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jack Elliott, who's over in human
ecology, his sculpture, well actually it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a sculpture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a maple root structure that was in
front of the Johnson Museum for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had it transported down to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ways in which we can engage people
in art that has a botanical or
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental focus, and then get them
hooked, and then get more talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and what they mean to them in their
daily lives and in today's society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the unfortunate aspects of
today's society is that many of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and natural resources or systems that we
study are increasingly threatened by one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing being land use changes and
deforestation, invasive species,
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, for instance, this has an impact
not just, climate change has an impact not
[SPEAKER_00]: only on natural systems, but on gardening
and how we garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the Hardiness Zone map from
1919.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here we are firmly ensconced
in zone five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is zone three up here,
the dark area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here in the 2006 version,
we're almost out of zone five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look what happened to zone three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost non-existent in the
conterminous United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has a great impact on gardening as
well as our ability to manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: collections in botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to be thinking ahead as to how
we're going to manage our collections in
[SPEAKER_00]: the light of these changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one great thing about being a living
museum and keeping great records on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that we do is we can look at
phenological data that we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: archives and in our notebooks and look to
see how phenological events have changed
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing this in Chicago and also
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Royal Botanic Garden Q has been doing
a lot of work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have colleagues in Boston,
too, Richard Primack, who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: publishing quite extensively on this
phenomenon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the flowering dates of
Neurocystis at Q, back in the 1950s,
[SPEAKER_00]: the average flowering date was the 9th of
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's late January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost a six-week shift in the
flowering phenology just of that one
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did this for about two dozen
different spring flowering ephemerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials, too, and see a very similar
shift anywhere from about four weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got an email from a friend in
Germany last week saying, spring is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, already?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these various environmental issues pose
a great threat to the plant life of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris Thomas published a paper about
10 years ago looking at how many species
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world are, quote unquote,
committed to extinction if the current
[SPEAKER_00]: trends continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for separating out plants from
everything else, he indicated that
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you are in the Amazon,
for instance, and what's already been
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in certain places within the
Amazon, anywhere from 50% to 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flora there is at risk of extinction in
the next 50 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Europe, it's not quite so bad,
not because it's a more resilient system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because so much has already been wiped
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only very little left to be wiped
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Norm Myers and others since him have
developed what we call biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspots, which are just regions of the
world where the flora and fauna is a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular risk of extinction due to some
of those factors that I've already
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, and as you can see from
here, these tend to be in the tropics and
[SPEAKER_00]: subtropics and in the Mediterranean
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you say, well, out of a
crisis comes opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an opportunity for us,
I suppose, as a profession in horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Botanic Garden community,
to take a leadership role in better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and communicating about some
of these issues that are happening and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that they will have on the natural
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: British ecologist William Sutherland was
looking at all of this and looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: endangerment of birds and mammals using
the IUCN, that's the International Union
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Conservation of Nature,
using their red listing criteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and determined that of the almost 10,000
species of bird in the world, 12% of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are at risk of extinction in the next few
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 4,500 or so species of mammals,
24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said to himself, well,
that's for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try and use these IUCN criteria for
endangerment and see how they might apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to something else like endangered
languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he tried to shoehorn some of these
things into those criteria and came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a number of 25% of the world's
languages are endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bits of our humanity are as threatened
as other aspects of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's actually a quite a low
estimate because there are better ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: estimating the percentages of languages
that are endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And UNESCO uses a fairly rigorous set of
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they estimated that about 50% of the
7,000 existing languages are endangered
[SPEAKER_00]: and long-term trends losing a language
about every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about this time last year, there was
the last living speaker of a language in
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotland called the Fisherfolk language.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person died, so that language is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was something in the press maybe
several weeks ago about the last speaker
[SPEAKER_00]: of a Native American language in the
Southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this happening more and
more, more and more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who study endangered languages
have tried to mimic some of this hotspot
[SPEAKER_00]: theme and looking at language extinction
hotspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as you might expect,
the greatest vulnerability is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics and subtropics, where natural
systems are being rapidly degraded by
[SPEAKER_00]: deforestation and resource extraction and
native peoples and indigenous peoples
[SPEAKER_00]: being displaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are other pockets up in
Northwestern North America and
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeastern Russia and China as well for
their small isolated indigenous groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at the relationship,
so what we're seeing here is the explicit
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, cause and effect
relationship, between the loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: biological diversity around the world and
the loss of linguistic and cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one erodes away is taking the other's
down with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this examination of the
relationship between biological
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation and cultural or linguistic
conservation we call bio-cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an area I think gardens can
become more deeply engaged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we lose a culture or language,
we lose the information that they have,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call the indigenous ecological
knowledge or traditional ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge about the natural world around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a lecture last year from by a
woman who's, I don't know what you call
[SPEAKER_00]: her, maybe an ethnomusicologist,
but she was looking at aboriginal dances
[SPEAKER_00]: in various groups throughout Northern
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was showing these videos of these
people dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she was sort of breaking it down,
parsing it down, showing how each motion
[SPEAKER_00]: had something to do with the life cycle of
a species of bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it fledged, when it bred,
how many offspring it had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole ritual around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once that language is gone,
then all that knowledge we may call it
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous or traditional ecological
knowledge, but it's damn good ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all the poorer for it as
humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were in Hawaii or a native
Hawaiian, and any one of these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were to disappear, then the native
Hawaiian culture, which is now going
[SPEAKER_00]: through a renaissance, would lose a
significant portion of its identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the taro, which is an important staple
crop, the koa, or acacia koa, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: used for building canoes and other
utilitarian vessels, the ohia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hua, the metrocideros, which is used
in lei making and other kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might refer to these as sort
of cultural keystone species as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological keystone species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're central to the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they're gone, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a taro, as some of you might know,
is a sacred plant throughout many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific island cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that that's their ancestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't get into the mythology of that
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Vanua Lava, for instance,
the residents there say, we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate taro to live, but live to
cultivate taro because it's keeping alive
[SPEAKER_00]: their ancestral heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you follow the news about GMO and
all that kind of thing, there's been quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of hue and cry about this,
particularly in the Pacific islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it worked OK with the papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there was a Cornell breeder
who came up with the ringspot resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's now being widely grown in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also diseases of taro that have
been going through the Pacific from time
[SPEAKER_00]: to time and wiped out much of the taro
cultivation in Samoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they resorted reluctantly to using
GMO taro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Hawaiians said no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vanua Lavans said no way because you
don't do GMO on your ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just heretical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of instances in
which sort of quote unquote Western
[SPEAKER_00]: science or Western approach shows the
things that conflicted or intersected with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other traditional ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an opportunity for learning more
about how other cultures see the world
[SPEAKER_00]: around them and appreciate that more
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with respect to sea level rise,
again, in the Pacific, the Republic of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiribati, which is about 32 flat coral
atolls, no more than two meters high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a trivia thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody says, so what's the only
country in the world which is present in
[SPEAKER_00]: all four hemispheres?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be Kiribati because the
international date line comes right down
[SPEAKER_00]: here and the equator goes right through
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in all four hemispheres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so sea level rise, just a few
centimeters of sea level rise is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause huge issues as it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the capital town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are people who have never seen water
above their knees on these atolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now already up to their ankles or
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now what they're doing is trying to
find a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be one of the first full
entire nations that has sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental refugee status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiji, at the time I put this together,
negotiating to buy another negotiating,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we just please live there,
5,000 acres in Fiji.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiji is saying no at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're seeing that either
Australia or New Zealand will take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 100,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you go a little further afield up
to the Northwest, North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is Alaska in the Northwest
Territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about two dozen different
languages and cultures here of First
[SPEAKER_00]: Nations people or whatever the appropriate
term is these days, any one of which is
[SPEAKER_00]: dwindling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this area up here with
the Inupiat are in the far northern part.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sea water temperature rises,
they're finding the whales and other
[SPEAKER_00]: mammals and animals that they hunt are
moving further north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're out there hunting in these
rudimentary canoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't get out as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they may be able to get out as far,
but there's nowhere they're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: back in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their ability to hunt for the
resources that they need is being
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice write-up about this in a
book recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kivalina, that's the name of the town in
which they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these environmental changes are
changing the natural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's having a direct consequence on the
cultural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is part of their landscape that's
just literally melting and going away and
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who study this botanists and
ethnobotanists, anthropologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: linguists have been trying to develop a
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we display or portray this
biocultural diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed languages in terms of hot spots,
biological hot spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about this biocultural thing
combining the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult because they're two
very different types of data and
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combining the two into a single index
is almost sort of impossible, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a very crude attempt by
David Lowen, John Harmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: An entire country is encoded a single
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even here, an entire continent,
certain colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the deeper the color, the more
endangered are both the biological
[SPEAKER_00]: elements and the cultural elements within
that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't show, therefore,
because of the lack of fine grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these areas up here or up here in
the Northwest, or even across northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, where there are huge numbers of
very small indigenous groups remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was another attempt that UNESCO did
along with the World Wildlife Fund that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just as unsatisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors here are just depicting the
bioregions of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't see at this scale,
but there are just little dots everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows where an endangered culture
or endangered language is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just superimpose one thing over
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is still a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rare plant in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extinct in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cyania truncata.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only place in the world you can see
this is in a test tube at the Lyon
[SPEAKER_00]: Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can do is we can clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every individual will be genetically
identical, but at least we can clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a habitat suitable,
we can put it back out into nature once we
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these things up in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't put a culture in a test
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once a culture is gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no lesser person than Francois Jacob,
the Nobel laureate in medicine in 1965,
[SPEAKER_00]: said that in humans, natural diversity is
further strengthened by cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that we can, as we develop
our program, more at the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Plantations and with partnership from
people at Cornell, other departments,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can dive into this issue more
deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of international
entities, treaties, and conventions and
[SPEAKER_00]: such that will draw these two issues
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Convention on Biological Diversity,
which every nation in the world has
[SPEAKER_00]: ratified except the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Herbert Walker signed it,
but Congress didn't ratify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to live up to its tenets,
to its articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no mandate that we do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it seems to be the right thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people who work in gardens and
museums respect the Convention on
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological Diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a number of places within this
convention, including this Article 8j,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do refer to maintaining indigenous
and local communities for the conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: and sustainable use of biological
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're making an attempt here,
again, to bring these two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do the one without the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's a little bit more close
to home for those in the botanic garden
[SPEAKER_00]: world is the Global Strategy for Plant
Conservation, which came out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Convention on Biological Diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of us from gardens around the
world worked quite a bit on developing
[SPEAKER_00]: this over the last 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had targets from 2000, 2010,
and now we have new targets from 2010 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, such as inventorying and having
electronical databases that document every
[SPEAKER_00]: living plant in the world and all these
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how are we going to preserve what
we have unless we know exactly what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have and know the full extent of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these targets, again,
like the Convention on Biological
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity, again, refers to this
intersection between biological and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural conservation, halting the decline
of plant resources and associated
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous and local knowledge,
innovations, and practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a snippet out of that
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get the gist of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are 18 or 20 of these
targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have to do, as I said,
with digitizing the floor of the world and
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of things, where you can say,
yes, we've done this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done 75% of it, or 85%, or whatever
the case may be, developing new
[SPEAKER_00]: educational programs or communication
strategies around all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much harder one to get a grip
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one that tends to be ignored
just because it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gardens are addressing this
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who have been to New York
much or been to Queens Botanic Garden know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's probably in one of the most
ethnically diverse places in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've made an explicit attempt to
draw in the various ethnic groups that are
[SPEAKER_00]: within their area and give them a place
where they can express themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: culturally, particularly as it relates to
foods and plants and that within their
[SPEAKER_00]: daily lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have a number of events,
a number of festivals that aren't catered
[SPEAKER_00]: just for Filipinos to Filipinos,
but Filipinos to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody can get a taste figuratively
and literally of what that culture
[SPEAKER_00]: represents and how plants are centrally
important to the maintenance of their
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on and off with Her
Highness Basma bin Ali in Jordan,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is establishing a network of new
botanic gardens throughout Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a main central garden in Amman
and then other satellite gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those satellite ones are intended to
do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to showcase the biota and the
biological diversity of that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is to show the cultural
significance of the peoples in that region
[SPEAKER_00]: because they vary from place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, even though she's not
calling it that, these are biocultural
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's financing these personally
because the government is not doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though she's part of the royal
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's doing it herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another place that's doing this,
and I consulted with them briefly a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years ago, is in South Korea,
where they're building a new city
[SPEAKER_00]: southwest of Seoul.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be about three times the
size of Paris or some sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a scale model that they have
in the visitor center showcasing this new
[SPEAKER_00]: big R&D and city and have all these fancy
apartments and all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing they've done so far is
build the seawall, which is the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: longest seawall, 35 kilometers long,
with a four-lane highway on the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: two-lane highways on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really grotesque in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're doing this in this estuary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only saving grace, and the
lighting in here doesn't allow it to show
[SPEAKER_00]: up very clearly, is right in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they wanted me to come there
for, is they're building a 100-hectare
[SPEAKER_00]: biocultural garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a garden that
showcases the biological heritage and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural heritage of that part of the
Korean peninsula and the Chinese mainland
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just across the sea from there,
which I thought was quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not particularly a fan of the rest of
what they're proposing to do here,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly all these big golf courses
and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a plan, and these things
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given the current economic state of
the world, it's probably just as likely
[SPEAKER_00]: that this will never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people who are thinking
about this, at least, in terms of how can
[SPEAKER_00]: we bring people and the cultural heritage
of the world more close to the issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're facing with respect to conserving
the natural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Don alluded to, when I was at
University of Hawaii, I established a
[SPEAKER_00]: center for biocultural studies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was draw in people from
anthropology and biology, linguistics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the law school, as they had law faculty
who were looking at climate change and its
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on indigenous peoples and resource
extraction, indigenous intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property rights, and all these kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ran the gamut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there probably was very few
departments at the university that didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some way, have some connection to this
particular issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we developed partnerships as part of
that in MOUs with the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Auckland and New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were doing in Hawaii relates to
what was going on there with the Maori
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: UNESCO is interested in this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The University of South Pacific in Fiji,
the Smithsonian, through their Recovering
[SPEAKER_00]: Voices program, the East West Centre,
which is a nonprofit big think tank in
[SPEAKER_00]: Honolulu, looking at ways in which Western
and Eastern cultures can intersect and
[SPEAKER_00]: support one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of articulating what
the issues are and making connections with
[SPEAKER_00]: people in other disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We held a, which is now every other year,
an international conference on endangered
[SPEAKER_00]: languages at the University of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had people come there from all over
the world, including people from Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent six people to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea they were coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, announced themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the conference, they said,
we want to help you build a website just
[SPEAKER_00]: for endangered languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They built it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all we have to do all is find the
linguists, ethnobotanists,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnomusicologists, and others who are
documenting endangered languages and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures and put their information on this
publicly accessible site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a well-managed or well-edited
wiki, really, is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people now at the University
of Hawaii who manage this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as new information comes in,
they've got to make sure it's all up to
[SPEAKER_00]: snuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, bringing all this back closer to
home, you say, what the hell does this
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do with the Kern Cornell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the white pine tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I shouldn't have said this is a white
pine tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said, who knows what this
tree is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an iconic tree in the northern
mixed hardwoods forests everywhere from
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota to the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it holds a special place in Native
American culture, the Haudenosaunee,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I said that right, Confederacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the original MOOCs, M-O-O-C-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga,
and Seneca.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember MOOCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you in higher education and
stuff, you know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to them, the white pine is a very key
element of their cultural history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a display on this at the Nevin
Malcolm Center when I first came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just by happenstance that I'm
interested in this and happened to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or somebody said, hmm, let's get this guy
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so there's all the symbolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have how many needles in the
fascicle, per fascicle, of a white pine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they represent each of those Native
American nations that are part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: Confederacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some symbolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an eagle on the top of the tree
and all this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a tree falls over, if it's tipped
over in a windstorm or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: the root ball comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got this big depression in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they would bury their
weapons and then cover them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the rainwater, the stream,
or whatever would carry away that
[SPEAKER_00]: violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the end of war, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so they call it here the tree of
the great long leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also referred to in their culture
as the tree of peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the white pine were to disappear,
not that it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has been threatened over centuries
by logging, over logging one disease or
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that something like this
could disappear from a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there goes another piece of that
culture's integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some other things we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Don Reikau can speak to these much
more expertly than can I.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also refer to and acknowledge
and respect other cultures just through
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we plan on continuing to promote
this East Asian garden that Don was
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in developing as a way to get
people more engaged in Asian cultures and
[SPEAKER_00]: how plants have been used in those
cultures for ornamental aesthetic and
[SPEAKER_00]: other purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be some focus, unless things
change dramatically, on some aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean-Japanese and Korean culture and how
they use plants in various ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not just a, if you think about
19% I read of Cornell undergraduate
[SPEAKER_00]: self-identify as Asian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's either Asian-American or from
Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming here from Asia for school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a significant population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's very little here that's for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have to do something just for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also an opportunity for us to
learn more about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the peony and perennial garden,
which may be in that great lawn area or a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of it, depending on how the
fundraising goes and all this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, things always change and scales
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peonies are another plant that are
very important, some aspects of Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture and gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways in which we can draw
different cultures in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we can explore out in
any number of different avenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're wondering what the hell was
that all about, here's the summary slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a living museum, so we have to
maintain our horticulture and educational
[SPEAKER_00]: excellence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes without saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people say, well, you're not going
to be a botanic gardener anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be a better one and a more
impactful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to remain indispensable to
Cornell, to the faculty, to the students,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forge relationships and partnerships
with people in other disciplines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the humanities in particular,
and social sciences, and do more in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of informing people about this intimate
link and this sort of co-evolutionary link
[SPEAKER_00]: between nature and cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually like to close things by this
phrase from Shakespeare that he put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: words of Ulysses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think otherwise, I just can't get
through Troilus and Cressida.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he said that one touch of
nature makes the whole world kin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we use this as our mantra
moving forward and think about this nature
[SPEAKER_00]: and culture thing, we will have left the
world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how many of you are graduate
students?
Or undergraduate students?
How can you support these people?
So do you take courses in some of these
other areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had graduate students come to me from
time to time and say, what are your best
[SPEAKER_00]: career advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, don't focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get so deeply embedded in that
statistics course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things that relate to getting together
in that particular field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make course catalogs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a hard copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think back in the day you could
just go like this, and then stick your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to take that
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the musicology of whatever the case
may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that maybe you're better at
whatever you want to be when you grow up,
personally, to expand, take courses in
anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we go in and take this somewhere
where the case may be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben, yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: You alluded to plantations moving more
actively toward the humanities and social
[SPEAKER_04]: sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there particular departments within
Cornell that you're seeking to build
[SPEAKER_02]: those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're doing some of that through the
lecture series that I have with Paul and
[SPEAKER_00]: with Sonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pretty good relationship now
with the English department.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to expand on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theater, filmmaking, there's a fellow,
Toby Macau, who's a political,
[SPEAKER_00]: all sacred plants project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been going around the world
videotaping these different cultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the disappearing cultures,
and talking to them, interviewing them
[SPEAKER_00]: about their relationship to the landscape
around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm interested in working with people
like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't work with them directly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring some of these people in,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sonja doesn't know this, but I'm
thinking about ways in which we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this information out through these
lecture series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what if we had this woman who's
Indian who did this, I don't know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: call it, multimedia kind of thing called
Himalayan snow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she's looking at climate change in
the Himalayas, the snow melting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the glaciers melting, and the impact
that's having on those cultures that live
[SPEAKER_00]: in and around the mountains there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what impact that cultural loss is
having on her culture in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now her culture there is
disappearing, so she's dealing with this
[SPEAKER_00]: loss herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can connect those dots
generationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can connect them geographically,
spatially, and temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what she does is she has this video
thing that's playing while she's talking
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this ethnic music that's
playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's extremely powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want it to be pedantic,
necessarily, or lecturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get more into these things,
we need to not only approach the
[SPEAKER_00]: humanities, but to some extent,
we also need to take that humanities
[SPEAKER_00]: approach in some ways to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Jane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really pleased to see when you were
talking about biocultural diversity that
[SPEAKER_02]: then you brought the issue back to kind of
where we are today with the Haudenosaunee
[SPEAKER_02]: and Iroquois.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the issues that,
I mean, it sounds easy to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: preserving plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody wants to protect the white
pine or the black ash or those types of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thinking about forming partnerships
with native peoples in the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the place where that gets hard is in
terms of political sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this last year, 2014, was the 400th
year of the Two Road Wampum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which represents the political agreement
between Iroquois Haudenosaunee peoples and
[SPEAKER_02]: non-native peoples.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started with the Dutch, but then it
also kind of frames the relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: between the Haudenosaunee and US people
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where that comes, the kind of rubber
meets the road in difficulty, is that much
[SPEAKER_02]: of New York state is under land claim
conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that these people, for whom we
would like to save the white pine,
[SPEAKER_02]: have serious and legitimate claims to
property in New York state based on
[SPEAKER_02]: political sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to not recognize that is to kind of
frame the question in not a trivial way,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in a way that doesn't really recognize
the native indigenous peoples in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: state, in northern North America,
are indigenous political entities with the
[SPEAKER_02]: desires to have their own land,
their own government, and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so biocultural conservation,
when we form partnerships like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be effective, the very first thing has
to recognize the political sovereignty of
[SPEAKER_02]: those groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I salute you for bringing up the
biocultural diversity and say let's not
[SPEAKER_02]: forget that there is political and all
sorts of issues that go along with this
[SPEAKER_02]: right here in our own backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talk to people in the county about how
friendly they are with the nation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll probably get slapped in the
face, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't like the key,
and they could care less about the white
[SPEAKER_02]: pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was setting up this, I agree with
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was setting this thing up in
Hawaii, we did get, it was the Native
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans involved, we had a lot of Native
Americans, I mean Native Hawaiians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native Hawaiians on the faculty there were
all engaged in this, in the Native
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian Studies program as well as in the
law school and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we did bring in all that whole
political thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty dynamic system there too
in Hawaii and in Aotearoa, New Zealand
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Nare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through these different partnerships,
you develop respect, and from there you
[SPEAKER_00]: can work together and try to resolve some
of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's working out quite well in Hawaii
right now, and Aotearoa is working out
[SPEAKER_00]: very well, and I have no doubt that the
situation here will be resolved in some
[SPEAKER_00]: way that don't everybody's unhappy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Christopher, it seems that in considering
this rapid loss of Indigenous language
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's either being caused by
geographic changes such as these people
[SPEAKER_04]: living on the atolls no longer being able
to live there because of rising ocean
[SPEAKER_04]: levels, or because members of the groups
that speak those languages are migrating
[SPEAKER_04]: to cities and no longer identifying with
their culture, or the people are just
[SPEAKER_04]: dying out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So given those factors, what
realistically, practically can be done to
[SPEAKER_04]: preserve these dying languages?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's where we work with
anthropologists and linguistics more than
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to help us with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally what happens is that you go
to these places where this is occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you interview the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them say, we don't want your
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We die out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be better off if we did assimilate
into a larger different culture than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't impose anything on anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these languages and cultures
are going to die out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what they want,
for one reason or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many in which they do want their
culture to be archived.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only good thing is to separate the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the least we can do is archive it,
or posterity it, and understand it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have it interpreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know with all these words,
and stories, and songs, and dances,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning, and getting the information from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening in some places is that
since we've been in language training
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, many of the older people talk
about how to teach a language to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who doesn't speak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're bringing people who can help with
that, developing language forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also developed a company that we're
working with, additional support in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it written out in their
language, what these plans are,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are these programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use those as teaching tools for
the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not an expert in that, but there
are any number of different ways in which
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that can be reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big thing, in order for a language
to remain viable, is that it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: passed down from generation to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're looking to see if the
language is in danger, that's the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the language being transmitted?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it isn't being transmitted,
then you have to look at why.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to reverse that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've noticed from students and
the public is that the incredible interest
[SPEAKER_03]: in plants and medicine and health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's rare that you go to gardens
anywhere where they're really very
[SPEAKER_03]: conscious of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the public is constantly consuming
all kinds of botanical stuff, of which
[SPEAKER_03]: they're clueless what they're taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a multi-billion industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think my question is, how can gardens
get into a topic which deals with
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, deals with health, which
everybody's interested in, and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: touch, especially in the ancient medicine,
on the American Indians, from North
[SPEAKER_03]: America, South America.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is an incredible well,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just trying to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the herb garden at the plantations,
we have 17 themed beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two beds that are devoted to
medicinal plants, many of which originate
[SPEAKER_01]: in Western and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: European culture and a few from China and
a few from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have one of the themed beds is
Herbs of the Native of American Indians.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very small and they are located all
around us in the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trees are medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shrubs are medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're featured all around us,
not just within this confines of this very
[SPEAKER_01]: small bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wildflower garden at the
plantations has the woodland native
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, some of which are medicinal and
some are edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's through interpretive programs,
I think, that we can learn a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: because we can only feature a very small
percentage within the context of the herb
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then bring in guest speakers,
native guest speakers, have Jane give us
[SPEAKER_01]: some programs and maybe network,
help us network with the indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a state historic park called
Finondagon, which is in Victor,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, outside of Victor, New York,
about an hour and a half north of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are state park on the site of an
old Seneca historic village where they had
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 longhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a magnificent site, a great
resource for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the collections that in the
garden is available to those on the
[SPEAKER_00]: campus, if you're saying that,
researchers and students and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they can use the plant materials,
they can extract the chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can test them and see if they do have
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of thing, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can be a resource for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of our mission,
is to be a resource for you to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that work and your students will be
able to do that work for the betterment of
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever we can do, to assist in that,
that's what we're there for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to cut things off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to again thank Dr. Dullen for that
fascinating lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
