[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to thank the students for
inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always really an honor to be invited
by the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never quite know why they picked you,
but this is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so today I'm going to talk to you
about responses to DNA damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And responses to an acute dose of heavy
DNA damage can go on for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're mostly going to focus on
are these immediate responses that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the very same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: As being hit by this acute dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things have to do with,
well, this is tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of responses are really
responses to the damage that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: inducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downstream things have more to do with
responses to the responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some cells have died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have to be replenished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that very briefly,
because my talk is probably too long
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so our model DNA damaging agent,
which we're going to use throughout this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, are gamma rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make it clear what gamma rays do,
the rays themselves do not probably induce
[SPEAKER_00]: many double strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They zip right through the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great majority of them are not even
going to interact with any of the matter
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to go right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if one is lucky, it might interact
probably with a water molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the most common molecule in
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to spit out, through Compton
scattering, a very high energy electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That electron can travel quite far in the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it happens to come to a stop within
the cell, it'll deposit all of that energy
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little burst of reactive oxygen
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really quite an indirect
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's making several different types of
damage right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, most of the damage will be to
water, because most of the cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: components are water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that little burst happens to lodge
in the nucleus, it has a good chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the burst itself happens within a
certain radius, which just by chance is
[SPEAKER_00]: about the same as the radius of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get multiple damage to both
sides of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you don't have a good
template strand for repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible you could introduce a break
in the backbone to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also repair activities will introduce
double strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may take time for those breaks to
be induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are going to happen gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the burst could have been over
here, and you get single sided damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if the burst happened to be right where
a DNA molecule was, you'll get a double
[SPEAKER_00]: strand break eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, double strand breaks sound horrific,
but they actually have very little
[SPEAKER_00]: biological significance, provided the cell
doesn't divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only point of having genes be
connected to a chromosome is if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do cell division again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole point of being on a
chromosome is to be attached to a
[SPEAKER_00]: centromere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cell doesn't need to divide,
the DNA can still replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can still do transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many origins of replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything can be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only in the context of cell division
that you'd end up losing a chromosome arm,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no centromere here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in yeast, you would end up with a
dead daughter cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've lost a chromosome arm,
it's going to carry something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: essential on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as cell division doesn't
happen, double strand breaks are not a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the immediate DNA damage response,
the stuff that happens in the same day as
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA damage, is to have some sort of
system for monitoring the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that system has to talk to the cell
and give it some good ideas, like
[SPEAKER_00]: arresting progression of the cell cycle
until that signal disappears, maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: inducing repair if that's something that
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both bacteria and eukaryotes are
extremely, exquisitely sensitive to the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of double strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in yeast, a single double strand
breaks in a completely unnecessary plasmid
[SPEAKER_00]: will prevent cell cycle progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yeast and other single-celled
organisms, if they detect the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: a break for several days and it's clear
that it's never going to go away,
[SPEAKER_00]: since they're single-celled organisms,
they might as well give it a shot,
[SPEAKER_00]: go on with replication, maybe they'll find
they didn't need that chromosome arm after
[SPEAKER_00]: all in their daughter's cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an animal, that's a risky thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carry a huge genetic load on our
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go from being heterozygous for a
mutation on one of those arms to
[SPEAKER_00]: uncovering that recessive mutation,
it can easily lead to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have trillions of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our case, rather than adapt to the
presence of double strand breaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell would decide to die or
permanently arrest instead so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: never undergoes cell division and exposes
that deleterious allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question we're asking here is what
about plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do plants have the exact same issue as
single-celled organisms or animals or are
[SPEAKER_00]: they somewhere in between?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we expect plants to have programmed
cell cycle responses to DNA damage at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we do because it's a very
sensible thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just play devil's advocate
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a second here, plants are diploid and
often polyploid, and they tolerate
[SPEAKER_00]: aneuploidy well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have backup copies of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, I'm working with Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis is a self-pollinating
organism, so it's homozygous for all loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to be exposing
heterozygosity by losing a chromosome arm
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's already totally inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cells can't move, so cancers can't
metastasize, so even if you messed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of the cell cycle in a single
cell, you might end up with a tumor on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but you'd probably not end up with
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in the case of Arabidopsis,
we have a 10-week life cycle anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant development is extremely flexible,
so if some cells are messed up and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to take off on their own,
and there aren't many examples of them
[SPEAKER_00]: ever doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know viruses or bacteria can reprogram
cells, but cells rarely ignore the signals
[SPEAKER_00]: from other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of the flexibility
of plant growth in that you can take a fig
[SPEAKER_00]: tree in this case, a ficus, and you can
turn it into boards, and you can pound
[SPEAKER_00]: them into ground and staple barbed wire to
them, and if there's any living tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: still in the board, it'll make another
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So animals don't do this, but plants can
easily do this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can work around a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, still, why not do cell cycle arrest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason not to is plants compete
for resources only through growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can run around and compete for
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these plants, two little seedlings are
growing next to each other, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: competing for light, if one gets bigger
than the other, even transiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll overshadow the other and have an
exponential advantage that will never
[SPEAKER_00]: stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little like uncontrolled
capitalism, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have government regulations
in place, as soon as one person gets rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can dominate all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, sorry, yeah, plants have
to worry about growth rate versus genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: purity, which is really a more important
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this immediately leads us to think
about somatic versus germline cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's okay to grow like mad and
ignore genome fidelity as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: outpacing your competitors, but the
germline perhaps is something you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want that to happen in, and unfortunately,
I'm not gonna be talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: germline in this talk at all because it's
harder to look at than the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, I'll talk a little bit about
meristematic versus terminally
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiated cells and how their
responses might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so do double strand breaks
occur at all in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no natural source of radiation
that plants really have to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of doses I'm using are enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you were growing plants in
Chernobyl, where they grow just fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't get this sort of dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so double strand breaks are
generated during DNA replication quite
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are single-ended double strand
breaks due to breakage of a replication
[SPEAKER_00]: fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larger genomes will have bigger
problems with this sort of issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's an example of what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a replication fork and there's
maybe a single-sided, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lesion, just one base, DNA polymerase is
very fastidious and it doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate past that, it's gonna leave
single-stranded DNA on both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: sides, and that is a very fragile thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's quite likely for one of these
branches to break off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is essentially in a complete
chromosome, that's fine, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome that has a break and nothing to
rejoin it to, so that's a single-ended
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every round of replication,
this probably happens in every cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arabidopsis, the genome size is 1.30,
the size of maize, so I think it would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen 30 times more often in maize than
in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double strand breaks can also be generated
naturally during desiccation and
[SPEAKER_00]: rehydration, and I don't mean drought,
I mean desiccation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When biological tissues reach,
you know, air levels of humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just left out to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And animals, most animals, cannot
withstand desiccation, but some fungi can
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants can, seed plants do it,
every generation in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes pollen is desiccation-tolerant
and some kinds of pollen are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another example of where double
strand breaks could be generated
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, bigger genomes,
just because they have more DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a greater probability of getting a
double strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this damage acute?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, throughout this talk,
gonna be talking about acute damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Slam the plant with gamma radiation,
then I look at its recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than leaving it to grow on
something that induces double strand
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is damage to seeds acute?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends whether you believe that seeds,
in their desiccated cryptobiotic state,
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually still metabolically active in
repairing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is an older literature about the
fact that seeds, if you watch them
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate, they will undergo what's called
unscheduled DNA replication, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of the cells are doing a little
repair here and there, and once that
[SPEAKER_00]: period is done, then the seed will
actually proceed with cell division,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be cleaning up its genome
at the beginning of germination,
[SPEAKER_00]: after it's imbibed, and then it goes on
with its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little like suffering an acute
dose of DNA damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It suddenly wakens to the fact that it has
accumulated DNA damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, our model system is the
Arabidopsis seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has highly stereotypical development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what all the cells are doing
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lots of visually visualized cell
types and has a variety of cell cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this young Arabidopsis
seedling, the different cells are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, and this is a plant
audience mostly, so I could go through
[SPEAKER_00]: this pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an apical meristem here and an
apical meristem down here, and both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these regions are rapidly dividing,
and there's sort of a stem cell niche
[SPEAKER_00]: that's creating all these new cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are mitotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unlike animals, there's also a lot of
endoraduplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the growth of the hypocotyl
after germination is through expansion of
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, not cell division, and so those are
becoming endoraduplicated, undergoing S
[SPEAKER_00]: phase but not M phase, and the cells are
getting bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in the zone of elongation in
the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they're done being mitotic,
the cells will start to expand and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the copy number of the DNA
without undergoing cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of after that expansion is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at all kinds of different
cell cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we irradiate these seedlings,
every single cell is getting the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same dose of breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiation, as I said, goes right
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no higher dose to outside cells
than inside cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's getting the same dose,
but the cells have different destinies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so they might have different responses
to DNA damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, do plants exhibit program
responses to DNA damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, yes, I wouldn't be talking
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how, first, the questions,
more intellectual questions to ask are,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you know a response is programmed
rather than just a toxic effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you expose a plant to
drought, you might see it wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think, poor plant, it's
suffering from drought, but it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way, undergoing a programmed response
to that drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dropping its leaves, so it's not
picking up as much sun as it used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing this intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to distinguish between
intentional responses, which we call
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed, and toxic, inevitable effects
of ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for the programmed responses,
we'd like to know how they're regulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want to know what their biological
significance is, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so most cases, we will be
irradiating seedlings, but sometimes we
[SPEAKER_00]: irradiate seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the mature embryo of
Arabidopsis inside of its seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a root, but it has no true leaves,
no visible true leaves at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a meristem that will divide to
give true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you irradiate at this stage for
wild-type seeds, and we look a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks later, we have plenty of true
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spot them with their leaf hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 grays, basically no effect on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dose that is about 30 times the
dose that would kill a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the genome size is 1 30th that of a
human genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, it's not a lethal dose at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no effect on growth if irradiated
as seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we take that up to 500 grays,
which is about 150 double strand breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: per diploid G1 genome, we actually see
miniaturization of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cotyledons, everything that was in the
embryo is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gravitropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's phototropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not growing, and the cells are
miniaturized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that a toxic effect or a programmed
effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we can look at that's an
effect of ionizing radiation is
[SPEAKER_00]: mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this assay for mutagenesis
where we have a boster-resistant knockout
[SPEAKER_00]: of an allele that causes albinism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can select for heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be green, and they have to be
boster-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can irradiate those seeds and
ask what the rate of sectering is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rate of sectering, if you don't
irradiate the seeds, is zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't look at enough to find those
sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you irradiate them, you can produce
these sectors that reflect chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: loss, breakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large, broad net that catches
all mutations at this locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it maxes out at about 4% of plants
because the plants get smaller and smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: and smaller and smaller until you can't
look at sectors anymore as part of their
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed DNA damage response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that sectering mutagenesis itself,
it's hard to believe that's a programmed
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a toxic effect of ionizing
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you think cell death would also be a
toxic effect of ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason you die from five grays of
radiation is not because your epithelial
[SPEAKER_00]: intestinal lining is especially sensitive
to ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's sensitive to the
response to destroy itself in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you slough off all your epidermal
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, here if we look at plants,
we irradiate the whole root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets the same dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we get death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see a dead cell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: PI staining indicates that the cells can
no longer pump out PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they start to glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might say, well, maybe this is a
highly mitotic population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it more sensitive because it's
running through the cell cycle faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at the mitotic population
using cyclin B11 GFP as a marker,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that this whole mass of cells here
is highly mitotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not all dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's instead focused on the stem cells for
the steel of the root here, which suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's a programmed response rather
than a toxic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that cell's root tips do in
response to radiation is here's a root tip
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, four days old, eight days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a root cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see any root hairs because
they're farther up the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit them with ionizing radiation,
four days later, you can start to see root
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs as differentiation approaches the
root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root tip has stopped dividing and
stopped growing away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating zone that's coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: At eight days, all the cells have become
really massive and huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire root tip has swollen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are root hairs everywhere because
there's no cell division in the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root tip is not growing away from this
differentiation zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say that this is premature endo
reduplication and differentiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could say it's just waiting for a
differentiation to catch up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another cute phenotype is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at this DNA repair mutant,
XPF, that's defective in a flap
[SPEAKER_00]: endonuclease, we irradiate these plants as
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild type is not sensitive to this dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA repair mutant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cotyledons are still undergoing cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of cell division in a
cotyledon naturally, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of stomata, for example,
that's all post-embryonic, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cell divisions are still occurring,
but these cell divisions to make leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that suggests it's a programmed
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cells are undergoing arrest or death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other cells are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so how do we know which responses
are due to DNA damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ionizing radiation affects
everything in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we know which responses are
programmed versus direct effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to look at the responsibility of DNA
damage, we can't quite do that directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can do a fairly convincing
experiment where what we do is look at
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants that are defective in end-to-end
non-homologous end joining of
[SPEAKER_00]: double-strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a G1 cell, this is what's doing the
bulk of the DNA repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ends are simply re-ligated together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reasonably error-free process,
so long as the ends haven't been resected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also this gene, which I mentioned
before, XPF, which is the flap
[SPEAKER_00]: endonuclease, and is sometimes required
for some types of non-homologous end
[SPEAKER_00]: joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we can look at these,
and we can ask, if you're defective in
[SPEAKER_00]: double-strand break repair, do you mimic
the effects of ionizing radiation at a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know in the mutant that any
phenotype you see is due to this
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, and therefore due to
double-strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if we look at a DNA
ligase IV mutant, at zero grades of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, it's wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 100 grades of radiation, when
irradiated as seeds, it makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: miniaturized, tiny, cuddly little seedling
that's not going to grow again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this mimics the effects of 5G.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 100 grades of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, similarly, at only 20 grades of
radiation, before we looked at 100,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type is very slow to induce any cell
death in the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly focused there
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at DNA ligase IV at 20
grades, we can see within four hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: there starts to be cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also, apparently, a response to
double-strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean it's programmed, but it's a
response to double-strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, different kinds of
persisting DNA damage can induce different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just talked about XPF, having this
lovely phenotype that we call the gamma
[SPEAKER_00]: plantlet, in which everything is normal,
you know, hypocotyl development is normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: cotyledon development is normal,
but you're just not getting true leads,
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to DNA ligase IV at the same
dose, which has this highly miniaturized
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no dose of gamma radiation where
we can get like four to look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a matter of degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the cotyledons look this good,
we have true leaves also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a response to something that's
a very potent signal for telling these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells to not divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this is a response to something
that's making all cells miniaturized and
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this differential sensitivity
of these cells versus these cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, these still have cell division,
and they're still forming a stomata,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that this is a programmed
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we felt so strongly that
this was a programmed response that Sasha
[SPEAKER_00]: Prus was willing to undergo a genetic
screen to look for regulators of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a programmed response,
there must be something that's telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, here's a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you should do in response to
it, or whatever it is that XPF is
[SPEAKER_00]: repairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he took the XPF line, and he
mutagenized seeds with EMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he treated them actually with 100
grays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he looked for plants that could
grow in spite of the fact that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been irradiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's looking for true leaf production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found several mutants, and one of
them was SOG-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the leaves are not great,
but the phyllotoxy is normal, and the time
[SPEAKER_00]: at which they're produced is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaves are struggling, but they're
still emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've lost the ability to induce
probably a checkpoint in the apocrypha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SOG-1, as Tomo discovered,
is also defective in this program's cell
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at SOG-1, at zero,
four, and eight hours after irradiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: SOG-1 has no cell depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sensitive to ionizing irradiation
in the way it's resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because this is a programmed
response, and SOG-1 tells you it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed response, this is not
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a toxic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something the cells are doing
intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as to be entirely forthcoming
with you, if we go to the next day and we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at SOG-1 mutants, we do see cell
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's wild type 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this focused cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's SOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this checkerboard cell death
instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't got the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing, we go to 48 hours,
we see continuing cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is SOG-1 independent cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's programmed or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is clearly programmed, except at the
earlier time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if losing SOG-1 is so great
for the plant because it doesn't have cell
[SPEAKER_00]: death, and it can go on and divide in
spite of radiation, what is SOG-1 for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the same thing any checkpoint
protein is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to prevent the accumulation of
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we irradiate seeds, again,
with that albino pale green marker,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we look for sectors, here's wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: XPF, XPF plus SOG, and just SOG by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is suggesting that SOG-1 is really
important for minimizing heritable DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: damage induced by ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can control chromosomal stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this by inhibiting progression of
the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't showed you all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It switches cells from a mitotic to
endorheic duplicative cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as long as you are not doing
cell division, double cell breaks are not
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it induces cell death in dividing
meristematic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the isolation of mutants
defective in these responses indicates
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're programmed responses rather
than toxic effects of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Karu Yoshiyama was postdoc
in the lab, and she mapped SOG and figured
[SPEAKER_00]: out what gene it was, and it turned out to
be a transcription factor, a NAC domain
[SPEAKER_00]: family protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a single amino acid change from a
glycine that's entirely conserved in all
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 NAC domain proteins and rabidopsis to
an arginine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like, unfortunately,
we would love to be able to go to NIH and
[SPEAKER_00]: say we're going to look for SOG mutants in
humans or something, but this NAC domain
[SPEAKER_00]: family does not exist outside the plant
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it only exists in land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to really go out on a limb,
I could say that you couldn't become a
[SPEAKER_00]: land plant without SOG because it's
important for response to desiccation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, anyway, you can find homologs of SOG
as opposed to other NAC domain proteins in
[SPEAKER_00]: related angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have more closely related genes to
SOG than to the next NAC domain protein in
[SPEAKER_00]: a rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they probably are all carrying this
response, but it hasn't been shown at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, SOG itself is not transcriptionally
induced by ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense for the master
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be at the top of the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be present to detect the DNA
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does it do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, damage sensors are conserved among
eukaryotes, and there are two classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes they trade off some
functions, but you can distinguish between
[SPEAKER_00]: them pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ATM, which detects double-strand
breaks directly with the help of other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, and there's ATR, which slightly
indirectly detects persisting
[SPEAKER_00]: single-stranded stretches of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not single-strand breaks, but
single-stranded DNAs uses these factors to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these sort of touch the lesion
before becoming activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is in mammals, there's a check
one and check two kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These don't exist in plants at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants have the detectors, don't
necessarily have the same connections,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you get down to the regulation of
the cell cycle itself, of course they do
[SPEAKER_00]: share some factors, and we won as one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so for instance, this gamma
plantlet formation, which these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: irradiated seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's resistant to radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's XPF making a lovely gamma plantlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's XPF SOG making these sort of
crappy-looking true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at ATM, ATM still has the
arrest, so ATM's not required for that
[SPEAKER_00]: arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at ATR, we get the true leaves
back again, and they look a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: than SOG, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ATR is apparently detecting whatever
lesion it is that XPF is leaving behind in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATM's not required for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATR is absolutely required, and in fact,
we won, is also required for the
[SPEAKER_00]: detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably some kind of
replication block, and we won as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so SOG-1 is a transcription factor,
so does Arabidopsis have a transcriptional
[SPEAKER_00]: response to ionizing radiation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this experiment is to take
five-day-old seedlings, irradiate not
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, but seedlings, with 100 grays,
which is a dose that slows them down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, but then they all can recover from
that dose, and look at the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptome at 1.5, 3, 6, 12,
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is presented on a timeline across
here, and the red bars are genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: repressed, and green bars are genes that
are, I'm sorry, red is induced,
[SPEAKER_00]: and green is repressed, and this has been
sorted by the computer into similar
[SPEAKER_00]: expression patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are hundreds of genes that are
induced, and peak between about one and
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also hundreds of genes that are
suppressed, and that maximum suppression
[SPEAKER_00]: is about at nine, nope, sorry,
six hours, six hours, and these include
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts that promote cell cycle
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this little cluster of
genes that are induced at 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so is this a response to double
serum breaks, or is this a response to
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to other cellular components?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the list of genes that are
induced, the most highly induced genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are all on Gaffey chips,
and the fold induction for genes like
[SPEAKER_00]: BRCA1, which are extremely repressed under
normal conditions in the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: is highly variable when you do the
experiment, depending on how you process
[SPEAKER_00]: the data from the chips, and where you
draw the line about background levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that this is really
induced 581 fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not two to the 581,
we're just talking about 581 fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you look at this,
you can see wild type is inducing these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes to these degrees, and if you look at
the list of genes, and you happen to know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about DNA metabolism,
you can see that they're all DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ATR mutation has no effect on
the induction of those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATM is critical for the induction of these
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time point, in response to
gamma radiation, ATM is driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: induction of this cluster, this little red
cluster of genes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if we then go ahead and
expose the ATM mutant, you can see that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of this response is still going on,
but not this cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ATM, that's the double strand break
response, because ATM is a double strand
[SPEAKER_00]: break detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we're still getting
repression of the cell cycle, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we look at gene by gene basis,
ATM and ATR both play semi-redundant roles
[SPEAKER_00]: in that response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is ATR driven in an ATM
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what about SOG?
[SPEAKER_00]: SOG's a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it regulate in this response?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Kauru found is that it regulates
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this little cluster, again,
of genes, SOG1 is essential for its
[SPEAKER_00]: induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SOG1 must be a transcription factor
that doesn't bind to every one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters, but perhaps binds to the
promoters of transcription factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: then bind to the promoter of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SOG1 is remarkably important for this
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and how does SOG1 work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kauru had a paper published recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went on to work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: SOG1 has, we knew that it had an SQ motif,
a couple of them that were highly
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted to be regulated by both ATM and
ATR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what our model is, is ATM is induced by
a double strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes an active kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it activates the activity of
pre-existing SOG1 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes on to induce other effects
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and again, if you're interested,
you can see Kauru's paper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we talked a little bit
before about what relevance does ionizing
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation have for plant biology at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously plants have a lovely
programmed response to it, but it's never
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that DNA repair people like
to say in the literature is, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: any conventional stress induces reactive
oxygen species, and that induces DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably important for
response to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you actually use this DNA damage
response as an indicator for the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of double strand breaks, we could say,
if we look at other stresses, do we see
[SPEAKER_00]: the induction of this response at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's with gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another kind of ionizing radiation
HCE.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the ATM mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a particularly nice diagnostic
cluster of transcripts that are ATM
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we unmask all this and look at some
other stresses, salt, osmotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: drought, cold, heat, blah, blah,
blah, blah, we're not seeing these
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we've clustered expressions
based just on gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've extended that analysis to
look at other stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a nice block here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is genotoxic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a combination of MMS and mitomycin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just a DNA repair
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroxyurea is an inhibitor of DNA
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see a little there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at these more generic
stresses, you know, if you squint,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see it in salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the roots as opposed to the
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is UVB.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it a little there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the go category,
and we've already discussed this a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: of these ATM dependent gamma induced
genes, it's massively overrepresented for
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA and DNA metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we, again, look through all these
stresses and just take the RNA and DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism genes that we really understand
and look really hard for their induction
[SPEAKER_00]: by generic stress, we don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this response is not there to deal with
generic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be there to deal with seed storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just what I told you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, it's not even induced by
Paraquat, which is specifically a ROS
[SPEAKER_00]: inducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's different between Paraquat and
RNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Paraquat is producing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, ionizing radiation is producing
clusters of ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of energy deposited in a very
small area is very high, and you damage
[SPEAKER_00]: both strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal ROS just doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage is single bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happens all the times in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very, very good at coping
using excision repair to repair single
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So desiccation tolerance and radiation
tolerance seem to be two sides of the same
coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a famous organism that's
extremely radiation resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was found that it's also extremely
desiccation resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutants that are sensitive to IR are also
sensitive to dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the transcriptomics,
the two stresses induce the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dehydration, indeed, induces massive
amounts of breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dehydration-rehydration cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris West and Wanda Waller Wurth have
done some research on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have shown that as the plant,
as the rabidopsis seed is germinating,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a one or two hour window during
imbibition at which you see the induction
[SPEAKER_00]: of this response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes away again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to really take thin slices of
time to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've also shown DNA lag is what is
important for seed longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that probably is what this really
elaborate response is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize so far, I'm not going to
get all the way through this talk for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the immediate actual
response to double-strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rabidopsis has a robust, very
reproducible transcriptional response to
[SPEAKER_00]: IR, which is governed by ATM and SOC 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transcriptional response to IR is
important in mammals and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: P53 is a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is nowhere near this amplitude or
this reproducibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transcription scramps induced early
after IR are DSB specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that a rabidopsis induces
a programmed cell death response that is
[SPEAKER_00]: also ATM and SOC 1 dependent to both UV,
which I didn't discuss, and ionizing
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is focused largely in the
precursor cells of the steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that different cells respond in
different ways to gamma radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can ask, is the short-term
transcriptional response different in
[SPEAKER_00]: different cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this requires the presence of SOC 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: SOC 1 is a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cross our fingers and hope that
these cells have a different
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional response than these cells
around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could do the transcriptomics of
just these cells, it might give us a clue
[SPEAKER_00]: as to some of the connecting dots between
the double-strand breaks and the induction
[SPEAKER_00]: of cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as an example of the cell type
specificity of DNA damage response,
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil made this construct of a BRCA1
promoter fused to luciferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's going to do is going to take
this same plate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to collect 20-minute batches of
photons for nine hours after radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is the exact same plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are these plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cotyledons are dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you watch this and we'll cycle
through it several times, you might check
[SPEAKER_00]: out the root tip first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can look farther up to see
what's going on next time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this flare has come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's starting to disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something particularly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these evenly spaced spots of BRCA1
induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're coming around again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look higher up, we can see the root
tips of the lateral roots lighting up
[SPEAKER_00]: later than the root tip down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more time, we can also see,
at this time point, evenly spaced white
[SPEAKER_00]: spots within the root, which are probably
the areas where the lateral roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come out and emerge later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear to me that those cells are
dividing already, but they know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're mirror-stamped already.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in the case of BRCA1, we can
clearly see that timing is different for
[SPEAKER_00]: different cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some cells never express BRCA1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some cells express it more strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots in the highly mitotic new
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less in the already developed
cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of BRCA1, we'll probably
see induction only in cells that undergo
[SPEAKER_00]: or can undergo or are undergoing DNA
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because BRCA1 is involved in homologous
repair of double-strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that occurs during S phase in G2,
because it uses the sister chromatid as a
[SPEAKER_00]: template to repair the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process, at least in mammals,
is very cell cycle regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's absolutely suppressed in G1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Phil went on to ask, does the quality
of the transcriptional response vary with
[SPEAKER_00]: cell type?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was all about quantity and timing
for one cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go ahead and do the
transcriptomics for a particular cell
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cell type-specific transcriptomics can
tell us lots of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help us identify first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcripts that we would never have seen
on a whole ground-up seedling,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're only being induced,
say, in four cells that you're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do a lot of work
to isolate those four cells and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suddenly that signal will stand out,
and you wouldn't have seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Phil's not looking at just four cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking at a whole batch of cells
that turned out to be about 5% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: total cells of the root tips that he's
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify candidate genes for
regulators of the effectors of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell type-specific processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the goal that we're really
looking for in this kind of experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to identify new regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at Go analysis can
provide clues as to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so again, we're going to attempt to
isolate these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do this perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're going to use is a
P-wooden-leg DFP fusion that labels these,
[SPEAKER_00]: really the dividing steel cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are still undergoing
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing, we didn't have a lot of
money, so we didn't do a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil chose something between four hours,
at which he could see no cell death,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six hours, at which he could,
after radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his protocol is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking the DFP-positive line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting off just the root tips and
throwing away the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to protoplast the root
tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to self-sort away the GFP-plus
and collect this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 5% of this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Phil did not sort away what we're
drawing here as red versus green.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just took the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're comparing GFP-plus to the entire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show that the sort worked,
short root is the transcript that should
[SPEAKER_00]: only be expressed in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it's enhanced for
expression of short root, whereas actin is
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed through out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that if you take the
entire root tip versus the GFP-positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are pretty much the same,
but short root is enriched here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sort worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to go through this really
quickly, this is, he's doing his RNA-seq
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this is gibberish to me,
but I trust my people in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do the go analysis of these genes
that are induced in both tissues equally,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see is this gamma response that we
discussed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response to double strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is happening in the outer shell
and in the inner core of the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are responding to double
strand breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just telling you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repressed in both tissues is the cell
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these things about building new
cells is being shut down temporarily while
[SPEAKER_00]: the root tip is responding to the 100
degrees of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at genes that are induced more
strongly in the GFP-plus, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're doing the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at these go categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these go categories are
somewhat redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same genes may be falling into
multiple go categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all have to do with immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as plant biologists, I'm sure you're
sensitive with a hypersensitive response
[SPEAKER_00]: to pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is suggesting that there are
commonalities between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the detection is different,
but it may be that the cell death itself
[SPEAKER_00]: is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the connection somewhere, those two
processes meet up into the same signal
[SPEAKER_00]: transduction chain, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing a similar effect,
again, induced specifically in the
[SPEAKER_00]: population that's going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just showing you the relative
fold induction in GFP-plus versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Phil took a couple of these genes,
made GFP fusions, transformed them into
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and he can get some very pretty
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without ionizing radiation, this is a
senescence-associated gene, 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look carefully and you know your
root tip morphology, you see that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: not part of the steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we're purifying cells in
the steel, this is also induced outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is induced right here in the root
tip, and it's very IR-inducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of expression within the
steel going up, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we told you that the cell
type-specific transcriptomics can identify
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts from suspected cell types
whose signals are normally swamped,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's another interesting result that
Phil got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a gene called IRF115,
which is very hard to detect because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very poorly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sees it as being induced in his
GFP-plus population by IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the function of IRF115?
[SPEAKER_00]: The function of this gene, even de
Velder's lab had this paper in Science,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015, IRF115, if it's over-expressed,
causes the cells in the QC, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sort of organizing core of the root
tip, to divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stimulates division of the QC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting that at a time in
which cell division is being actively
[SPEAKER_00]: repressed in the root tip, this
stimulating gene that's specific for the
[SPEAKER_00]: QC is being induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Phil and I are still arguing about
this, but I believe we're also seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: induction of WAX5, which is another
QC-specific transcript that suppresses
[SPEAKER_00]: division of cells in the QC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we're seeing is induction
of QC identity in tissues where it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the other thing we promised you
was that we could identify candidate genes
[SPEAKER_00]: for regulators or effectors of cell
cycle-specific processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where our story gets a little
bit sad, because we're just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Phil took 15 different homozygous
exonic insertion lines, representing 10 of
[SPEAKER_00]: these IR-induced transcripts, and none of
them were mutant for PCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Program cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took seven exonic insertion lines,
representing seven repressed transcripts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and none of them were mutant for PCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he just got a little desperate,
and he took 11 genes that govern,
[SPEAKER_00]: already known to govern hypersensitive
response, and none of them were mutant for
[SPEAKER_00]: PCD either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we need to look more
carefully at this, but no one's
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly motivated to, because this is
a rather depressing result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusions for part two,
and I don't think I can go on to part
[SPEAKER_00]: three, but I do want to show you just one
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots can recover from massive doses of
IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an early result, so I haven't
discussed this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcriptional response is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go into this, talking
about day one a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is things that happen after day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the root tip undergoes cell death in
this programmed way at later time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root is going to have to recover,
because it will, at this dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: recover and go on with growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As plant biologists, you're familiar with
the QC, which is a population of about
[SPEAKER_00]: four cells that basically provide identity
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a DNA repair and recovery person,
I have always thought of the QC as a
[SPEAKER_00]: population of cells that is intentionally
never dividing, so that it never has
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with DNA damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not undergoing replication,
making replication errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cycling, so it's not so sensitive
to double-stone breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's there to replace these cells,
which are foolish enough to be dividing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great reason to have a
quiescent center.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm seeing when I look at the
expression of QC identity after radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me think that perhaps this is
incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to move on with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at a wild-type plant,
we give it 150 grays of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We watch the root growth over the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still growth during the period
after radiation, because most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to supply new cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run out of new cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: By then, the meristem starts growing
again, and you get root growth again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a SOG mutant at this dose,
the SOG mutant actually stops growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SOG is doing something that's important
for recovery of the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours after 150 grays, you can see that
wild-type has experienced a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this particular dose, this particular
experiment, we can still see the QC in
[SPEAKER_00]: these root tips not getting cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the complemented line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a control to show you that's really a
SOG-1 dependent effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look three days after 150 gray,
we're starting to get elongation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells as the differentiation zone proceeds
down towards the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can no longer see the QC in wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this structure is getting messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks nice and organized in SOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put them on constitutive rather
than an acute DNA-damaging agent,
[SPEAKER_00]: SOG looks lovely compared with wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it maintains its root shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this complemented line,
the QC is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look five days after, we can still
see the QC in SOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only see a mess in these root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, seven days after, the situation
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root tip has recovered in wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reestablished and has grown away from
all that big fat cell crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root tip is now growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And differentiation has proceeded all the
way down to the tip in SOG, and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in their stem anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you look at the growth
day after day, both of these things keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, and then they slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they finally stop growing,
they produce a lot of root hairs at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves what we call a scar,
so you can tell where they stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as the days go on, a new
meristem will be formed in wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to reorganize itself, and then it
will grow away from all of this mess,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you this growth curve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, if you look at expression
of WACS-5, which is a QC-specific gene
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript, what you see is that as the
days proceed, after radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: in wild-type, and we haven't looked at SOG
yet because we don't have the line yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: WACS-5 expression spreads throughout the
root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's as if all of these cells are
volunteering for the position of new QC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when this root tip finally re-emerges,
you're back to having WACS-5 expression
[SPEAKER_00]: only in those four cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, somehow, the QC is selecting among all
these potentially crappy cells to find,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps, a really good one that is going
to make up the new QC, which is a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch, but that's what they seem to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I should just move on to thank
the people responsible for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you may have met Phil Conklin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's moved here to Mike Scanlon Lab just
recently, and he and Victor were
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for a lot of the
transcriptomics analysis, but filled it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the wet lab-type experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to thank the rest of my
lab, who's doing other projects and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you can ask me about,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, I'd like to thank the
students again for inviting me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
