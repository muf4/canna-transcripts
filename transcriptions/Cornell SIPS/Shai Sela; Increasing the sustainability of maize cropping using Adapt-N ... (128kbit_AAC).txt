[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the outline for the talk today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a little bit of
background on what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture-related environmental
pollution and the complexity of estimating
[SPEAKER_00]: the right fertilizer end rates for a
particular field, basically the background
[SPEAKER_00]: of why the adaptive tool was developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the tool,
discuss its calibration, its validation
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, and I will end with a few
applications of Adapt N and new
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental policies that we're now
promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Green Revolution, the beginning of the
century, really enabled an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: crop production, and it came with a price.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of environmental concerns
related to nitrogen leaching from
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture production.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the production of the
fertilizer is very energy-costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One percent of all the energy in the world
is now devoted into producing nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has groundwater issues, greenhouse gas,
and also some health issues related to air
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, there's a lot of environmental
concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you all heard of the dead
zone, what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every summer, inputs of nutrients from
upstream lead to hypoxia in the Gulf of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, last year or last summer was the
largest dead zone ever recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: In spite of many efforts that has been
done, it's really hard to show progress in
[SPEAKER_00]: this respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surprising that the intensity of
the production upstream is overwhelming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is the land cover map.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow are corn fields, and green is
the soy field, soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is USDA data, and just the immense
intensity of this system is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to maybe give a few words about
what is currently being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rainfall for a location in Iowa,
from Des Moines, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the month of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, corn is planted at May,
harvested about in the fall, in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty percent of all U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: corn growers actually apply their
fertilizer in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logistically, it's not much easier for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The season is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have time to go in and fertilize,
but it's very inefficient to fertilize
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe eight months before the crop
actually needs it in the next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of end losses and basically
inefficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 60 percent of farmers apply it in
the spring as a pre-plant in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is better than a fall pre-plant,
but still relatively, or there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: time difference between when the pre-plant
is made and the actual crop uptake in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 30 percent or so apply in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the more advanced way of actually
supplying your fertilizer close to when
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more efficient, and it adds up to
more than 100 percent, because some
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers apply twice, both in the fall and
in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: When farmers need to make decisions about
their fertilizer end rate, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of uncertainty involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EONR, or the optimum end rate,
is very hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a risk of, if you over-fertilize,
there's actually lower risk than
[SPEAKER_00]: under-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads farmers or many farmers to
over-apply fertilizer just to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not end-efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no deficiency of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to actually get or
understand what is the right end rate to a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular field, because soil nitrogen is
so dynamic and so valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has many losses, pathway, and many
sources of end inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's organic matter which goes,
mineralization in the field, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation going on in every location
in a field, and changes in time and in
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to understand how much soil
you really have in your field,
[SPEAKER_00]: of how much nitrogen you have in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer industry has been promoting
what they call the four-hour concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically that farmers should supply
their fertilizer in the right source,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right rate, the right time,
and the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four hours of nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a concept, this is a good concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really advance farmers into better
manage their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's very hard to implement this
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the right rate for a specific
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the right source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it depending on the rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it depending on the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these hours basically interact with
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers have very difficult times in
implementing a full four-hour approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last few months, we've been
developing this concept for model of how
[SPEAKER_00]: an end rate, a dynamic way to estimate
nitrogen and fertilizer rates should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each field, the farmer have its
resources, the soil type, soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: the condition of the field, the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are factors which the farmer
actually control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hybrid, use of cover crops,
yes or no, what are the tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you need to make a decision about
your end rate, you need to know the other
[SPEAKER_00]: four or three hours, the source,
the placement, and the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the whole field is subjected to
weather, the effect of weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation, temperature, solar
radiation, all these things that drive the
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation of nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these factors basically continuously
interact in space and in time to decide or
[SPEAKER_00]: to affect the soil and crop end in any
given moment in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use external inputs like remote
sensing, like soil test to help and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically validate or correct your
estimation of what soil end and crop end
[SPEAKER_00]: in your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you have a good sense of the soil
end and crop end, you need to account for
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: What yield are you expecting in your
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the potential of that specific
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the economics?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did you pay for your grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you get for your grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you pay for your fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, you can estimate the right end
rate for a specific location.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, of course, very challenging and
we believe that modeling is a way forward
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you want to develop a model,
the way you do it, basically you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of field data which then need to
calibrate your model and then validate
[SPEAKER_00]: your model.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with the validation,
you move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you go back and you repeatedly
collect more data, calibrate, and
[SPEAKER_00]: validate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, you need to have an
independent model evaluation after you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel it's validated enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ADAPT-N tool uses the precision
nitrogen management model, the PNN.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a model developed here at Cornell by
Jeff M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malkonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a combination of two different
models, a soil chemistry model,
[SPEAKER_00]: leach-N, and a crop growth model,
model of Sinclair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leach-N does the hydrology and the
biogeochemistry of the soil, the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, the transformation of carbon and
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in turn affects the crop or the
growth of a crop, which in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: maize, to give a holistic approach to
modeling the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need data to validate the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were lucky here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was before my time, of course,
but Cornell was lucky to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: Willsboro Lysometer plots farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a farm close to Lake Champlain,
near Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a farm where you have a
difference in soil textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has installed this extensive
Lysometer plots which allow to test
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And collect the drainage and the leaching,
and then allow extensive testing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PNN was validated using this farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a few of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go quickly on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for nitrate and leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically a good agreement between
simulated and measured nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil nitrate or the leached nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another experiment where they had
a manure application which adds complexity
[SPEAKER_00]: to the model, but still the PNN simulated
quite nicely with a good agreement between
[SPEAKER_00]: the measured data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model was also validated for other
components like crop N or the yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall the model does a good job in
predicting the different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the background, or the PNN
was one of the main, once the model was
[SPEAKER_00]: validated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 2000s they came to the
understanding that it could be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict soil or the nitrogen dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how ADAPT-N was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is ADAPT-N?
[SPEAKER_00]: ADAPT-N is a decision support tool to help
farmer estimate their soil N in complex
[SPEAKER_00]: production environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it effectively addresses multiple
environmental issues of water quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gaseous losses, greenhouse gas,
or ammonia emission, and the energy costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADAPT-N was developed as a public-private
partnership with a company called ATC,
[SPEAKER_00]: Agronomic Technology Corporation,
a startup company which had the license to
[SPEAKER_00]: the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was commercialized in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few months ago ATC was acquired by
Yara.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know, Yara
International is the world's largest
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer production company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in 160 countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw the potential in the tool,
and they will invest further and coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're developing the tool through other
crops and other locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is maybe the time to just
disclose that Yara supports some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research of ADAPT-N here at this,
in Howard's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what is the features of ADAPT-N?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not go into all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just quickly go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very flexible tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows to have multiple soil inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on a daily time step, daily time
step resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: High resolution of climate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a six hour lag, almost real time of
climate data, and four by four kilometers
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution in space or spatial resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opa, sorry, very flexible in terms of
management inputs of the tillage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer input.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be either inorganic or organic,
like manure or cover crops, and many
[SPEAKER_00]: different practices which are actually
being done on real fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very importantly, it allows input from
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the farmer has measurements of soil
N, it can add it to the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the model corrects the estimates
according to the observations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does ADAPT-N recommend N rates or
what's the ADAPT-N approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dynamic mass balance approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it means that the nitrogen
accommodation is dependent on the expected
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower needs to supply what is a
reasonable yield for that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the model accounts for how much
is already in the crop and how much is
[SPEAKER_00]: already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two components are simulated by
the PNN model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it accounts for the previous crop
credits, for example soybean, and future
[SPEAKER_00]: gains for mineralization for that soil
type, for that location, or losses through
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another profit risk factor that
accounts for the prices of grain and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be run either on a whole field,
it could be run on a zone, it could be run
[SPEAKER_00]: in a fully graded VRP, a high resolution
variable rate, a prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: very flexible and accommodating real-life
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tool was independently validated now
in many studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just show a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study that we had published two
years ago in Agronomy Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used strip trial data from 113 trials
in New York and in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in each trial, we had either a rate
recommended by ADAPT-N using our adaptive
[SPEAKER_00]: approach or by the grower selected rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the results just to quickly
walk you through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the grower rate, ADAPT-N rate,
and this is the one to one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the data is higher or above this
line, it's either the grower rate is
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than the respective ADAPT-N rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that in 83% of the
old trials, ADAPT-N actually allowed a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite significant, 45 kilograms per
hectare, close to 35% reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just note that there was few instances,
few cases where ADAPT-N actually
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended higher N rates than the grower
in the wetter season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not only reducing,
it's about adjusting the right N rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the specific location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So practically, there is no difference in
yields between the dynamic approach and
[SPEAKER_00]: the static or basically the grower
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means that the 34% or 35% of
additional nitrogen supplied by grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually reduce that without
reducing your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the yield is, if you look at
the difference, it's not significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is higher for ADAPT-N because there
are cases, like I said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: where ADAPT-N recommended more nitrogen
that led to much higher yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you reduce your N inputs
and you don't reduce your yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: you increase your profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ADAPT-N leads to an increase of $65
per hectare, which is a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just proved that it could be a
win-win situation and you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: apply less nitrogen and still make it more
profitable for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the environmental losses?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is simulated losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not measured in all of those
hundreds of trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an average reduction of 36% in leaching
losses and close to 40% in gaseous losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also a large environmental
benefit in using a tool like ADAPT-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many tools that are promoted
for US corn production which are static,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning they, for the same season,
they recommend the same N rate regardless
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seasonal weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for New York, one such tool is the
corn N calculator, which is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: CNC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tool that was originally developed
here at this department maybe 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, it's the tool that's
been promoted for farmers in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to compare our adaptive
approach to this static tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it using multiple N rate
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trials where you have multiple
N rates where you collect the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it allows you to construct this
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually calculate the optimum
N rate for specific season, for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, of course, a perfect
hindsight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, in the end of the season,
you know what, in hindsight, was the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum N rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allows to then take different tools
like ADAPT-N or like the CNC and compare
[SPEAKER_00]: them using this data and see how do they
perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few words about the CNC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a static tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's a factor which multiplies
by the yield and some correction for the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And efficiency of drainage in a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compare it to that ADAPT-N tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of the tools rely on yield input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left here, what you can see that
this is the achieved yield in the trials
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the yields that were estimated by
the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that growers have a very good
sense of what's the potential of their
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remarkable, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three bushels per acre difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use the actual default yields
in the database of the CNC, we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: it underestimates the yield that we're
measuring in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite largely in about 60 bushels per
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use these default yields
which come with the CNC database,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you use that to generate a
recommendation, this is the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the optimum N rate measured in
each field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for the default yield of the
CNC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we found it to be under the
optimum N rate because you have a low
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation of the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that drives a low recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below the EONR or the optimum N rate,
40 pounds below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take the measured yield or the
estimated yields, that's by the farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you plug it into the calculator,
we found that it's actually overestimates
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, the EONR by close to 80 pounds
per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just about correcting the
yield input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we compare ADAPT-N to the EONR,
we found practically a better performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an average six pounds below the
optimum N rate, which is quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just remember that these decisions
regarding the N rates are made in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what will actually be or
what will occur as the season progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tool was able to, when the EONR
was low, the tool recommended lower N
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the EONR is higher, the tool
recommended more N rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, a nice correlation between N
rates and the measured optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this basically just supports that our
adaptive approach performs better than a
[SPEAKER_00]: static approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ADAPT-N competed in the Tulay nitrogen
reduction challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge which initiated by Tulane
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically called for teams from
around the world to submit their solution
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the nitrogen leaching from
agricultural production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 77 teams applied their solution from
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a two and a half year process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a committee of 16 experts reviewed
each tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were finalists that were invited
to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tools on real production
environments and real farms in Louisiana
[SPEAKER_00]: and demonstrate the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a month ago, two months ago,
we were invited to New Orleans where we
[SPEAKER_00]: were told that ADAPT-N won the
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of 77 teams, the committee found
our solution to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a nice prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Associated with that, that would go into
further development of the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that, it's the recognition
that other people also see the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: of our tools, of the potential of this
approach of dynamically estimating N
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, of course, very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the few minutes that I have,
I want to just present how we use ADAPT-N
[SPEAKER_00]: in environmental policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are large companies like
Walmart, but not only Walmart,
[SPEAKER_00]: large retail companies that want to reduce
their carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Walmart, for example, came to the
conclusion that fertilizer accounts for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 50% of their carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking to ways to basically
track the sustainability of the production
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they can improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, in a paper just recently accepted
to Bioscience, we think that an index
[SPEAKER_00]: called the N surplus or N balance is a
suitable index for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very nice paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freely available in the Bioscience
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is N surplus?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's N inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either by fertilizer or by manure or
organic, other organic, minus the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of N which is removed by the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's left behind, the surplus,
this is the index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many studies now that find
that N surplus, when you increase N
[SPEAKER_00]: surplus, in the first stage, you have no
increase in your yield scale losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the fertilizer you add
translate into higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not lost to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a threshold in N surplus
where further increase really drives
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental losses increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that you can use this N
surplus index to track or to better track
[SPEAKER_00]: the sustainability of your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will show that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We explored this in the Bioscience paper
using synthetic simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had five states in the five biggest
corn production states in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three scenarios, fall pre-plant,
where most of the corn, most of that
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer is applied in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring pre-plant, where most of the
fertilizer is applied in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a split application where you have a
modest starter in the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the fertilizer is applied in
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always use the adapt N to check if
there is any N deficiencies expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there was, we added more N.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eliminated any inefficiencies in all
of our scenarios, all of our simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that there's a nice relationship
between N surplus and yield scale N losses
[SPEAKER_00]: for our Midwest location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also found that fall
application here in the Bioscience blue
[SPEAKER_00]: has a mean value of 175 kilogram N surplus
value of 175 kilogram per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you shift your application to the
spring, the green here, you immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce it quite substantially to 125
kilogram per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you reduce it or you shift it
further into the season, you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have a mean value of close to 30 kilograms
per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of improvement that can
be done by shifting the timing of your
[SPEAKER_00]: management into in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to further explore what else
can growers do to reduce their N surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did, I used field data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is experimental data, 127 trials
that we had in seven US states.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every trial, we had either a rate
recommended by adapt N, a dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, versus a static approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that N surplus is
also, of course, related to the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: scale losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more noisier than our simulation
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we add here the bin data,
you can see that it starts to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: actually at about 75 kilograms per hectare
of N surplus value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to really get a more
quantitative estimation of this threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did regressions, a hockey stick
function, where basically there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: segment which is straight, which is
connected to a linear increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inflection point where N losses
begin to increase with N surplus is
[SPEAKER_00]: optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found that we did it two times,
first to the adaptive data set and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: static data set separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found at about 48 kilograms
per hectare, about 50, is a region where N
[SPEAKER_00]: losses really begin to increase in our
experimental sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're taking this threshold and we
went back to the data and compared the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the 48 kilogram of N surplus
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another value from the literature,
78 kilograms, from a paper by Zhang two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit larger, so it's a more relaxed
N surplus upper limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cumulative distribution of our
experimental data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you use a static approach,
only about 15% of the time you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually meet that target of the 50 or 48
kilograms per hectare of N surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use an adaptive approach,
you have three times more likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: within that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close to 50% of the time you are
within that limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this got us thinking, because if using
a tool like Adapt N, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more advanced tools out there,
even using a tool like Adapt N,
[SPEAKER_00]: only 50% of the time farmers are able to
meet those regions of N surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where N losses begin to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a realistic value to expect for
farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you now want to go and tell farmers to
improve their management, you have to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a realistic set of values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we extended the bioscience simulation
to include more soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to the bioscience approach
simulation, we always supplied enough N to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate N deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for a sandy loam, coarse soil in a
dry location like Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you use a full application
without inhibitors, you have about 30% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time you're within the region or the
48 kilogram, let's say, target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding inhibitors improves the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring more cases into that region
for a spring application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further improvement, adding inhibitors to
a spring application, still another
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real improvement goes or happens
when you move into the street application
[SPEAKER_00]: and go in-season and just supply
fertilizer closer to when the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: actually needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, just by shifting your
management into in-season, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible to match those targets if you're
in a dry location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens if you're in a much
wetter location like Indiana?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is fall application without
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fall application with inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great improvement, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's just way off the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spring without inhibitors and spring
with inhibitors, better than the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still a lot of the times you're not
within the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're within the target region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do the split application,
it's of course the largest improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, 60% of the time, you can't make
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's very hard for farmers to actually
be within that region, the target region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else can they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the options for greater
efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, farmers can, there could be
a trade-off between the farmer's profits
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environmental aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a modest yield reduction by not
basically pressing the system so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next slide, I will present that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have further optimization by
multiple application throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, they have high clearance equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers can actually go two, three times
within the season and almost spoon feed
[SPEAKER_00]: their crop with the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a much more efficient way of supplying
your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have a greater use of cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our simulations here, we found in many
cases, there were a lot of residual N in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil in the end of the simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is here highlighted in the red
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red is cases where the residual
soil N is greater than 50 kilograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's quite a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, it's where the simulated
yield losses are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just usually soil N in the end
of the season is prone to be lost during
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter, during the early spring of the
next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can apply cover crops that can
actually consume and use this residual
[SPEAKER_00]: soil N.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to go back again,
this is the response curve of the N rate
[SPEAKER_00]: and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from 16 trials that we had in
Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black line is the mean value of
all these experimental sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green line is the optimum N rate
calculated for this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you approach the high N rates,
the increase in yield, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's less efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get less yield per nitrogen that
you apply when you go to the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you reduce just five
bushels from that optimum N rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 2% of your yield,
you reduce 16% of your N inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you reduce 10 bushels, which is still
only 5% reduction in yields, you reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 30% of N inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we are now
exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be translated into reduction in N
surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the five bushels reduction in yield is
actually 30 kilograms per hectare
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in N losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers, of course, will need to
be compensated for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making less profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the compensation would be about $20 per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you reduce 10 bushels, it's about 50 or
45 kilograms of N surplus reduction and
[SPEAKER_00]: about $60 compensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that you can now go into
those locations where it's actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: prone to losses and just maybe help shift
the trials back into the region by not
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing the system so much and
compensating the farmers for their yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make sure that the farmers
are not losing their profit loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so a few take-home messages from this
seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADAPT-N allows reduction of N application
without reduction of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just proves that there could be a
win-win situation where the farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: increases its profits and there's less
environmental pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a dynamic approach to be much
better than a static approach in
[SPEAKER_00]: estimating N rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it leads to higher profitability and
lower environmental pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a tool like ADAPT-N could be used to
set standards of what is achievable N-use
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency or N surplus values for
different production environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then policymakers can use these
standards and think, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: What practices can we promote that will
help achieve those standards or achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: those targets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps they can shift the production
environment into a more sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people collaborated and helped,
of course, along the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Harold, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Peter and many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a lot of funding helped
along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be happy to answer questions if
you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you talk about inhibitor,
do you mean the nitrification inhibitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we have ADAPT-N can simulate
multiple either nitropyrene, like
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrification inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a dual mode, like a URIZ inhibitor and
a nitrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many inhibitors we do simulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data that I've presented is from
nitropyrene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a nitrification inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you're doing your N equation,
N in soil, that would be integrated N.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have another figure that is N
expected in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that data comes from the region
portion of the model that has some,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, microbial cycling in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how you're accounting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each site, we have in the
estimation of N rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you ADAPT-N recommend the N rate,
so it's true that you have the simulated
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crop in an N by the PNN.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a component that accounts for
future mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's depending on the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the site specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's based on long-term simulations
for a similar soil type in a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an expected contribution from
mineralization for that soil type in that
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
Question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your plans for the field
experiments in the coming season?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the coming season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard is here to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of in a transition period.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel like we've done a lot of
validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly in New York, we have five,
six years of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same in Iowa and Indiana and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, because Yara International
acquired the license, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: initiating discussions with them of where
they want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel like for most of the U.S.,
we're in pretty good shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably going to be looking more at
the technology.
And then Yara, of course, wants to expand
to other countries.
So they actually have a list of where they
want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to develop soil-based data.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably where we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in a way, it's been a
multi-multi-year effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're also continuing this on the
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil type, the soil inputs are
according for or are depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't really calibrate the model
for everywhere you apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been calibrated quite extensively in
the Midwest and in the Northeast and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid-Atlantic and North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have better data for that
location through a calibration study,
[SPEAKER_00]: we improve the coefficients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, correct me if I'm wrong,
there's a default coefficient depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil type and organic matter and USDA
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses a lot of site-specific
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have soil database in about that are
related to different regions and
countries.
And we're bringing in the brethren that's
also appropriate.
But it's in a way an interesting issue
that we have because of the lane challenge
that the industry reviews technology
through our submission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had to prove the technology on
a part of Moxley, India, and North
[SPEAKER_02]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though we had the model
available for that week, we hadn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get one shot to do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were very happy with the way it
came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The model did very well under those
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's robust enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can deal with different geographies,
certainly in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second question is about the split
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have the weather information in
your model.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very hard, even a whole article,
for weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you run your simulation,
what kind of weather volatility do you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel for your adaptation?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so a forecast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the components that use the historical
simulation, like the losses, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: component here, the future mineralization,
also temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to predict what will be
soil temperature in three months from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's based on long-term simulation of
historical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there is a feature that the
company is working on where there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: a short-term forecast, not months,
probably a few days or maybe a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will allow to also account for
the new weather forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is a rainfall or some future
immediate losses, which are expected and
[SPEAKER_00]: so the end rate will be corrected to
account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a feature that they're working
on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not currently implemented in the
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you use the weather data in the next
two weeks, then your prediction,
[SPEAKER_03]: it might be OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're talking for the field by the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we do account for that by those
historical simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you do, I don't know, 20 or 30
years of simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get an expected season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or with uncertainty, you can account for
that uncertainty or correct your
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's historical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a source of uncertainty in model
prediction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.
So this is in regards to some of the work
you've shown about plan for the targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is, within the week, maybe turn
five in a period where there's been a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of interest in cooperating with a
headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model accounts for the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower needs to, there's a long list
of hybrids that the farmer needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically supply, which one is being used
on that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the parameters are tuned for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Jeff can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there are some that are very,
very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, seed companies have not
made that a priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not aware that they have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, there are situations where it
would be very valuable to have hyperdepth
[SPEAKER_02]: to pick up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that could give us more
information about the genetics that would
[SPEAKER_02]: allow us better simulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not, other than maturity data,
there's a lot.
There's not much to turn on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to compliment the research team.
Because by the time we got them validated,
what did we find from getting the fact
that the model in that state was
contributing to the development of science
to state health performance.
But I think we've come home.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add to that, thank you very
much for that, Kerry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add that if we stand on the
shoulders of communities like ours,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still here, or no one is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in that respect, I think we
can still be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very grateful for what others have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more questions?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
