[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today I am going to be talking about my
work on genomics of insect and nematode
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I would start out broadly
just introducing the where do we find
[SPEAKER_03]: insect pathogens in the fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's really two and two,
three, or three major groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: The orbeliales, which are these are these
are Ascomycete fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a phylogeny of the Ascomycota.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the orbeliales, we have a lot of
nematode trapping fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are these organisms that live in
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're infamous for forming these lassoes
that capture and actively trap nematodes
[SPEAKER_03]: in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another big group, particularly the insect
pathogens, are in the sardariomycetes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and particularly in the order
hypochryales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here's some charismatic These are
the charismatic fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is growing out of a I think it's a
silkworm pupa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cordyceps fungus, very brightly
colored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are also various shapes
that grow out of beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually to lipocladium,
the fungus that Gillian attempted to
[SPEAKER_03]: pronounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing out of wood, but underneath there
is a beetle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of these fungi infect wood-boring
beetles, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here's a decaying log with to
lipocladium coming out and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: sporulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Labobeliales are not actually insect
pathogens, but they're ectoparasites,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're actually sexually transmitted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like humans, fungi have nutritional,
make nutritional choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the hypochryal, as I just
wanted to introduce you to the order,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm going to be talking about them
quite a bit today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's origin right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes organisms like Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everyone in this department has
heard about Fusarium, a major pathogen of
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of grasses, and other plant hosts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in green, I'm showing the
plant-associated members of hypochryales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are either plant pathogens,
or they're plant saprobes that degrade,
[SPEAKER_03]: they also degrade decaying plant material.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can call them the vegetarians.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the transition to the
hypochryale, so that's sort of the basal,
[SPEAKER_03]: the basal group of the hypochryales are
plant-associated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we move to this node in the
phylogeny, we have a shift to both
[SPEAKER_03]: mycoparasites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So microphagous fungi that attack other
fungi, things like trichoderma,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are used for biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here we have actually two
independent origins of insect and nematode
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll call these the true meat eaters.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually infect insects and nematodes
and use them as a food source.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a good nitrogen source,
insects and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that life, so this is a very
nice, tidy story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that real life is a little bit
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, one of the things that I'm
interested in are the variation in hosts
[SPEAKER_03]: across these fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was a phylogeny done by a former
postdoc in my postdoc lab that,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, tracks host associations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green is plant-associated, blue is fungal
host-associated, and red is insect or
[SPEAKER_03]: animal-associated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see there have been a lot of
host shifts within the hypochryales.
[SPEAKER_03]: These fungi are commonly shifting hosts
from being plant parasites to insect
[SPEAKER_03]: parasites to nematode parasites to fungal
parasites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very interesting aspect of
their ecology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly, there are also some
members, even the same strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: that can do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've probably heard about a fungus
called metarysium.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very commonly known insect
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rhizosphere competent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has actually also been shown to be
endophytic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it has both aspects of this
lifestyle and its ecology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, Bavaria bassiana, a very good
wide-host range insect pathogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: also colonizes plants as an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the things I'm interested in
is the stool aspects of the ecology of
[SPEAKER_03]: these fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, I'm going to tell you a few
stories about some different projects that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is really a phylogenomic
analysis of the order hypochryales,
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at changes in primary metabolism
and how those might shift at this change
[SPEAKER_03]: or transition from the plant-associated
host to insect or mycoparasitic host.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm going to tell you a little bit
about tilapicaladium and platinum,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly the role of oxidative enzymes
and secondary metabolites in insect
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a project I have, beginning,
working on Bavaria bassiana, which is an
[SPEAKER_03]: insect pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really trying to look at
intraspecific genetic diversity in this
[SPEAKER_03]: species in terms of secondary metabolite
potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can these fungi produce?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does that affect their virulence
or their ecology?
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, end with some work on
nematode parasites that I have a project
[SPEAKER_03]: working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to think about primary metabolism,
associated with the transition from plant
[SPEAKER_03]: to insect nutritional modes or host,
we actually need to think about some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the carbon sources and nitrogen sources
that these fungi might encounter on both
[SPEAKER_03]: of those hosts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in plants, obviously we have cellulose,
lignin, pectin, hemicellulose.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these things are things that a
fungus might need to be able to digest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in fungal parasites and insect
parasites, we oftentimes have chitin as
[SPEAKER_03]: the primary polymer of the cell wall of
fungi and also cuticle of insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's just to kind of summarize
the barriers that a fungus might find to
[SPEAKER_03]: attack a plant versus an insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a plant, we have an outer protective
layer composed of wax, cutin, cutane.
[SPEAKER_03]: In an insect, we also have what's called
the epicuticle, which in fact,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a little bit of a waxy layer as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It contains actually some long chain
hydrocarbons or alkane compounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as fatty acids, polyphenols,
and ferritinized protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of the first barrier for a
plant pathogen versus an insect pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the actual cell wall,
we have cellulose, hemicellulose,
[SPEAKER_03]: pectin versus protein and chitin in an
insect cuticle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once inside a host, we actually
have some very similar challenges,
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to grow in a very nutrient
limited environment inside the host,
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to evade the immune system of
both a plant and an insect, and also being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to survive oxidative stress,
which is a component of the defense
[SPEAKER_03]: response of both plants and insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we think about gene families,
so this was really a phylogenomic
[SPEAKER_03]: approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was in collaboration with a group
in China, actually, at the Chinese Academy
[SPEAKER_03]: of Science and Joey Spadafora.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're looking at the evolution of
several gene families involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: degrading some of these compounds across
the hypocrelies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we think about carbon degrading
enzymes, we think about chasimes or
[SPEAKER_03]: carbohydrate active enzymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have glycosyl hydrolases,
which include most of the cellulases,
[SPEAKER_03]: and other enzymes degrading cellulose,
like also transferases, polysaccharide
[SPEAKER_03]: lyases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these, in particular, I'm going to be
talking about pectin degradation,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the glue that holds together
plant cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then carbohydrate esterase and
carbohydrate bonding modules.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of oxidative enzymes,
we have cytochrome P450s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And proteases actually play a very
important role in insect pathogenesis in
[SPEAKER_03]: degrading the outer cuticle of the insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we look at the evolution of
chasime families across, this is the order
[SPEAKER_03]: hypocrelies again, starting right here at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have, at this point,
here we have a shift to either insect in
[SPEAKER_03]: red parasitism or fungal in blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're then looking at how do the
enzymes that degrade the components of
[SPEAKER_03]: plant cellulose versus the components of
insect cuticle and fungal cell walls,
[SPEAKER_03]: how does that change within a genome?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do see a decrease among,
a shift here in a general decrease in
[SPEAKER_03]: overall numbers of chasimes in both the
fungal and the insect pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we look specifically at,
you know, breaking down these families of
[SPEAKER_03]: chasimes, in particular, we have a very,
so here again, we see a decrease in really
[SPEAKER_03]: all families, particularly glycosyl
hydrolases involved in cellulose
[SPEAKER_03]: degradation and polysaccharide lyases.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, I mean, we talked about
those that degrade pectin, but you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: here the animal metarysium, telapacladium,
and cordyceps really only have three,
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas most of our plant pathogens have
numbers in the 20s to 30s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just to show you, in terms of
pectin catabolism, when we look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual pathway from degrading pectin to
pectate to degalacturinate, these are the
[SPEAKER_03]: enzyme commission codes involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we map that across this group in
terms of their ecologies, so plant
[SPEAKER_03]: associated in green, fungal in blue,
and red insect pathogens, you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: there is in fact a significant contraction
of this enzyme family at this transition
[SPEAKER_03]: to insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: These fungi no longer need these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of oxidative enzymes,
the cytochrome P450s, I'm sure most of you
[SPEAKER_03]: are familiar with them, but I thought I'd
just briefly describe them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're oxidative enzymes that use a heme
cofactor, and they're involved in the
[SPEAKER_03]: oxidation of various organic substrates,
so lipids, steroids, xenobiotics,
[SPEAKER_03]: or foreign compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly, they're also involved
in the synthesis of secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're generally classified based on
sequence similarity into families based on
[SPEAKER_03]: 40% amino acid similarity, and so this
would be the family CYP561, and
[SPEAKER_03]: sub-families based on 55% amino acid
identity, so sub-family C, and then an
[SPEAKER_03]: individual class or gene would be given a
number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across the, we look at oxidative enzymes
across this group.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also see an increase in the plant
pathogenic group, and a decrease in
[SPEAKER_03]: telopacladium and cordyceps, and insect
pathogens in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't mention this, this is
actually a CAFE analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've looked at the extant numbers in
current samples, and then using maximum
[SPEAKER_03]: likelihood inferred ancestral numbers at
each of these nodes, and then inferred
[SPEAKER_03]: increases at particular nodes or decreases
at particular nodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proteases, we also see a similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I didn't actually point out here
that in the metarysium group, we do
[SPEAKER_03]: actually see an increase in oxidative
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember that I said metarysium is
actually one of these fungi that has a
[SPEAKER_03]: dual ecology in terms of being able to
colonize both the rhizosphere and the
[SPEAKER_03]: roots, and also being a good insect
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So interestingly, they have retained some
of these enzymes that may be important for
[SPEAKER_03]: plant colonization.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of proteases, we also see a
similar pattern increasing in plant
[SPEAKER_03]: associated and also in the metarysium
clade, and then a decrease both in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fungal parasites and also in the insect
parasites or pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in conclusion from this part of the
talk, when we look at it widely across the
[SPEAKER_03]: order and across fungi with different
ecologies, we do see expansions in plant
[SPEAKER_03]: or I guess they could be either expansions
in the plant associated fungi or
[SPEAKER_03]: contractions, particularly in the insect
associated fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And particularly those genes involved in
cellulose and pectin degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insect pathogens have pretty much lost the
function of degrading cellulose and
[SPEAKER_03]: pectin.
[SPEAKER_03]: P450s and proteases, so a similar
expansion in the plant associated fungi
[SPEAKER_03]: and in those fungi that have a dual
ecology, they also show a similar or more
[SPEAKER_03]: broad profile of both of these classes of
enzymes than the true and strict insect
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now I'm gonna move on and talk a
little bit about my work on telapocladium
[SPEAKER_03]: inflatum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a mouthful, telapocladium inflatum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, it's a widespread soil
fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it was thought to be asexual
until Kathy Hodge from this department,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a photograph from the plant path
herbarium, discovered the sexual stage of
[SPEAKER_03]: telapocladium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought it was an anamorphic fungus
living in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in fact, it infects beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was first discovered on a scarab beetle
here in Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what's left of the beetle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here, sadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's infected the beetle and it's grown,
this is the stroma of the fungus,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's formed a fruiting body and up here
it's forming sexual spores and parathisia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and this is, this is actually what you
were looking at before in that picture
[SPEAKER_03]: with it coming out of the root of the
wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually growing through the wood and
then going out into the air to sporulate
[SPEAKER_03]: and spread its spores.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is also well known or most known in the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody knows what telapocladium
inflatum is, but how many of you have
[SPEAKER_03]: heard of the drug cyclosporin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a few of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess none of you have had organ
transplants, so that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's well known in the medical world
for being the producer of an
[SPEAKER_03]: immunosuppressant drug called cyclosporin
A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cyclosporin A is the product of a
non-ribosomal peptide sympathase gene,
[SPEAKER_03]: which as Billy mentioned, I studied for my
PhD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an 11 modular gene that forms an
11 amino acid or peptide ring,
[SPEAKER_03]: cyclic structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really was the compound that was
responsible for development of successful
[SPEAKER_03]: organ transplantation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually, at the University of
Minnesota Medical Center, there's a little
[SPEAKER_03]: picture of telapocladium on the mural
wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was writing up the escalator one day and
I saw, that's telapocladium.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has in fact made very important
contributions to medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before that, we had a real issue with
organ rejection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now most organ transplant patients
take cyclosporin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also used to treat a number of other
autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid
[SPEAKER_03]: arthritis and psoriasis, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's just a better diagram of the
life cycle of telapocladium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like a plant pathogen, it has to
infect its host.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly, does that also by
forming a form of apresoria and
[SPEAKER_03]: penetrating through the insect cuticle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a hyphae penetrating insect
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this I'm going to call the host
infection stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once inside an insect, many of these
insect pathogenic fungi undergo,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also human pathogenic fungi,
undergo a dimorphic switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they change from a hyphal stage to a
yeast stage in order to proliferate
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the insect hemicele.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they proliferate eventually causing
death and then sporulation on the insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a live weevil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the right here is a dead weevil
with telapocladium sporulating off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is also a mechanism to spread
spores to new insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we now know from the genome that
telapocladium inflatum is a heterothallic
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has two mating types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so only if we get two mating types
infecting the same insect, can we have
[SPEAKER_03]: mating and production of the sexual state
and sexual spores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's thought that both askospores and
the knidia can infect an insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there hasn't been a lot of study
on which is more important in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the studies that I've done is an
RNA-seq experiment to look at some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanisms of insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started out, I was afraid to work
inside an insect but this was my first
[SPEAKER_03]: foray into the insect world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I decided to grow the fungus in a
media, a minimal media containing insect
[SPEAKER_03]: cuticle added.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually dissected some weevils,
the cuticle and treated that and put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then isolated in hemolymph and put
that in the media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then collected RNA and did RNA-seq and
looking for responses to those two media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna talk a little bit but I'm
sure many of you are also familiar with
[SPEAKER_03]: the Go ontology where we're looking at
trying to classify genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it a very useful way to classify
functions of genes and talk broadly about
[SPEAKER_03]: transcriptional responses to a particular
condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at the top layer, we have again,
the cellular location or component of a
[SPEAKER_03]: gene or protein, biological process,
what general broad processes is involved
[SPEAKER_03]: with and molecular function, specific
enzymatic functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are again hierarchical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we move from very general to very
specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we do a network, look at
overexpressed and these are the
[SPEAKER_03]: upregulated genes from the cuticle media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are mapped to the genome of
telopoclade and protein genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're looking at overrepresented
gene, overrepresented categories of Go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we do find is that serine
peptidases and serine hydrolyses,
[SPEAKER_03]: which have been pretty well characterized
as being involved in penetrating or
[SPEAKER_03]: digesting the cuticle were one class
that's upregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have genes in oxidoreductase
activity and CDER for iron transport.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is gonna become a theme for
today's talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to look particularly at
cytochrome P450s and interestingly,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are a number from this CYP655 family
and CYP505 family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these have been actually studied in
Bavaria bassiana and shown to degrade
[SPEAKER_03]: alkanes and also in alkane assimilation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a fatty acid hydroxylase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one is involved in degradation of
oleic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a really nice paper that
came out in Bavaria that showed that
[SPEAKER_03]: several members of this class of
cytochrome P450s can actually degrade some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the cuticular hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hydrocarbon compounds found in
insect cuticle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's very likely their role in
CYP families 655 and 505.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we look at the genes upregulated in
hemolymph, we again see importance of iron
[SPEAKER_03]: binding and oxidoreductase activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a large category of genes
involved in sugar and carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_03]: transmembrane transport, which I still
don't really understand what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in, but we're looking into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of the cytochrome P450
family, there are a couple interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one right here, both of these from
different families, no, they're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: from the same family, 504, are involved in
ortho hydroxylation of phenyl acetate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And phenyl acetate is one compound that is
produced by the insect immune response.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these two genes could be involved
in detox inside of an insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another potential function of
the cytochrome P450s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of more primary,
different changes in primary metabolism
[SPEAKER_03]: and ways to utilize an insect versus a
plant host.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm going to move on to my
favorite topic, fungal secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolite genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure you've heard from Gillian a
little bit about categories of secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolite genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are non-ribosomal peptide
synthetases or NRPSs, polyketide synthases
[SPEAKER_03]: or PKSs, terpenes synthases, which produce
terpenes and isoprenoids, and dimethyl
[SPEAKER_03]: allyl tryptophan synthetases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which are involved in the first synthesis
step of many alkaloid, ergot alkaloid and
[SPEAKER_03]: alkaloid compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've also probably heard that NRPSs are
modular, both NRPSs and PKSs are modular
[SPEAKER_03]: in the sense that they're comprised of
protein domains that string together amino
[SPEAKER_03]: acids, non-ribosomally and link them into
a small peptide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly in polyketide synthases,
we have linkages of carbon molecules,
[SPEAKER_03]: usually acetyl or malonyl-CoA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another feature of secondary metabolite
gene clusters of fungi is that in most
[SPEAKER_03]: fungi cluster, many of the genes involved
in production of a particular metabolite
[SPEAKER_03]: into a secondary metabolite cluster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a cluster for cyclosporine
synthetase from teleplacladium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that it actually contains
both an NRPS and a PKS gene, as well as a
[SPEAKER_03]: large number of other kinds of accessory
proteins that may be involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: transport, modification or oxidation or
acetylation of the final product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do know a fair amount about,
I just wanted to briefly talk about some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the secondary metabolites that we have,
we know about from the hypokreoles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fumonacins from Pusarium and Eniatin are
both well, fumonacins in particular are
[SPEAKER_03]: important for plant pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pept eyeballs are an interesting group
from the trichoderma that these are large
[SPEAKER_03]: NRPS produced compounds that form pores in
membranes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a lot of compounds that
have shown some effect in terms of being
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, bavarisin, bacyanolide from Bavaria
species, they've been knocked out and
[SPEAKER_03]: shown to have a role in, they're not
pathogenesis factors, but they have a role
[SPEAKER_03]: in insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the ergot alkaloids and peramine
from epichloy species are really thought
[SPEAKER_03]: to be anti-fetent compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They interfere or they deter herbivory,
that's one of their functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also know that the ergot alkaloids
obviously have neurological effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure you've heard about some of
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally down here, we have
destructions from metarysium and
[SPEAKER_03]: cyclosporins from telipocladium,
which have effects on the insect's immune
[SPEAKER_03]: response.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're immune suppressants generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has been well shown for
cyclosporin in insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a control and this is a
cyclosporin treated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that this is production,
I believe, of proactive, it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: antibacterial, antibacterial peptides or
lysosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a really strong effect of
cyclosporin on the insect immune response.
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on that, we now know that
cyclosporin also interferes with the human
[SPEAKER_03]: immune response, binding to, interfering
with calcineurin, activating nuclear
[SPEAKER_03]: factors and the initiation of
transcription of interleukin-2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I looked at the expression of the
cyclosporin cluster in both of these
[SPEAKER_03]: different kinds of media, so the cuticle
media and the hemolymph media,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was expressed in both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was also very useful in defining
what genes are actually within the cluster
[SPEAKER_03]: and involved in biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these two are computational prediction
programs for defining a secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolite cluster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we actually did RNA-seq,
we found that it was actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found the intersection that is very
likely the set of genes involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does actually look like cyclosporin
is more highly upregulated in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hemolymph media, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably active once the fungus has
penetrated and it's in the hemocell,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's trying to kill an insect,
suppress the immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I would add in, I told Gillian I was
gonna add in a slide about iron metabolism
[SPEAKER_03]: and iron secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, this is something I worked
on for my PhD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gillian had determined that there were
really two different pathways of
[SPEAKER_03]: production of fungal siderophores.
[SPEAKER_03]: One leads to intracellular ferrocrime type
siderophores, the other to extracellular
[SPEAKER_03]: siderophores, an NRPS called NRPS-6 in
cochleobolis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for my PhD, I actually wrote a paper
on the fact that there are paralogs of
[SPEAKER_03]: these genes in several fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a gene duplication event,
and some fungi, including tolipocladium,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have two copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a copy from this group that
is homologous to the cochleobolis NRPS-6
[SPEAKER_03]: set, which form compounds known as
coprogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also have a copy homologous to a gene
in a human pathogen, aspergillus
[SPEAKER_03]: fumigatus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is known as CIDD, and it
produced, and also in Fusarium,
[SPEAKER_03]: which it produces a triacetylfuscin C-type
compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're interested in why does
tolipocladium have two, and we still don't
[SPEAKER_03]: fully know the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we look at its patterns of
expression, we do find that the coprogen
[SPEAKER_03]: type is more highly expressed in a cuticle
media, whereas the aspergillus homolog is
[SPEAKER_03]: more highly expressed in a hemolymph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been shown that the aspergillus
homolog is involved in human pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes sense that the tolipocladium
homolog may also have a function in insect
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this work really identified some
particular gene families that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: investigating to look at their roles in
insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So particularly oxidative enzymes and
those involved in response to oxidative
[SPEAKER_03]: stress, serine proteases involved in
penetrating the insect cuticle,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then iron scavenging and binding
molecules, which clearly have been shown
[SPEAKER_03]: to have roles in both plant and animal
pathogenesis, clearly also have roles in
[SPEAKER_03]: insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of secondary metabolites,
cyclosporin is the one that I'm continuing
[SPEAKER_03]: to work on and really trying to nail down,
we're doing some gene knockouts and
[SPEAKER_03]: tagging at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any results to report from
that yet, but we're really interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: what is it doing inside of an insect and
what is its target?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we actually, although we know the
target in humans, we don't actually know
[SPEAKER_03]: the target in insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny how that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then siderophores, iron scavenging is
clearly important.
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I doing for time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm gonna tell you a little bit
about a project that we're working on in
[SPEAKER_03]: Boveria, Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was actually really initiated by
a high school student that came to me one
[SPEAKER_03]: day and said, I'd like to do a science
project in your lab for something known as
[SPEAKER_03]: the Intel Science Fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nationwide competition for high
school students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did an amazing amount of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was an incredible undergrad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually had completed a math degree at
the University of Minnesota by the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: his high school degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is now in a BA MD program at the
University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was a special high school student.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did a lot of transcriptomic work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two post-docs have also worked on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Menke was my first post-doc.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a lot of genomics work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ruchika Badaj did a lot of insect
infection assays and followed up on some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I better introduce Boveria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boveria, as I mentioned, is best known as
an insect pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is actually, one strain is a component
of a biocontrol product known as,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is my control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually, I think there are two
biocontrol products out on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is an insect sprayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be sprayed on foliage and will kill
insect pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: But recently, it's also been discovered as
a system of a species that is only found
[SPEAKER_03]: in the roots of a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a GFP strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they showed that this is roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Metarysium and Boveria both grow in
the roots, whereas Boveria is also growing
[SPEAKER_03]: in the leaves, but Metarysium is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boveria is also a huge, Boveria basianae,
in particular, is a huge species complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still know very little about the
population structure or potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: phylogenetic structure of this group and
they're distributed worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also know very little about differences
in virulence and how do we go about
[SPEAKER_03]: selecting a good biocontrol strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is actually a collaboration
with Dr. Steve Rayner at the USDA in
[SPEAKER_03]: Beltsville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has an enormous collection of the
various strains and I've been working a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit with him on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And initially we've just started
sequencing about 10 genomes and this was
[SPEAKER_03]: done using Illumina technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did three out-group taxa,
Bavaria bastiana, Brognartii, Australis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Asiatica, I guess four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eight different strains of
Bavaria bastiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a fairly small genome with very
low repeat content so these were fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: easy to assemble to a good quality draft
genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have very little, very low repeat
content.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're nice fungus to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically when we look at
interests, one of our interests is to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at intraspecific diversity of secondary
metabolite genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we look across, so these are the
different categories of secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolite genes in the top here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all the different strains
and there is variation in really a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular the polyketide synthase
genes show high variation as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene synthase.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when we look at the genes that we
know have some function in insect
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogenesis, we don't see much variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just, Bavaricin for example,
is present in all of the Bavaria bastiana
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bacyanolide is present in all but one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tenalin, which is a NRPS-PKS hybrid
produced compound, is also present in all
[SPEAKER_03]: but one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not a lot of divergence in
terms of the NRPS genes that we know are
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: In insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we look at both polyketide
synthases and terpene synthases,
[SPEAKER_03]: we do see a lot more intraspecific
variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a comparison of six
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the bottom here is the number of
strains that share.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two strains share six genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually about 25 different PKS
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only four of them are shared across
all these strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's really a lot of
specialization in strain-specific
[SPEAKER_03]: secondary metabolite genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same is true of terpenes, although
there are less.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only four or five terpene synthase
genes in these fungi, but there's also
[SPEAKER_03]: variable numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found an interesting terpene
cluster that we're now following up on,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we actually see complete duplication
or loss of the entire gene cluster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a large gene cluster,
probably about 45 kilobytes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is absent in the ancestral outgroup
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it appears to have originated at the
origin of the Bavaria-Baciana species
[SPEAKER_03]: complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been lost in one strain and
duplicated in another strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we look at virulence,
we've also done some virulence assays of
[SPEAKER_03]: Bavaria on an insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're actually using a Lepidophila
spidopterin, the fall armyworm,
[SPEAKER_03]: or spidoptera frugaperida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're using injections.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure, interestingly,
Bavaria did not colonize the cuticle very
[SPEAKER_03]: well of this particular insect,
which was interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided to go with an injection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a much more exact approach to
inject a certain amount of spores into an
[SPEAKER_03]: insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also grow control in a liquid
media, minimal liquid and also PDV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at 24 and 48 hours, harvested
actually the whole insects and the tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: from the fungus to do RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also look at the time to death and to
sporulation and the LD50.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we look at a survival curve,
we had a few, this is our control,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had a few losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have this one in the middle,
which actually corresponds, I believe,
[SPEAKER_03]: to three, four, zero?
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's really two groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the control, and there's a couple
in the middle, and then very strongly
[SPEAKER_03]: virulent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we look at, we compare those two
strains, three, four, zero, where we have
[SPEAKER_03]: a complete loss of the cluster,
and three, 18, where we have a duplication
[SPEAKER_03]: of the cluster, we do see a really strong
effect on virulence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at day seven, in three, four,
zero, 90% of those insects are dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: In three, 18, only 18, or I'm sorry,
90% are alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in three, 18, only 18% are alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a much quicker time to death,
which is a measure of virulence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're now kind of following up on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing some gene knockouts at the
moment to really try to characterize,
[SPEAKER_03]: does this have a specific role in insect
pathogenesis, and what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, when we look at expression,
and this is at, we didn't actually see
[SPEAKER_03]: much change at 24 hours, but when we look
at 48 hours after injection, we both see
[SPEAKER_03]: initiation of an insect immune response,
and we also see turning on a fungal genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we have genes involved in
oxidation, oxidative activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, we also have genes involved
in fatty acid biosynthesis, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatty acids are becoming shown to be
important in various signaling processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, so this is general biological
processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in terms of molecular function,
again, we have oxidoreductase activities
[SPEAKER_03]: and metal binding.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, iron comes out of that as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these two categories are clearly
important in insect pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have a holo acyl carrier
protein synthase activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you know, many of the secondary
metabolites actually use an acyl carrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Protein mode of action to attach amino
acids to the NRPS protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also found some interesting
candidate secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a PKS that appears to be
homologous to a lovastatin biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_03]: cluster, an NRPS gene, a fatty acid
synthase gene, and also three acyl
[SPEAKER_03]: adenylating enzymes, which are really just
the one domain of an NRPS protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in conclusion, it's clear that
variation in the secondary metabolism can
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially confer important differences
in phenotype, particularly virulence in an
[SPEAKER_03]: insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really working right now on
doing some of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, I believe, now have a gene knockout
of the turpene synthase and also some
[SPEAKER_03]: chemistry to really nail down what is this
thing producing and what might be its
[SPEAKER_03]: effect on the insect immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few more slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the tale of my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also have a project working on
nematode pathogens and parasites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a large part of that is actually
collecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been collecting a large number of
fungi from agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a soybean corn rotation in Minnesota,
which is pretty much all you see in
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota, a soybean or corn field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've collected them from, this is
actually the soybean cyst nematodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've collected them from eggs of the
soybean cyst nematode, from soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: from soybean roots, and various
environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the final part of this project is
to look at mechanisms of virulence and
[SPEAKER_03]: also toxins that might be produced by some
of these fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was worked by a master student.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's still actually working on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was interested in comparing several
different nematode parasites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one that's a trapping fungus,
Arthrobatus oligospora, an egg parasite,
[SPEAKER_03]: Metacordyceps chlamydosporia, and a J2
parasite.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a J2 is a worm stage of the nematode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the infective stage of a
root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Hirsutella minnesotensis,
isolated from Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he was interested in looking at
what are their similarities or differences
[SPEAKER_03]: between the way that these different
nematode parasites interact with a
[SPEAKER_03]: nematode.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did clustering on the genome level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an orthologous clusters of gene
families across the three pathogens and
[SPEAKER_03]: found that there's more similarities
between Metacordyceps and each of these
[SPEAKER_03]: other fungi, so lots of shared genes,
than between the J2 parasite and the
[SPEAKER_03]: trapping fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he also did an RNA-seq experiment
where he grew up the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to use liquid culture just
to get enough tissue to do RNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we added either, so for the J2 or worm
parasites, we added a co-culture of
[SPEAKER_03]: sterilized worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the egg parasite, we added
sterilized eggs and then collected RNA
[SPEAKER_03]: samples at day one, three, and seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, when we look at, so this is an
early interaction at 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're excited to see something related
to chemical stimuli.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we're interested in
in these nematode parasites is,
[SPEAKER_03]: are there chemical signals either from the
plant or from the fungus or from other
[SPEAKER_03]: nematodes that we could utilize for
biocontrol?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're looking into some of the
genes in this category.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also this category of response to
misfolded proteins, so some heat shock
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins, which we are not clear what
those are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, when we look at molecular
function, we also see oxidoreductive
[SPEAKER_03]: activity and iron binding and also
carbohydrate kinase activity, which I also
[SPEAKER_03]: have no idea what that is involved in at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when he compared, so this is
looking again at the early response.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he compared upregulated genes and
looked at orthologous clusters of those,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, there are more similarities between
metacorticeps and each of these other
[SPEAKER_03]: fungi than between the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also identified a group of what we
call core orthologous clusters that might
[SPEAKER_03]: have a shared common role in nematode
pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those categories are,
in fact, heat shock proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: These ones, we don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still working on those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another category that has some
secondary metabolite genes in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually an interesting PKF gene
in this cluster 24 that may have a role in
[SPEAKER_03]: nematode pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in conclusion, it's clear that there
are some shared mechanisms of pathogenesis
[SPEAKER_03]: across different nematode parasites and
even insect pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are actually very closely related
fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may not be that much of a shift to
move from an insect to a nematode ecology.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many shared enzyme families that
are involved in pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also identified some interesting
secondary metabolite candidate genes that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're now working on some genetic
approaches to fully characterize their
[SPEAKER_03]: functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that, I will thank some
people, a long list of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of our genomics work has been
done at both the Mayo Clinic and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota Biochemical-Biogenomal Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And telopicaladium was actually sequenced
at Duke University with funding from an
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting source, a mushroom production
company in Korea, interested in trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand how these fungi fruit and
fruiting genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mating type genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the telopicaladium genome and
transcriptome is done in collaboration
[SPEAKER_03]: with Joey Spadafora's lab at Oregon State.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Bavaria project, they're working
with Steve Rayner at the USDA,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then these postdocs and outstanding
high school students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And funding that's mostly funded right now
through the University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this comparative work on the
genomics and toxin production of nematode
[SPEAKER_03]: parasites is sort of synergistic with the
project that we have from the USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: identifying nematode parasites and
pathogens for potential biocontrol or
[SPEAKER_03]: biopesticide use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also a little bit of funding from the
Minnesota soybean growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in Minnesota, it's good to get
funding from the Minnesota soybean
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that, I thank you and I'm
happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still looking at that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now moving on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done the insect pathogenicity
assays.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to do some plant
pathogenicity assays in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to assess that, and then we
are going to address that question,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's actually another graduate
student, she's actually co-advised,
[SPEAKER_03]: who's doing an experimental evolution
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's looking at, if I passage it
through an insect multiple times,
[SPEAKER_03]: how does the genome change?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I passage it through a plant multiple
times, how does the genome change?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will actually be very interesting,
I think, with these same strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Minnesota soybean growers,
do they use GMO products like Monsanto to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow their soybeans?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other question is very interested
in, so what's the overall plan on doing
[SPEAKER_01]: all this kind of genome work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that for health reasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the bio industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm very curious of what the
infected insect fungus is doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of people are interested in
that for all host of energy powering or
[SPEAKER_01]: Viagra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was at a talk this fall up at
Cornell with a professor that was in
[SPEAKER_01]: Nepal, working in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: On roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that there's a lot of people
collecting worms in Nepal and selling them
[SPEAKER_01]: to China.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that infected, the way you're saying,
used for Viagra reasons, and probably for
[SPEAKER_01]: other reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think there are a lot of
potential applications to this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my work with the Minnesota soybean
growers is really an agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we find bio pesticides?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we find an organism that we could use
for biocontrol?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've actually, Gillian mentioned I was
in China for a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually studied this fungus that
grows in Nepal and China.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is clearly a medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, looking at
tulipoclatium also, there's clearly
[SPEAKER_03]: medical things that we have not discovered
from these fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Stuart is working on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are compounds that we have no idea
that exist in these fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an untapped resource, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cyclosporine, I know you don't know
the target in insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you treat insects with it,
what's the effect on various forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they become more susceptible to
infection with fungi?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you treat it with cyclosporine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-treat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-treat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have actually done that experiment that
would be interesting to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah, at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gillian?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
