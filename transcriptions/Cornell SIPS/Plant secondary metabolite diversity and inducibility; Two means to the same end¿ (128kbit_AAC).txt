[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always very nervous when I speak at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called imposter syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when the others find out that
you're not bereft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you feel, at least, that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope I can show you something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually want to take a little bit of a
risky tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you may have seen at least parts
of the first part that I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want you to take part in a process
that I went through while thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: plant responses to any kinds of
environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I emphasize plant responses here,
not right away start with plant
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance, which is what we are actually
studying in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So induced responses that are functioning
as resistance, eventually, against insect
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivores.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would rather take that much more
neutral step and viewing all plant
[SPEAKER_02]: responses as neutral to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will see why I'm sort of
emphasizing that in the beginning already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I actually start, I want to
show you the people that are involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: most of what we are doing, what I'm
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are two post-docs in my lab who
both left this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuart Campbell and Ryko Olichke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, that's the third post-doc who
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's also involved in the work that I'm
showing today, Yakan Uesuki.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's some places open now in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are a grad student,
Kim Morrell, and an undergrad student,
[SPEAKER_02]: Amy Erickson, who I will show data today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, the undergrad students here
in the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two of them only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one was back here in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all just last year wrote each one a
paper on their honors thesis that are now
[SPEAKER_02]: in review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: To have this group of undergrad students
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I talk about induced plant
responses, then I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolic changes of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the most basic sense, you can
envision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we not only talk about changes in
secondary metabolite production,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also Bob Turgeon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote me an email this morning that he
wanted to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he knows very well that also primary
metabolism is changing dramatically in
[SPEAKER_02]: response to any kinds of environmental
stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more or less depending on the plant
species, more or less depending on plant
[SPEAKER_02]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see some of that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens when an insect is actually
feeding very strongly depends on the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental condition in which the plant
is growing, on the plant species that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at, and on the insect
herbivore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is probably the most important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you want the attacker in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm saying insect herbivore because it
can be as fine tuned as in this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a chrysomelid beetle or larvae of
a chrysomelid beetle called Tri-Raptor
[SPEAKER_02]: Virgato is feeding on golden rats who are
now nicely flowering outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they feed on these golden rats.
[SPEAKER_02]: In golden rats, you can based on the
secondary metabolite production,
[SPEAKER_02]: tell two different chrysomelid beetle
species apart on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very consistent across different
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means even though there may be
large genotypic differences in the
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance of those plants to the
different species, the response that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants have after they are attacked by
these herbivores go all in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell you that in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come back to that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now people have speculated about
induced or the function of induced
[SPEAKER_02]: responses a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I told you, induced resistance was
the one thing that came up and everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants become more resistant after they
are attacked and change their metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is true in many cases,
but by far not in all cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also have cases of induced
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the metabolism changes to the benefit
of the herbivore attacking the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may be no changes at all,
which people who work here on pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: and herbivores may be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of experiments that seem not
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are simply nothing happens to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seemingly nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that induced responses of plants
also mediate is something, and I also want
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of take a more neutral stem to
that, is called indirect resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this particular case, it's the
metabolic change in the plants provides
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of information that allow
another organism, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: an organism of the third trophic level,
a predator, to use that information and
[SPEAKER_02]: find their prey.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it's a mirrored buck that is
the herbivore in this case, and kill that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this particular example,
it's about a tobacco plant that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: working on with Ian Baldwin already at
Marks Plung.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we continued here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, the damage by the herbivores
is inducing a very specific volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: emission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean species or herbivore species
specific volatile emission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those volatiles can be detected by those
predacious bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in, kill the herbivore,
and save the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this particular case, it's actually
very efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can reduce or the plant's ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did that with genetically modified
plants that were not able to emit
[SPEAKER_02]: volatiles or not able to respond to damage
per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, both of these things we tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in all of those cases, a plant that is
not responding to the damage and therefore
[SPEAKER_02]: is not providing information to the
environment, and in this particular case
[SPEAKER_02]: is not emitting volatiles, has a 90%
higher damage rate than a plant that can
[SPEAKER_02]: do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a traumatic effect of traumatic
indirect effect through the third trophic
[SPEAKER_02]: level interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people came up with a lot of theories
of why plants change their metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype in response to damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do you have this kind of stress
response?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the beginning, in fact,
it was totally focused on induced
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people found that if you put an
insect herbivore on a plant that has been
[SPEAKER_02]: damaged already, they usually perform
worse on these plants in comparison to a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that was not damaged before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first ones were, for example,
Rhodes here, who wrote about an
[SPEAKER_02]: evolutionary hypothesis for why plants do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came up with the idea that,
well, it's simply a part of what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: the optimal defense theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So optimal defense theory says that plants
should allocate their resources so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefit they gain from investing into
defense does not compromise their
[SPEAKER_02]: reproductive success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what that means is when a plant is
responding to an insect or a pathogen or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, it's changing its phenotype,
it is, based on this hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_02]: investing into costly defenses only when
it's needed in the case of an actual
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivore attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And otherwise, if there's no herbivore or
no pathogen, they wouldn't invest into
[SPEAKER_02]: those defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is optimal defense theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And induced resistance was seen in the
early days as a cost saving strategy that
[SPEAKER_02]: is functioning on the plant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within a lifetime of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant can allocate resources as
needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read about that in the Carbon and
Baldwin book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there's a nice review and
quarterly review of biology by Nancy Stemp
[SPEAKER_02]: very recently that sort of summarizes all
the defense hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is overall inducible resistance as
a cost saving strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were two very nice papers,
one that derived actually from work that
[SPEAKER_02]: Ian Baldwin still did as a graduate
student here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one that now our own Anurag Agarwal
did, and they published it in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: year, both one in science, one in nature,
where they compared plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: constitutively investing into those
resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they treated plants so that it would
always be induced compared to plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: were never induced, compared to plants
that only had induced resistance when
[SPEAKER_02]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found that there's a high cost
when you have the plant constitutively
[SPEAKER_02]: induced.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This drove an entire field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're comparing two things,
two metabolic states of the plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: involve both, as I mentioned in the
beginning, primary and secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not that metabolic change is not in
fact only the up regulation of costly
[SPEAKER_02]: defense metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot compounds that are down
regulated in response to damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you who do some research,
HPLC or GCMS, whatever, they're in many
[SPEAKER_02]: cases almost as many compounds down
regulated as up regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you cannot make that cost argument at
all cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, it's not that clear how
costly these compounds really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have tried to analyze that and
to calculate it through and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems to be all within the
tolerance range that a plant has available
[SPEAKER_02]: and resources to allocate into some
defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for plants, it's not that costly to
produce these compounds, presumably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there were other hypotheses that
people came up with then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other one was the distribution of
damage within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have a modular plant,
most plants are actually modular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have one branch here and one
branch here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's damage on this branch,
it's inducing resistance, forces the
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivore to move over.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea behind that is if you have one
branch and all leaves of that branch are
[SPEAKER_02]: stripped down, the seed production on this
branch will be much lower than if you had
[SPEAKER_02]: that same amount of damage distributed
across the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then the damage on each branch may
be within the tolerance range that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant has to compensate for the amount of
damage that it receives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very, very good one, but there's
only very few studies done on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one actually that was the
original one was a model study,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a mathematical model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is the only one that actually
thoroughly tests it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the third one I already talked about,
the attraction of predators and
[SPEAKER_02]: parasitoids to the plant requires a
metabolic change, because otherwise
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the herbivores are presumably under
selection to be stealth feeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not being seen by anyone,
by any predator, by any parasitoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will see a lot of adaptations in
insect herbivores if they are not
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves very toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case, they're aposematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will smell exactly like the plant,
or they will look exactly like the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they will be underneath the leaf,
or these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be not seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, there's a benefit from the
plant's perspective to attract predators
[SPEAKER_02]: in through a larger signal, potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could be induced with a volatile
emission.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that only works if the metabolism of
the plant changes with herbivory,
[SPEAKER_02]: because otherwise there's no information
in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a plant, for example, would
constitutively emit volatiles,
[SPEAKER_02]: the predators would soon figure out there
is no prey associated with that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: cue that's coming off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is one almost forgotten
so-called moving target hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_02]: was brought up by Rick Carbon on his then
postdoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this comes from military, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Military strategy kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you move around a lot, you are a
much worse target.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you are standing in place,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the military people use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his argument was, this is exactly what
plants do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not a per se fitness benefit of
producing the compounds only when needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simply the metabolic change that is
adaptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the increased production of
defensive metabolites or resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: mediating metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is simply the metabolic change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant becomes something different
for an insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes sense to a certain extent,
because all insects, but in particular
[SPEAKER_02]: those that feed on larval stages on
plants, have this initial feeding bouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have their first feeding is very
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they wait for a relatively long
period of time before they continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is when they ready their
detoxification enzymes and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They optimize their digestion to that
exact plant genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the plant is in that time frame
changing its metabolism, it becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it becomes that moving target that the
insects have a hard time to follow,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which case the simple change in
metabolism over time is adapted from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's perspective because it will reduce
the fitness of the herbivore on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we wanted to study all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of, as I mentioned,
will give you some information that some
[SPEAKER_02]: of you may have seen already from our work
on wild tomatoes in Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we wanted to study these kinds of
effects on wild species, and that started
[SPEAKER_02]: an entirely new kind of thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to have you be part in that
kind of thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 of the 14 so far described tomato
species grow on the Pacific slope of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, in general, habitat that
looks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a relatively dry habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the wild tomatoes, in comparison to
other plant species, are extremely drought
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are usually the plants that are green
and flowering when everything else is
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow, like in this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they continuously flower throughout
the entire year and have green leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the entire year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant species that I want to focus on
in this talk is one that is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most widely distributed wild tomato
species called Solanum peruvianum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to mention, there's some studies
that we want to initiate on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant grows in the valley where we
are working from 500 meters above sea
[SPEAKER_02]: level up to 3,800 meters above sea level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Continuous population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, everything changes along that
gradient, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are worried that actually the plant
species may change too, but this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: yet figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this plant is attacked by a large
number, or relatively large, and for us
[SPEAKER_02]: surprisingly, large diversity of insect
herbivores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And originally the idea was to study in
very detail, and this was physiological
[SPEAKER_02]: detail, the plant's specific responses to
those different herbivores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turned out, interestingly,
that the wild tomatoes that we study are
[SPEAKER_02]: not specific at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, it doesn't quite matter
which herbivore is feeding on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant will generally do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To an extent in this case, that we now
wonder whether or not this is adaptive in
[SPEAKER_02]: this particular case for a particular
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know that is this one future
study that we want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other things that we had figured out,
we see a couple of induced metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: changes that include secondary metabolite
production, anti-digestive protein
[SPEAKER_02]: production, like protein as inhibitors and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see an induced resistance to
herbivores, normally, not to all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's important though for my talk is
that the diversity of herbivores feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plant is only matched by the,
on the leaves, is only matched by the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity of organisms that feed on the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a also surprisingly high
diversity of bees feeding on those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the special thing is here,
you may know that actually all Solanum
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers have these anthocones where the
pollen sacs actually open to the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the bees or the pollinators have to
be specialized to get any pollen out of
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they do, they hook onto the plant,
vibrate their wings and it comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this viprotile or bus
pollination and it needs some behavioral
[SPEAKER_02]: specialization on the side of the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's surprising that we had
such a high diversity of bees doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we in fact established in this study,
the first encounter of Halictid bees,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are very small bees, to bus
pollinate flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were not known to bus at all,
the entire group of Halictids,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they do it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the thing was that when we started the
work with the wild tomatoes, what we
[SPEAKER_02]: figured out very quickly was we have
absolutely no idea about the ecology of
[SPEAKER_02]: wild tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing was known other than where the
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that was old data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie Rick's data pretty much from his
collections in Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those sites that he cited,
that are still cited on the website,
[SPEAKER_02]: are now paved over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't find the plants there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it took us quite a while to actually
find the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there was, in the literature,
was nothing known about the ecology,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing about the herbivores that are
naturally associated with those plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing about the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had to do some very general
ecological surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And among them was one survey where we
compared the proportion of leaves damage
[SPEAKER_02]: as a very crude measure of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this could be even in that category
here, you could have only 10% leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: removal, but every single leaf received a
little hole, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So every damage on a leaf was counted as a
yes on that leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get a percentage of leaves
damaged as a crude measure of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other hand, I just told you
about the pollination marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the proportion of flowers with
pollination marks as a measure for
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinator traction, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those pollination marks are these
brown marks which are a result of a
[SPEAKER_02]: polyphenol oxidase reaction when the bees
hold onto, when they bust pollinate,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have these claws and they hook onto
those anthocones and then very tightly
[SPEAKER_02]: hold on and then vibrate their wings so
that there's entire thing is vibrating and
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollen shoots out on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they collect the pollen from
their belly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this actually, this mark is species
specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you train your eye, you actually know
which bee species has done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it occurs within five minutes after a
pollination event happened, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, in fact, a pollination event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how successful it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may still be different between the
different bee species, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: a pollination event because it's normally
the bee's belly that's a touching the
[SPEAKER_02]: stigma down here and then pollen is
deposited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was our measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw this very interesting pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more damage you have on the plant
from herbivores on leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fewer flowers in those inflorescences
have pollination marks, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_02]: there is lower attraction of pollinators,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is just a correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two things may not be causally
linked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we started a small study
that generated everything I'm telling you
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did an experiment where we
manipulated herbivores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had plants that were not damaged and
then had a set of damaged and undamaged
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this particular case, they were damaged
by flea beetles simply because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to collect and to control on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have a certain number of
beetles feeding on the plant, and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually less than 10% leaf tissue
removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes important later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a significant reduction up to 25%
reduction in this particular case in
[SPEAKER_02]: proportion of flowers with pollination
marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fewer pollinators are coming to the
flowers when they're damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can simulate that when you apply
methyl jasminate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So methyl jasminate is methyl ester of
jasminic acid, which is a phytohormone and
[SPEAKER_02]: has been shown to be crucial for the
endogenous signaling associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you silence, for example,
we have done that in other plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you silence jasminic acid production in
a plant, inducible jasminic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: production, plants are not able to see a
herbivore feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no induced change in
response to that damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is herbivore feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you still see a response to a pathogen
though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you apply just simply methyl
jasminate, meaning without any damage,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is just making the plant believe that
I don't like to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you simulate damage by just providing
the endogenous signal that signals damage
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plant without any damage available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get a similar reduction in
pollinator attraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that translates in a traumatic
reduction in seed set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, a 25% reduction in seed
set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has a fitness effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually, in fact,
the largest fitness effect we have ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen coming from a herbivore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this particular case, it's simply
mediated through the attraction or
[SPEAKER_02]: non-attraction of a pollinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you could still argue, well,
maybe this reduction is simply due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that leaf tissue is removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, there are less resources
available to put into seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has nothing to do with pollinator
attraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we have fewer pollinators
coming, they would still produce the same
[SPEAKER_02]: number of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not necessarily the pollinators
that cause this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This reduction in seed set, it could be
simply the amount of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I told you in the experiment,
we used less than 10% damage, actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to make sure that this is
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did, we only used methyl
jasminate and then had open and hand
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with methyl jasminate, we already
exclude any damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet, methyl jasminate was,
or jasmonic acid per se, was first
[SPEAKER_02]: identified as a growth inhibitor,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just the signaling itself may reduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could use seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, when you have open pollination,
we get the same picture as we had before,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is now the number of seeds per
fruit produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you hand-polymate them and cover
them up, then you get even a slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: higher production than you have jasminate
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that shows that it's not due to limited
resource availability of the herbivore
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's due to limitation by pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we called that herbivore-induced
pollinator limitation, which is what that
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we wanted to figure out why that is
and now mechanistically why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do the bees actually avoid?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we looked for signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's two obvious ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is maybe an optical view that's
changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the flowers on the UV,
tomato flowers, usually the petals,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I should suppose to do it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's actually the picture is not so
clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The petals are actually reflecting UV,
while the anthocone is strongly absorbing
[SPEAKER_02]: UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So under UV, this is all shiny light and
this is black dark, even though it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow to us, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there could have been a change in that
visual cue in response to damage,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when I tell you metabolism
changes dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could be also the volatiles coming
out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how we trap volatiles in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we developed this very low-cost system.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this end, at least on the trapping
side, is low cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you run it on a GC, it becomes
more costly because we have far more
[SPEAKER_02]: samples to run, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this method allows you to do up to 16
samples per pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more pumps we can carry,
the more car batteries we can carry into
[SPEAKER_02]: the field, the more samples we can take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are now, we have some experiments
that go up to 120 samples per experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is we pull ambient air
through that chamber, over the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this particular case, over the
inflorescence, and onto absorbent tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they could be, in this particular
case, it's charcoal that's absorbing the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic compounds, and then you elute them
down with dichloromethane or hexane and
[SPEAKER_02]: analyze them in a GCMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how that looks like in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ryko, my long-term postdoc in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty dangerous in some cases
because the plants tend to grow on these
[SPEAKER_02]: landslides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it could be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we find?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blur your eyes and concentrate first on
the first two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are plants that were not damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a normal volatile emission
from leaves, not from flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a plant damaged by Manduka
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the tobacco hornworm,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be called, until 1964,
this was the tomato hornworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another species became the tomato
hornworm, and this became the tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: hornworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just highlight here, there's a number of
monoterpenes and a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: sesquiterpenes that are dramatically
upregulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look here, dramatically up in
response to damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you see normally in
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomatoes smell very different when you
damage them within herbivore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the interesting part was that,
now we go down here, if you compare leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: emission with flower emission,
there are a number of compounds that are
[SPEAKER_02]: only produced in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may say that's not a surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a surprise to me because if I put
my nose on a tomato flower, I don't smell
[SPEAKER_02]: a difference between the flower and the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably because the leaves
already smell so terpenoid that it blocks
[SPEAKER_02]: up everything that we can taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is actually, so there are a
number of compounds that are only produced
[SPEAKER_02]: in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the biggest surprise was that there
are a number of compounds that are only
[SPEAKER_02]: produced in the flowers and only in
response to herbivore damage on the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a specific metabolic change in
the floral metabolism in response to
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivore damage, which provides a
potential signal for the bees to
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiate, at least, between flowers
on damaged and undamaged plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for that, we had to, and I have to
speed up a little bit, we had to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I very briefly explained experiment
and very quickly go into the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want you to see the other more
evolutionary study.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we could take advantage of is that
these tomato plants are huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they often have three meters in
diameter in the field with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those branches are independent,
meaning that if you damage one branch,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can measure induced and systemic
induced resistance along that entire
[SPEAKER_02]: branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will not affect, at least not
directly affect a neighboring branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could have a control branch and a
damage branch on the same plant as the
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal kind of comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a paired comparison then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you can also do is you can bring
the inflorescences of both together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you can create is a chimeric
inflorescence that has either the odor of
[SPEAKER_02]: a damaged plant or the odor of an
undamaged plant or the combination of the
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to test whether or
not a visual cue is involved as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can cover up one part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this particular case, what that was
was in the back was the inflorescence on a
[SPEAKER_02]: damaged branch and outside is the visual
cue of an undamaged branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bees would be exposed to an
undamaged flower bouquet, but it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like a damaged, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you need a lot of controls for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to do this because we couldn't
take the bees home and do choice
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to do it in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it actually worked surprisingly good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did that with actual damaged plants
and also the methyljasmine-treated plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the methyljasmine-treated
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see here, so these,
in this case, both inflorescences are
[SPEAKER_02]: open.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here is a pair.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the full control, which has the
actual test inflorescence that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at as well as the one that's
supposed to be treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the control, it's not treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a double inflorescence of
undamaged flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this particular case, only this
inflorescence is on a damaged branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on an undamaged branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of them are down, already
suggesting that a volatile emission is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you cover this one up,
then you can only measure pollination
[SPEAKER_02]: here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there seems to be no visual cue
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all factorial, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just to make that quick,
so this is pretty much equivalent to this
[SPEAKER_02]: result.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because we were wondering, where's the
volatile emission coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, it's the flowers only in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we put leaves on a damaged plant in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also put methyljasmine only with
the flowers because methyljasmine can be
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled by bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be detected by bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So methyljasmine could actually here be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it means that the bees orient towards
or away from the flower-specific and
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivore damage-specific orders that are
in those flowers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this entire thing started an entire
new large project in my lab that was
[SPEAKER_02]: asking more evolutionary questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the chemistry, the fluorochemistry,
is so strongly linked to the overall plant
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism that is also changing in
response to herbivores, then there should
[SPEAKER_02]: be a very strong interaction, both
ecologically and evolutionary,
[SPEAKER_02]: between the selection by herbivores and by
pollinators on chemical traits of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like you have this very
negative effect on pollination by
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivores that this is kind of an
antagonistic interaction evolutionary,
[SPEAKER_02]: we would expect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to bring that together, so I'm just
concluding what I just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So herbivore-induced changes in plant
metabolism include vegetative and floral
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile emission.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollinators use the volatile emission
to avoid flowers and damage plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes with a fitness cost for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how long that fitness cost
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can discuss that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because those are perennial plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we obviously have only a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a little bit more to that
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could have that negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't talk about the morphological
changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, the flowers do not
morphologically change, especially to the
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively small amounts of damage that we
have on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what changes very consistently is the
length of the pistil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in tomatoes, and there's this nice
work by Steve Tangsley in this building,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, in the other building, it was the
other building, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When he was still here, they found that
the pistil elongation is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens at anthesis and is pretty much
only the expansion of cells at that stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this expansion of the cells is
seemingly inhibited when you have damage
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plant, which results in the pistil
being pulled back or stays back,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say pulled back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not pushed out of the anther cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it stays in the anther cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is another kind of question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the hypotheses that we derive
from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The correlated evolutionary process
between defensive and reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy and potentially habitat-specific
outcomes of this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, at first, it felt really difficult to
approach that from an evolutionary stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there are grad students that are
over-ambitious and advisors like me that
[SPEAKER_02]: allow that over-ambition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Stuart Campbell was in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he did was he took a total of 56
cells species of solanaceous plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: were in groups of self-compatible and
self-incompatible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were different in their mating
strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Self-compatible and self-incompatible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he tested all of them for their
induced responses to herbivory so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a measure for constitutive resistance
when you compare the self-compatible,
[SPEAKER_02]: self-incompatible within each group and
also the induced resistance of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of that grouping is that we
have phylogenetically independent
[SPEAKER_02]: replicates or independent comparisons
between a self-compatible and a
[SPEAKER_02]: self-incompatible species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually includes, in this
particular case, 19 independent replicates
[SPEAKER_02]: of the shift from self-incompatible to
self-compatible, which we commonly have in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in solanaceous plants, it is even more
pronounced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in all the phylogenies that you see
from solanaceous plants, there is no
[SPEAKER_02]: suggestion of a reversal of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it always goes phylogenetically from
self-incompatible to self-compatible and
[SPEAKER_02]: not reverse, meaning self-compatible is
the derived state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's important for later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what he did to these plants,
as I said, within each species,
[SPEAKER_02]: with replication, he had a control that it
was undamaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant that was mechanically damaged and
a plant that was damaged with manduka,
[SPEAKER_02]: he did all the chemistry for all of those
plants and then also fed the plants back
[SPEAKER_02]: to manduka neonate larvae to measure
resistance directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually the novel part in
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we standardize all the resistance to
the resistance to manduka.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can discuss whether or not this is
good because there may be other species
[SPEAKER_02]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you standardize it to the most
resistant plant, you can pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: compare resistance across the entire
phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why we did these two
treatments was that you then have a
[SPEAKER_02]: measure by comparing these two of the
specificity of the induced resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it specific to manduka or is it just
general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look at constitutive
resistance, meaning you only compare the
[SPEAKER_02]: controls with resistance in each group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, there's sort of
self-incompatible orange green and
[SPEAKER_02]: self-compatible orange blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you blur your eyes, you'd actually
see that there is no pattern, seemingly no
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that there is,
though, a slight increase of control for
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So self-incompatible species, in average,
have a higher resistance than
[SPEAKER_02]: self-compatible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something people had expected,
but nobody had really looked into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So self-incompatible, in average,
have a higher constitutive resistance than
[SPEAKER_02]: self-compatible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was kind of expected, not necessarily
that strong, but it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you blur your eyes here,
you see that very strong shift of the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: ones to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is reflecting that, if you look
at the inducibility, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: magnitude of change in resistance after
the plant was attacked by an herbivore,
[SPEAKER_02]: after resistance is induced, then
self-compatible species have a much
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger induction than self-incompatible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never expected that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let that sink in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Self-compatible species, so those who
sometimes inbreed, may or may not,
[SPEAKER_02]: but sometimes inbreed, are stronger
inducible than those that never inbreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you just look at the resistance at
the induced state, so you just compare
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance of damaged plants with each
other, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that self-compatible plants
compensate for their disadvantage in
[SPEAKER_02]: constitutive resistance by changing their
metabolism in a stronger way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I already gave you a hint,
the metabolism, in fact, is changing in a
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's only resistance in this picture,
but the metabolism is changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were asking, is there some pattern
that we can see in a secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_02]: production that could explain that
pattern?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a big surprise to me,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look at this, so these are
pairings that are actually in those
[SPEAKER_02]: comparisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four independent pairings in the
petunia genus, in the cestrum genus,
[SPEAKER_02]: and two in the solanum, but they're two
different clades within solanum,
[SPEAKER_02]: independent clades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the self-incompatible ones,
and here are the self-compatible ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see a difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, just blur your eyes a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are far more compounds over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no per se difference in the
amounts of compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just sum up all the compounds,
there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the diversity of
compounds produced, self-incompatible
[SPEAKER_02]: species have almost always more compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: than self-compatible species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now interestingly, so this is the picture,
actually, control for phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's highly, highly significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is only for phenolic compounds,
but you can do that for terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see pretty much the same picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the diversity of compound production is
higher in self-incompatible species.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that heterozygosity is affecting
diversity of compound production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within each plant, but also the
compounds available within populations,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that led to a hypothesis, and that's
why I'm speeding up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: that inducibility is generating diverse
phenotypes in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: High diversity, high compound diversity is
very strongly correlated with resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will show you a picture in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, after we found that, we went
through all of our data, diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: compound production seems to be the
strongest correlate with resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: in comparison in particular to just
individual compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just correlate individual compounds
with resistance, you never get a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation as the diversity of compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may give self-incompatible species
that advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the out-crossing advantage they
have potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that potentially leads to increased
natural selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is now our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't show that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increased natural selection on
self-compatible species for stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: inducibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the stronger inducibility allows
the plant to change its phenotype in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: to diversify its phenotype in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gives them the same advantage as
the high diversity compound production
[SPEAKER_02]: that the other species have, the
self-incompatible species have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that's correlated with this
is the specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I had the mechanical damage and
the caterpillar damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you plot the resistance effect on
caterpillar damage against those of
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical damage plants, if you have a
strong correlation there, which we have
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the green line, the
self-incompatible ones, then you have low
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same response.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that switches and becomes not
significant, then you have a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity in the response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is true in the self-compatible
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the self-compatible ones induce
stronger and induce more specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is this nice, considerative
induced resistance that was always
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothesized that there is a trade-off,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people hypothesized there must be a
trade-off between the expression of
[SPEAKER_02]: considerative resistance and inducibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our data actually support that
hypothesis in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my argument is that trade-off is not
necessarily a fitness-type trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, in fact, a reflection of two
alternative strategies, either having a
[SPEAKER_02]: high diversity of compounds produced and
not having to induce resistance or having
[SPEAKER_02]: a very low, because of the mating system
they are in, having a low compound
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity and therefore being on the
strong selection to induce very strongly,
[SPEAKER_02]: to diversify the phenotype in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the hypothesis that we are now
following up and do a lot of work on now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I have to stop here,
simply.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are only five more slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to stop here to allow for some
more discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in conclusion, what that means,
first, we have a very strong correlation
[SPEAKER_02]: between the reproductive and the defensive
strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the important point of this
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a macroevolutionary
correlation in this particular case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have, with work on native Solanum
carlinens, we showed that there is,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact, within a species a similar
correlation happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is something, too,
that mating system and resistance are
[SPEAKER_02]: strongly correlated and associated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what this here is actually providing
is, in fact, a new hypothesis for why
[SPEAKER_02]: inducibility can be important,
which is independent of the costs of
[SPEAKER_02]: compound production in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's highly independent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides an alternative strategy for a
plant that has to live, or for plant
[SPEAKER_02]: populations that have to live with low
compound diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I end here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope we can have some time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
No,
[SPEAKER_02]: we haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only within species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Solanum carlinens example,
there we had different herbivore species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, in fact, differently expressed
in different species, or with different
[SPEAKER_02]: species, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take, and this is purely because
the response to certain herbivores is
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger than to others, to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, certain herbivores respond more
or less to the changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an important ecological
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem for us, actually,
an ecological explanation problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what that means is, you would have
to know what is, in order to argue there
[SPEAKER_02]: may be natural selection on those traits
and on those, in this particular case,
[SPEAKER_02]: on inducibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know what the dominating
herbivore in the system is that might
[SPEAKER_02]: actually inflict fitness costs that are
high enough to drive natural selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that herbivore has to do
something to the plant that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the plant has to respond to that
herbivore in that particular way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of different,
which I didn't talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a large project on goldenrods
here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And goldenrod has one of the most diverse
offerable communities directly associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with them that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, in this area, about 120
herbivore species directly associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: goldenrod.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% of them are specialists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in those cases, you find everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you find induced susceptibility to one
herbivore, that, for example, that
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivore is inducing susceptibility to
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do better on the plants that they
themselves damaged, but they induce
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which suggests there might be some
manipulation of the inducibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be a cost of induction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is herbivores that induce
resistance to themselves so strongly that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to move away and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's any variation of the theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, it becomes the question,
which one of those herbivores is driving
[SPEAKER_02]: the evolution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it all of them together,
which is still a big question in that
[SPEAKER_02]: field anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very good question from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a wonderful question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a wonderful question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did a number of studies with Ian
Kaplan, who is now at Duke, who,
[SPEAKER_02]: for his PhD studies actually with us,
analyzed in tobacco whether or not
[SPEAKER_02]: induction through the roots and induction
through the leaves changed some effects
[SPEAKER_02]: above and below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a meta-analysis associated
with one of those papers, where we looked
[SPEAKER_02]: into, are below-ground insects affect
above-ground insects more than the other
[SPEAKER_02]: way around?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is actually that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have below-ground herbivory,
there seem to be stronger metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: effects above ground, and therefore
stronger ecological effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other way around is not as strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the question is, and this is still
kind of a weird thing in the field,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that simply because we have a harder
time measuring below ground, things that
[SPEAKER_02]: go on below ground, or is it a true thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at this point, I think a number of
people think that there is something
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamentally different between above and
below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are actually not yet there to say
something about it, to make that
[SPEAKER_02]: comparison truly happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is another good example,
is golden ruts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we relieve golden ruts from natural
selection by herbivores, the low-ground
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry goes up through the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this particular case, it's
supposedly an allelopathic compound that
[SPEAKER_02]: we see go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that compound is not only
allelopathic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually a highly cell-toxic
compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Japanese group looked at it,
and they kind of wanted to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you call it, an ethnobotany kind of
approach to golden rut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tested it on mammal cell tissue
cultures, on nematodes, on bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it kills everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question is, is there simply
resources freedom?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an evolutionary process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's natural selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different genotypes that do that in
those populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was we repeated that
experiment that Jake Root did,
[SPEAKER_02]: a very famous experiment where he had
golden rut populations right out here and
[SPEAKER_02]: had plots that he sprayed with insecticide
for a number of years and left the other
[SPEAKER_02]: open to ambient herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it found huge effects on the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were studying the community
interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they saw that the diversity is
dramatically dropping when you take the
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivores out, because you benefit the
dominating plant species in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Solida galtissima.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was, out of those plots,
we took samples and clonally reproduced
[SPEAKER_02]: them so that we had independent replicates
of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you compare them, you see they're
completely different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that are phenotypes too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So different phenotypes that are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have lower resistance when they
are in the spray plots, even when you have
[SPEAKER_02]: them several years now out of the plots
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have this very interesting,
traumatic, traumatic increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: allelopathic hormone production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is definitely both
evolutionary and on an ecological level,
[SPEAKER_02]: a very strong interaction that we,
and I agree with that, totally
[SPEAKER_02]: underestimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not time to say whether or not
the mechanisms that mediate those
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions are different below and above
ground.
