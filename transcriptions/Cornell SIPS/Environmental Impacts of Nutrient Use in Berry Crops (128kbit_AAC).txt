[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Laura McDermott.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with Kathy Heidenreich and
Marvin Pritz and Dr. Harold Finesse on
[SPEAKER_00]: this Soil Management and Berry Crops
grant, and I'm happy to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that there will be a few other
folks joining us here as we get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to, I think probably most of you
have already taken the time to fill out
[SPEAKER_00]: the SARE demographics questionnaire and
the educator pre-test, which is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: file box on the lower right-hand corner of
your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this is your first time visiting us
for one of the webinars and you have not
[SPEAKER_00]: done it, please take a few moments either
right now or at the end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation to fill that out and send
that to Kathy Heidenreich.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important for the grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on that topic,
I might also remind folks that we are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the final phase, the last three webinars
today, then March 2nd, and then the final
[SPEAKER_00]: one will be on March 9th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, we're going to have a
post-test of all the educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're going to have a really
good showing for that final webinar
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a very important
consideration in how effective the
[SPEAKER_00]: webinars are for relaying educational
information that Extension folks can use
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to remind those of you who
have been in attendance for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: these webinars that we are hopeful that
you'll take the opportunity to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using all of the materials that will be
available to you as participants in this
[SPEAKER_00]: first portion of the grant, we'd like to
have you take those educational materials
[SPEAKER_00]: out into the field and host some grower
workshops, grower field days, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of report back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kathy has some formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions,
you can contact her or myself about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'd love you to start to get your
head around that and plan for something
[SPEAKER_00]: this growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get going, also, I'd like to
make sure folks know a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of you have done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can type into the chat box,
a long, narrow box at the bottom in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you enter your comments and
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will try to keep track of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go ahead and introduce yourself if
you haven't done that yet, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: may feel like you do it every single time,
it's helpful for the presenter to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get to know where everyone's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, the web links, which is in
the lower left corner, you can click on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can actually browse to that
right now or at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go back to this kind of
format at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll also be accessible as the
recorded webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, this is the 10th in a series of 12
berry crop nutrition and soil management
[SPEAKER_00]: training webinars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our speaker today is Dr. Harold Van
Ness, who's the professor and chair of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Crop and Soil Sciences at
Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will now switch into that
presentation mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Van Ness's current research and
extension interests are in precision
[SPEAKER_00]: management of nitrogen, soil health,
and space and time statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches an undergraduate course in soil
management for sustainability and a
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate course in that space and time
statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has authored over 100 refereed
publications and four books and advised 45
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm exhausted for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really glad that he's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Harold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pleasure to be joining this
group again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at my calendar, and it was almost
exactly four months ago when I did the
[SPEAKER_01]: first webinar, one of the early ones on
basic soil information and soil management
[SPEAKER_01]: principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, we've discussed,
as a group at least, nutrient management
[SPEAKER_01]: and soil health management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing that mostly from a production
perspective today, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talking more about some of the
environmental impacts and how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a little bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outline for today, and by the way,
I just put my picture up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a slightly different picture than the
other one, just to make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more personal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll start today with a discussion of
environmental loss processes, then erosion
[SPEAKER_01]: and runoff prevention, then we'll talk
about managing phosphorus, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: managing nitrogen, do a summary,
and then we'll go into the question and
[SPEAKER_01]: answer session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to organize my slides and my
presentation in a way I think that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you to take some concepts that you
can use with your stakeholders that will
[SPEAKER_01]: help you, I think, in your educational
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start looking at environmental
losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary ones that we might be
concerned about with berry production is
[SPEAKER_01]: sediment, nitrogen, phosphorus,
and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should say up front that most of the
berry production is done in a way that is
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively sustainable, has relatively
little environmental impact, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to corn production, which is more
large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an annual crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these soils are being tilled on
an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we compare that to most berry
crops, we're dealing with perennials and
[SPEAKER_01]: not as much tillage and typically not as
much nutrient inputs either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often the environmental impact may be
smaller, yet we do need to be concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about that and we need to take that
serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the picture here, you see basically
the basic hydrologic cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main point is that these
environmental losses occur when we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of water in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water, of course, comes mostly as
precipitation, in some cases a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: as irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it's the extreme precipitation
events when we get an inch or two or even
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we tend to have the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an important concept to consider is
what happens at the precipitation when it
[SPEAKER_01]: reaches the land surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can basically go in two directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can either infiltrate or the water that
does not infiltrate then runs off and
[SPEAKER_01]: creates all kinds of problems because it
will take with it these contaminants like
[SPEAKER_01]: sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it takes sediment then we refer to
that as erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may readily, of course,
reach streams or other water bodies like
[SPEAKER_01]: lakes and estuaries and that is in general
very undesirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're lucky, all the water
infiltrates and then it's being held in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to refer to the soil as a sponge
and the soil holds on to that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then makes that available to the
plants through evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's excess water in the soil then
it will percolate further down either to
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper groundwater or maybe shallow
groundwater that might eventually reach a
[SPEAKER_01]: stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if chemicals go with the
percolating water then we refer to that as
[SPEAKER_01]: leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think about these loss pathways,
the ones that we're concerned about are
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff mostly with phosphorus to a lesser
extent with nitrogen and then maybe with
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: For erosion which means that runoff that
takes with it all the sediments and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sediment in turn may have a lot of
phosphorus with it or some nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of these contaminants are
concerned when we have erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Erosion is a really bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have leaching we're concerned
mostly with nitrates and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus basically doesn't leach except
in some very unusual circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally we have a concern about
gaseous losses and that is typically not
[SPEAKER_01]: directly driven by water but indirectly
especially when it comes to nitrous oxide
[SPEAKER_01]: which is generated when the soil becomes
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it's saturated and there's no
air in the soil and then the nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_01]: transformed from say nitrate to nitrous
oxide and of course this is a big concern
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a serious greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 300 times more potent than carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may have some gaseous losses of
pesticides which is really unrelated to
[SPEAKER_01]: water typically that has to do with the
properties of the pesticide itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to discuss pesticides in
detail today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit beyond the scope of what
we wanted to talk about so we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on sediment, nitrogen, and
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the environmental loss potential in
general is affected by a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one obviously the weather we discussed
that if you have a lot of intensive
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall you have higher potential for
runoff and erosion and excess water also
[SPEAKER_01]: generates leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondarily we have these inherent soil
properties like texture and organic matter
[SPEAKER_01]: which also affects you know basically
where the water goes and what it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and then we'll discuss that in a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thirdly, soil health and we've talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Schindlbeck mentioned that in the
previous webinars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we build up our soil and we make it
healthy with say good aggregation then we
[SPEAKER_01]: can reduce the environmental loss
potential significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally perhaps the what we might
call the more real-time soil management
[SPEAKER_01]: practices such as whether we cultivate the
soil which may expose it to the elements,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we have soil cover like mulch,
whether we traffic the soil causing
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction, and those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course last and not least is
you know how much fertilizer we apply
[SPEAKER_01]: either organic or inorganic fertilizer and
where we place it because of in principle
[SPEAKER_01]: the more fertilizer or other organic
materials that we put out there the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: the potential that we have losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll come back to these individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first let's discuss you know the basic
inherent properties of soils and how that
[SPEAKER_01]: affects potential environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know texture or the distribution of
particle sizes in terms of sand,
[SPEAKER_01]: silt, and clay is probably the most
fundamental property and you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: all familiar with the textural triangle
and it provides the basis for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these environmental loss considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to talk to my students or to
stakeholders as the soil particles and the
[SPEAKER_01]: texture of the soil sort of defining what
we might call the house, the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to use the analogy of a house
in that you know you have the structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: the house which is the walls and the roof
and the basement and all that and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the most visible part of a house and
particles for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most interesting part however is what
happens in the spaces between the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: particles or with the house analogy what
happens in the rooms because that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: all the processes take place, that's where
the organisms are, that's where the life
[SPEAKER_01]: is, and that's where the interesting
things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in soil there's bacteria, fungi,
all kinds of organisms that live in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pores and that's also where all the
important processes of water and air
[SPEAKER_01]: movement occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to have people farmers and
students to think in soil in terms of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: not just in terms of the particles but
have them think in terms of the spaces
[SPEAKER_01]: between the particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think about a sandy soil then
most of those pores are relatively large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although in general terms we're still
talking about less than two millimeters in
[SPEAKER_01]: most cases but by soil standards those are
very large pores and those pores will lose
[SPEAKER_01]: their water very quickly because the
capillary force that we see when large
[SPEAKER_01]: pores is relatively weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely when we talk about clay soils
we mostly have small pores, the capillary
[SPEAKER_01]: force is really strong and they retain the
water very tightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but if we have a clay soil that
actually has good aggregation then we may
[SPEAKER_01]: have a few larger pores that are between
the aggregates so then we maybe have both
[SPEAKER_01]: small and large pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an example of an aggregate that
has the range of pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has the larger pores, and those
facilitate infiltration and drainage,
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration and rooting because they lose the
water very quickly because of the weak
[SPEAKER_01]: capillary force.
[SPEAKER_01]: The small pores they retain the water very
well and so they facilitate both water and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient retention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're concerned for example about
leaching we like to see these nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: being retained in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a question for you here,
actually two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one is which soil has a higher
leaching potential, a sand, a silt or a
[SPEAKER_01]: clay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second question is which soil has
a higher runoff and denitrification
[SPEAKER_01]: potential, the gaseous losses of nitrogen,
the sand, the silt or the clay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you all got this question
just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's of course the sand that has the
highest leaching potential because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly large pores, doesn't retain the
water and the nutrients very well so they
[SPEAKER_01]: easily wash out with the percolating water
and for two it's of course the clay that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a higher runoff potential,
mostly small pores so not very good
[SPEAKER_01]: infiltration capacity and because it is
mostly small pores the aeration can often
[SPEAKER_01]: become a problem when you get a lot of
water and so you have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: denitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure you all got those answers
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go back to our textural
triangle again so we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: more sandy soils like a sand, a loamy
sand, sandy loam, a lot of large pores,
[SPEAKER_01]: high leaching potential, when we have
higher clay contents we tend to have
[SPEAKER_01]: higher runoff and denitrification
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's look at things a little bit more
in a landscape perspective and we often
[SPEAKER_01]: use the term hydrologically sensitive
areas for parts of the landscape that have
[SPEAKER_01]: a high potential for pollutant losses and
in some cases we're concerned about runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: surface losses, in other cases it's
leaching and subsurface recharge losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do we in the landscape have high
runoff losses?
[SPEAKER_01]: In flood plains and this is kind of an
interesting scenario because most flood
[SPEAKER_01]: plains actually tend to have relatively
coarse textured soils like gravels or kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of sandy soils that you might say well
they have high infiltration capacity but
[SPEAKER_01]: because they are located near a stream
basically if you get heavy rains and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get flooding then basically everything
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have not a lot of nutrients on the
soil or the soil is very poorly protected
[SPEAKER_01]: then a lot of that gets lost and in the
northeast we certainly experienced that
[SPEAKER_01]: this year with a hurricane and a follow-up
in parts of the northeast with some other
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similarly areas that are adjacent to
flowing or standing water bodies are
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrologically sensitive primarily because
they tend to be wetter areas in the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape and because they are close to
these water bodies so there's very little
[SPEAKER_01]: buffer, very little opportunity to filter
out some of these contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Areas with low infiltration capacity are a
concern maybe because the soil has become
[SPEAKER_01]: compacted or sometimes it's even when it's
adjacent to say a road or some other
[SPEAKER_01]: compacted area where the runoff that comes
off that area then goes on to a field and
[SPEAKER_01]: may reduce runoff and erosion on the field
and then areas generally that are
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated that are already wet have a high
runoff potential as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so let's then think about the
leaching and subsurface recharge areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that we're mostly concerned about
are areas that are close to either wells
[SPEAKER_01]: or springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are typically areas that have very
permeable soils and when you're very close
[SPEAKER_01]: to these water sources that people use for
drinking water we need to be extra careful
[SPEAKER_01]: and so those are sensitive areas and in
general areas with very permeable soils
[SPEAKER_01]: are also of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to think a little bit in terms
of the location that a field or a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: might have in the landscape and so going
back to my earlier presentation from a few
[SPEAKER_01]: months ago we talked about soil survey
reports and how useful that information is
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're using the paper copies with
the traditional maps or whether you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the online version the so-called web soil
survey which is just a fantastic tool it
[SPEAKER_01]: provides you with information on basic
soil properties on suitability for use and
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case also the environmental loss
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil survey can be a very good sort
of first source of information to start
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about these problems and how to
address them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so let's look at one of the concerns
that we have and that's erosion and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's two aspects of erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: that are undesirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it removes the good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It removes the soil right from the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically the soil that's the highest
in organic matter and it's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable and what it leaves behind
typically is the kind of the gravelly
[SPEAKER_01]: material the coarse fragments that don't
get washed away as easily by the runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with many years of erosion we basically
lose our best soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other aspect of course is that the
soil ends up somewhere else as sediment
[SPEAKER_01]: and this pollutes water resources where it
streams or eventually going into lakes or
[SPEAKER_01]: estuaries or rivers and this this covers
aquatic habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it less suitable for drinking
water or even navigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of these aspects of course are
highly undesirable and erosion really
[SPEAKER_01]: remains a large problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the United States we still have a
lot of concerns about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a number of factors that affect
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil type and slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically soils that have a high runoff
potential also have higher erosion
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steeper slopes of course are of greater
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil health can be a big factor as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we basically build the soil up with say
good aggregation good plant rooting that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know pumps the water out very well we
are going to be reducing the erosion
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also surface management you know
whether we keep the soil covered or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's exposed using tillage or you
know herbicides or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can greatly influence the erosion
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a quick illustration of that
that shows these four graphs in different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of the development of erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the top left we see a raindrop and a
raindrop actually has a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy basically from its mass and its
velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It then reaches the land surface and that
is basically what initially creates the
[SPEAKER_01]: concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the soil is dry it is relatively hard
and initially resilient and can absorb the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy of that raindrop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the soil starts to wet up it
becomes soft and it becomes weaker and the
[SPEAKER_01]: raindrop energy cannot be absorbed quite
as well to the point where that surface
[SPEAKER_01]: layer becomes very soft and very
susceptible to the energy of the raindrop
[SPEAKER_01]: which may cause then the aggregates or the
soil itself to be smashed and dispersed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that here in the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the very soft soil and you can
actually see the impact of the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: raindrops that basically destroy the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start to see water accumulating at the
surface and if this is on even a modest
[SPEAKER_01]: slope you start to initiate runoff and
then erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one thing we could do is of course we
could try to cover that soil with say
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch or you know some other type of say
organic compound, maybe even some compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and that material, that surface cover can
then absorb the energy of the raindrops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of it falling directly onto the
soil it's being absorbed by say the mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: and this greatly, greatly reduces the
erosion potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the best things we can do to
reduce erosion is to have the soil covered
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's depicted here in this you know
rather famous graph that shows the
[SPEAKER_01]: relative erosion or soil loss from 0 to
100% and the percentage service residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have bare soil we have losses at
100% but we see then a fairly rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease in the erosion loss even with
modest amounts of service residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have about 30% service residue we
reduce the erosion losses by about 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: from 100 to 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we increase the amount of
service residue in the end we end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively low erosion losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the best things we can do in
terms of reducing erosion losses is to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover the soil and the good thing is this
also has a lot of benefits in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: building healthy soils to reduce the
effects of extreme water and temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions at the surface to promote
biological activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to some extent it is a no-brainer to
put mulch or other materials on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of erosion and runoff then
what are sort of the main strategies?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know in summary avoid fields that are
prone to flooding or have high runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: potential if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the soil covered with mulch or
residue or even compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build and maintain soil health especially
aggregation to increase infiltration
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity and reduce the runoff potential
and then use grass alleyways preferably
[SPEAKER_01]: along the contour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some pictures here this shows
of course the surface mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also soil that has received
compost and so it's in really good shape
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the soil that you see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture that shows these
alleyways that in the wintertime will have
[SPEAKER_01]: a rye cover crop and this can then be
mowed onto the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case we have grapes here in South
Africa but we can use that then as a mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: to go into the into the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you can bring in external
sources of mulch as well and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom picture shows you a grass alleyway
especially if it's along the contour
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good because it will infiltrate
water quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will filter out any sediment that might
come from the rows if they are
[SPEAKER_01]: unprotected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some good management
approaches that are really not difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: to implement and in fact are being
implemented by most berry growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so let's continue on and now talk
about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early seminar we discussed the nine
what we call macro elements, the elements
[SPEAKER_01]: that plants need in relatively large
quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are
available plentiful in the natural world
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's primarily the nitrogen and the
phosphorus that are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: applied in large quantities but are also
of environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we'll be focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this pictograph shows the difference in
loss pathways between nitrogen here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top versus phosphorus on the bottom and
although they are both nutrients they
[SPEAKER_01]: behave very differently in the soil and
they have very different impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll discuss those in some more
detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen can be in the soil in both
organic or inorganic form as nitrate and
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the nitrogen we hope will be taken
up by the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's our objective and that
promotes good growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may run off or erode but typically with
nitrogen that's a relatively insignificant
[SPEAKER_01]: loss pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly the leaching and the
volatilization and denitrification that
[SPEAKER_01]: are the primary loss pathways and so those
are the ones that we are concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both initiated by very wet soil
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now phosphorus on the other hand can be in
the soil also in organic and mineral form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again the desired pathway is crop uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaching is only a problem in some very
rare cases where there's just excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts, usually excessive amounts of
phosphorus in the soil where we're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with very sandy soil with shallow water
tables but in most cases it's really the
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff and the erosion that's a primary
concern with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at each of these in a little
bit more detail starting with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our pictograph again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's primarily the runoff and the
erosion that's of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a picture from a lake in Canada
with a barrier in between that shows the
[SPEAKER_01]: area that receives phosphorus inputs and
the area that did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the freshwater lakes in North
America are phosphorus limited and it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually takes relatively little
phosphorus to induce eutrophication or
[SPEAKER_01]: algae growth or even aquatic vegetation
and this is to some extent the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: process but it gets accelerated by
phosphorus that comes from farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again berry farms are probably not a huge
contributor but they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute with poor management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well one thing we need to keep in mind
because erosion and runoff are the primary
[SPEAKER_01]: processes for phosphorus losses then you
know from that of course it's a logical
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusion to say practices that reduce
runoff and erosion also reduce phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: losses and so you know having surface
mulch, improving infiltration capacity
[SPEAKER_01]: through good soil health management,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: these are all practices that also reduce
phosphorus losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's another dimension to that and
that's basically the accumulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we end up with lots and lots of
phosphorus in the soil then we increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the loss potential and that's an
additional concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just think about phosphorus
levels in terms of a soil test level which
[SPEAKER_01]: we of course measure on a regular basis we
know that if the soil test levels are very
[SPEAKER_01]: low that we have reductions in yield and
that there is sort of a point where you
[SPEAKER_01]: say well there's sufficient phosphorus in
the soil for good crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have sort of an optimum range but then
if we really get too much phosphorus in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil then we have excess and this
excess phosphorus is much more susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: to loss losses through runoff and erosion
and that's a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the above graph is basically kind of a
hypothetical case.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bottom here I'm showing you some
real data of relative yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for corn and alfalfa and grass but
it shows you that in this case for a
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan extractable pea that if you're sort
of in this range of four to six that's
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of where the cutoff is between going
from below optimum to optimum and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any yield increase beyond that
but then at some point in time you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to get into excessive levels and
even though the response to soil pea
[SPEAKER_01]: levels is often quite somewhat variable
and low precision there is really strong
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement that these levels that there is
a certain level where you really have an
[SPEAKER_01]: optimum amount of phosphorus in the soil
not deficient and not excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to show you as a
comparison because many of you may be
[SPEAKER_01]: using different extractants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the northeast we mostly use
modified Morgan which is just like Morgan
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly in terms of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may be using Olson or Bray or
Malik 1 or Malik 3 and this here shows the
[SPEAKER_01]: different ranges because the extractants
are slightly different and they end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with extracting a little bit more,
a little bit less phosphorus depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the method and so they each have their
ranges in terms of low, optimum,
[SPEAKER_01]: high and very high and it's under the very
high where we get to be concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive phosphorus losses and so we
would like to be able to prevent that from
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to have too much phosphorus
in the soil that will possibly cause
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in most cases if a farmer regularly
soil tests and is very careful about how
[SPEAKER_01]: much they apply you don't really see any
problems with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cases where you do see that occurring
is typically with a lot of organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that with manure especially say
on a dairy farm that has a lot of excess
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients then that builds up the
phosphorus or we also see it sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: with you know repeated compost
applications sometimes with even with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic farms because both manure and
compost are not as well balanced in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of nitrogen and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is that you typically apply too much
phosphorus for what the crop needs if you
[SPEAKER_01]: apply the right amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do this year after year and then
you start to build up your phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some some real soil samples
of cases where there's been an increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of organic phosphorus applied and
these are then for malic or for margarine
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil test levels and you can see that
they really build up and they are really
[SPEAKER_01]: highly excessive which is really what we
would like to like to prevent from
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a situation like that when
you have too much phosphorus in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: then you need to make sure that you change
the diet you might say of the soil where
[SPEAKER_01]: you add your nitrogen in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps you can do that by adding say
clover residues or alfalfa or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not an organic grower then perhaps you can
simply apply some nitrogen fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_01]: a smaller amount of compost so that you
can start reducing those phosphorus levels
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we account for that in the Cornell
soil health test in terms of the scoring
[SPEAKER_01]: curve that we use for phosphorus analysis
and that was discussed in the previous
[SPEAKER_01]: webinars by Bob Schindelbeck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the scoring curve basically the idea is
that we interpret and actually measured
[SPEAKER_01]: value of a soil health indicator in this
case phosphorus and we interpret that on a
[SPEAKER_01]: scale from basically 0 to 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have very low phosphorus levels
then we give it a very low score and as
[SPEAKER_01]: the phosphorus level increased and we
increase the score as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and this is then where we around 4 to 6
where we reach the optimum level but then
[SPEAKER_01]: we start to downscore it basically when we
start to reach excessive levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is important that that you try to
keep your phosphorus levels sort of in
[SPEAKER_01]: this optimum range so sort of between
about 4 or 5 and about 20 and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to go into excessive levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to summarize the phosphorus management
what are the main strategies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the first four that we see here are
the same as we used for runoff and erosion
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention okay because if you don't get
any runoff then you don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same one avoid high flooding
locations keep the soil covered maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: soil health and maintain grass alleyways
but now we have this fifth consideration
[SPEAKER_01]: is monitor the soil phosphorus levels and
try to avoid excessive phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these five management strategies are
very effective in reducing P losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so we've talked about erosion we've
talked about phosphorus now let's talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about nitrogen and nitrogen is a very kind
of complex element in the soil and both in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of how it behaves in the soil but
also in terms of the larger considerations
[SPEAKER_01]: around nitrogen and there's a there's a
number of concerns that we have about
[SPEAKER_01]: around nitrogen these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the is the high energy consumption
that's associated with the Haber-Bosch
[SPEAKER_01]: process that basically is the industrial
process that takes atmospheric nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_01]: reactive nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a lot of natural gas a lot of
energy and it generates a lot of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly you know we have a persisting
concern about groundwater nitrate levels
[SPEAKER_01]: we haven't really seen a lot of
improvements in general over the past
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of decades in nitrate levels which
is the results of excess of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: applications especially in these more
sandy areas or even urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one that we're concerned about
is is the losses of nitrogen into streams
[SPEAKER_01]: and rivers and then into estuaries and
this map here on the bottom shows the the
[SPEAKER_01]: about 300 locations around the world where
there are a lot of concerns with high
[SPEAKER_01]: level of nitrogen in estuaries causing
hypoxia or low oxygen levels and fish
[SPEAKER_01]: kills and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One area that's really quite well known is
northwestern Europe where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen used a lot of intensive dairying
this is the original area of where the
[SPEAKER_01]: dairy systems were developed and then of
course in North America the area along the
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast starting sort of with southern
New England going down to Florida and then
[SPEAKER_01]: of course along the Gulf Coast where we
have probably the largest problem as a
[SPEAKER_01]: result of all the nitrogen that comes out
of the Mississippi River basin primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with with corn production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are often very important
estuaries like for example the Beconic Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: on Long Island where there's a lot of
concerns even from horticultural farms
[SPEAKER_01]: about trying to reduce nitrogen losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fourth area of concern is is
greenhouse gas primarily nitrous oxide N2O
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the result of denitrification and
again dairy production may not be a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: contributor but agriculture overall has a
very large footprint in terms of of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse gas impact actually very
disproportionate to the share of the gross
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic product about seven to eight
percent of greenhouse gases are associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with agriculture and most of that is
nitrous oxide losses because nitrous oxide
[SPEAKER_01]: is about 300 times more potent than carbon
dioxide and and so we need to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce that through prudent and judicious
nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go to our pictograph here about
about nitrogen again crop uptake is
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable we may have a little runoff in
erosion but most of the losses will be
[SPEAKER_01]: leaching or denitrification if we have you
know a more sandy gravel soil most of it
[SPEAKER_01]: will be through leaching and this is as
nitrate because nitrate is negatively
[SPEAKER_01]: charged and the soil is negatively charged
as well so therefore it very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: percolates down and washes down with with
the water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The volatilization and denitrification
losses are primarily N2 which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen gas that's also in the atmosphere
which is not at all a concern because 78%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the atmosphere is already dinitrogen
gas but it's the nitrous oxide that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: primary concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when we have a denitrification event
from say heavy rain we may actually lose
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit of nitrogen we may easily use
30-40 pounds of nitrogen per acre either
[SPEAKER_01]: through denitrification or through
leaching with a heavy rainfall event of
[SPEAKER_01]: say an inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other component that I should mention
is volatilization of ammonia that is also
[SPEAKER_01]: a concern primarily with acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the the nitrogen cycle of course is
is relatively complex and I won't go into
[SPEAKER_01]: detail about that it's I think the main
point is that there's a lot of these these
[SPEAKER_01]: transformations that occur in the soil
that are in part driven by all these
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of nitrogen that come you know
from agriculture and when it moves from
[SPEAKER_01]: one state to the other state it may be
become subject to leaching or
[SPEAKER_01]: denitrification and gaseous losses and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to simplify that by using
this graph here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first shows the sources of soil
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is we get a little bit of
nitrogen from the atmosphere typically
[SPEAKER_01]: about maybe six or eight pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free nitrogen basically but a
relatively small quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most field conditions we get a
significant amount of the nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_01]: the mineralization or basically the
decomposition of soil organic matter that
[SPEAKER_01]: may be native in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other organic materials that may have been
applied like manure or compost or residues
[SPEAKER_01]: and then cover crops especially leguminous
cover crops like clover or alfalfa and
[SPEAKER_01]: these all get get decomposed and the
organic nitrogen is mineralized to
[SPEAKER_01]: inorganic nitrogen primarily as a result
of you know biological processes which are
[SPEAKER_01]: in turn affected by temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other source of nitrogen of course is
mineral nitrogen which is which is
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be ammonia type fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be nitrates type fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all these different sources of
variation that are associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen availability and that makes it
actually a little bit more difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We different soil types have different
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at the Midwestern soil
they have a lot of organic matter and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very deep and they have good structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide a lot more nitrogen than say
a soil in the northeast that's very sandy
[SPEAKER_01]: and a pot soil type soil that has
relatively little organic matter and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen mineralization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course the amount of organic matter in
the soil affects the nitrogen availability
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have seen soils you know build up
organic matter when they're very well
[SPEAKER_01]: managed or lose organic matter when they
are say have a history of intensive
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage or erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course how much you add in addition in
terms of organic amendments like compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and manure whether you have cover crops
and what types of cover crops leguminous
[SPEAKER_01]: versus grass cover crops for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil and crop management you know how
intensively you till and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you have drainage or not and if
you have poor drainage then you may get a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of losses especially of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature is a factor because a lot of
the mineralization is temperature mediated
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a biological process and then
of course last but not least precipitation
[SPEAKER_01]: because a soil that's say very dry will
not mineralize nitrogen or soil that's too
[SPEAKER_01]: wet won't mineralize nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these things in a way interact in
very complex ways and that's what makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: very difficult to precisely predict how
much nitrogen needs to be added to your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to adequately feed the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are really some some guidelines
that we have if we understand the system a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this picture here shows the nitrogen
mineralization as part of the incubation
[SPEAKER_01]: time this is from an earlier paper by
Casman and Mons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it shows you here that the most
of the nitrogen comes from the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 0 to 18 centimeters which is
about 0 to 7 inches and we see the an
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing amount of nitrogen being
mineralized over incubation time up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the square root it's a hundred
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see that as we go deeper into
the soil less and less nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralized and becomes available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the surface soil that's the most
important that provides the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the field and this is a laboratory
study but in the field nitrogen release
[SPEAKER_01]: will be affected by weather conditions
like temperature, soil organic minor
[SPEAKER_01]: contents, soil types, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's now consider the losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at the sources of N and these
are the primary losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is ammonia volatilization and
that can be the result of the application
[SPEAKER_01]: of ammonia type fertilizers especially if
they are left right at the soil surface so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can volatilize and you can
reduce that by basically incorporating it
[SPEAKER_01]: or injecting it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also manure can often have ammonia
fertilization so if you apply manure or
[SPEAKER_01]: even some compost and you leave it on the
surface then you might lose some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: through volatilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little bit about runoff and
erosion tends to be not that big of a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary losses of nitrogen from runoff
and erosion is when you leave the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: or inorganic fertilizer on the surface and
it gets removed in a heavy rainfall of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other losses, the major losses are
denitrification and nitrate leaching as we
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again the primary objective of course
remains getting the nitrogen into the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again it's management, soil health,
precipitation and temperature that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: critical factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the losses it's always if you
get a lot of water, you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: precipitation that creates most of the
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can create the leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denitrification is affected by both
precipitation and by temperature because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an indirect loss and it's a
biologically mediated loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have actually very cold soil you
may have quite a bit of nitrogen in that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil but you won't get much
denitrification losses because the soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: cold and the biological activity is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you really do see a lot of
denitrification losses is sort of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit further into the growing
season when the soil has become warm and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you get a lot of rain and you can
lose easily 30 to 50 pounds per acre in a
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a way you'd like to be able to
account for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go back to our basic properties
in terms of pore sizes we can think of the
[SPEAKER_01]: loss potential again in terms of large
pores, good air generation so it reduces
[SPEAKER_01]: denitrification losses, small pores
reduces leaching losses and ideally you
[SPEAKER_01]: have some of both because that provides a
well-balanced soil which you tend to get
[SPEAKER_01]: from a well-aggregated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another concern related to nitrogen is
pore internal drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have barriers deep in the soil
and you have water tables that are at you
[SPEAKER_01]: know relatively shallow depths that
promotes of course denitrification losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can remediate that through insulation
of subsurface drain lines and of course
[SPEAKER_01]: raised beds also reduces susceptibility to
imperfect drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a component that's often forgotten
but you know pore drainage creates
[SPEAKER_01]: problems especially with nitrogen losses
but even with runoff and erosion and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus losses because soils that have
pore drainage tend to have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for runoff because the soil
remains wet and saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the main strategies then for
reducing nitrogen losses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not over apply nitrogen by accounting
for all sources of nitrogen inputs like
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil organic matter, compost,
manure, fertilizer, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally provide nitrogen in multiple
applications and account for weather
[SPEAKER_01]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually on the scientific front
making a lot of progress in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have for field corn and sweet corn
we have a tool that we developed the
[SPEAKER_01]: ADAPT-N tool that allows for prediction of
how much nitrogen you need using model
[SPEAKER_01]: simulations accounting for all these
weather effects that we discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for even for berry producers
where you may not have a tool like that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have basic rules of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have say a very wet spring then you
probably lost some of that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: through denitrification and leaching
depending on your soil type and you may
[SPEAKER_01]: need to make up for that and apply a
little bit of extra nitrogen say in your
[SPEAKER_01]: second application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a relatively dry spring
you may want to do the opposite because
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't have any losses so you don't
want to over apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can even you know without really
using sophisticated sophisticated methods
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make some adjustments to your
nitrogen based on the weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one build and maintain soil health,
aggregation, organic matter, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: That especially on the medium to fine
textured soils will help with aeration and
[SPEAKER_01]: with water and nutrient retention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil health management again it's
important not only from a production
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective but also in terms of reducing
the environmental losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally as I mentioned facilitate
good drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to show you these two soil
health reports and to look at that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: in the context of the environmental loss
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are two very similar soils but
one had a history of no manure inputs and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other one had a history with manure
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though these soils inherently are
very similar they're medium textured soils
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can see that the aggregate
stability without manure was 53% but it
[SPEAKER_01]: became 78% with multiple manure inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have actually made the soil more
desirable by allowing for better aeration
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced potential for denitrification
losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The available water capacity went from 0.1
to 0.26 so we've increased the ability of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil to retain the nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've both reduced the denitrification
losses in principle and we've reduced the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaching losses because we have better
water and nutrient retention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also notice that the organic matter
content without manure was 2.6 and with
[SPEAKER_01]: manure it's been built up to over 6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has a lot of benefits similar with
the active carbon and potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralizable nitrogen that's an indicator
of the amount of nitrogen that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: expect from mineralization that went from
about 6 to about 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this soil on the right of course
can provide a lot more nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_01]: natural sources than the one on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all in all the one on the right with
the manure inputs is of higher health,
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quality and presumably reduced
environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so this is then my last slide where I
want to put everything together that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed in the past hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think first and foremost most berry
production systems have low environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts from nutrients and sediments and
part of that is because they that is
[SPEAKER_01]: inherent with the production practice and
the fact that you're using a perennial
[SPEAKER_01]: plant so there's not a lot of tillage
going on, there's not very large amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: of nutrients that normally get applied and
so it's not as big of a concern as perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: you know corn production or some of these
other major crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Size characteristics like soil type
location etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: can affect potential losses like for
example when you're on the flood plain or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you have very clay soils and you
know naturally soils that have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff and erosion potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that through management we
can increase or decrease the potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: these losses leaching or runoff and
erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we build up the soil through good
soil health management we can increase
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity and reduce the environmental
impact so it's a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in addition we need to make sure
that we don't put too many nutrients out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that we are careful about what we
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So prudent nutrient management can prevent
most of these losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that I will hand it over or back
to Laura to our moderator and be happy to
[SPEAKER_01]: entertain questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Tom has a question about
whether or not the soil health test that
[SPEAKER_00]: you showed second to the last slide was
with manure from a corn silage field and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I actually had some questions about
that same slide so I don't know would it
[SPEAKER_00]: be possible to go back to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes we can go back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I mean the soil on the right they were
both soils that were in corn production
[SPEAKER_01]: and the one on the left was primarily corn
for grain and the one on the right was
[SPEAKER_01]: part of a dairy system so it was corn
silage with manure inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay hopefully that answers Tom's question
and my question may be a little bit off
[SPEAKER_00]: topic from the berry example but I'm just
wondering about the root health rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle a little bit with the soil
health test trying to understand what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and definitely I can see the
positive impact that manure has but why is
[SPEAKER_00]: the root health rating lower do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to go back to all the details
about the particular farm which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably has to do with the fact that
the field that received the manure inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: also had rotations with alfalfa and we
used the bean bioassay for to look at the,
[SPEAKER_01]: so let me just put the arrow there,
we used a bean bioassay which is also a
[SPEAKER_01]: legume so we may have increased the root
disease pressure a little bit simply by
[SPEAKER_01]: the rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically the rotation and the types
of crops that are part of the rotation
[SPEAKER_01]: that are the primary concern but keep in
mind that we use a, for the root health
[SPEAKER_01]: rating we use a sensitive indicator crop
which is which is snap bean basically that
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what we use in comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you're not growing snap beans of
course then you need to understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know your crop might have slightly
different susceptibility but we selected
[SPEAKER_01]: snap bean because you know it is the best
indicator typically that you can use for
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay great thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's a couple of other
folks typing and maybe we can get some
[SPEAKER_00]: other questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy wonders how long does the effect of
a heavy downpour persist in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen losses to soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an hour or so after the event or a
day or more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay good question Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so if you, it takes a little bit
longer, it takes several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have a more finer textured soils
like a silt loam down to a clay loam you
[SPEAKER_01]: know when we get a lot of rainfall the
soil becomes saturated and if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: drain well then the soil remains saturated
and then it takes about two days in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: we've done a lot of research on that and
taken a lot of measures it takes about 48
[SPEAKER_01]: to 72 hours then for these anaerobic
conditions to occur and that's when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get most of the losses so it's not
immediate because the soil needs to remain
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated for about two days for the EH or
the redox potential to go down and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when you get most of the losses and
similarly with leaching losses it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: about a day or so, day or two for the
water to move down through the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: then to wash out most of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay great and then there is another
question from Glenn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's wondering if the additional traffic
from manure applications increased the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface and subsurface hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's referring to that very slide
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes absolutely and we do see this a lot on
dairy farms where the soil health
[SPEAKER_01]: indicators are all looking great you know
it's all in the green and the ratings are
[SPEAKER_01]: very high in the 90s and then we see that
the hardness is typically the soil is very
[SPEAKER_01]: hard and so the score is very low on that
and that's because on these fields that
[SPEAKER_01]: receive manure a lot of the manure gets
applied with very heavy manure spreaders
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes under very marginal conditions
you know the farmers want to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: manure onto the land early in the season
because they want to get to planting and
[SPEAKER_01]: so a lot of these soils actually show a
lot of compaction problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's very observant of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again from Glenn he's wondering
if there's relationships between
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and precipitation have been
condensed into interpretive rules by which
[SPEAKER_00]: one could apply observed and forecasted
weather data into ADAPT-N recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see now I need to look at that
really quickly myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been condensed into interpretive
forecast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes so if you're interested in ADAPT-N I
would encourage you to just go to our
[SPEAKER_01]: website if you just Google ADAPT-N you
will get there but the ADAPT-N system is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically it involves a dynamic simulation
model which simulates soil and crop
[SPEAKER_01]: processes like water movement through the
soil and nitrogen transformation and it
[SPEAKER_01]: also accesses a high-resolution weather
database that was developed here at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast Climate Center right here in the
same building where I am now Bradfield
[SPEAKER_01]: Hall and so the ADAPT-N tool basically
simulates all these conditions for the
[SPEAKER_01]: early part of the growing season it
estimates the nitrogen additions through
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralization and all that and it
estimates the losses and then it comes up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a recommendation for sight dressing
in this case corn in principle you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: could also get into other crops so but
that's what it does it's very dynamic and
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes all of those temperature and
precipitation factors into account and it
[SPEAKER_01]: does it in a kind of a daily time step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and then there's a question from Tom
he's wondering if there's any new research
[SPEAKER_00]: on remediating compaction, mechanical
ripping or bio-drilling with a deep-rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: crop like forage, radish or alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well yeah Tom I mean those are of course
some of the things that more recently have
[SPEAKER_01]: been developed I think the bio-drilling is
very exciting this is for those of you who
[SPEAKER_01]: are not familiar with it Ray Weil at the
University of Maryland has done a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work on that often in collaboration with
Steve Groff who is a very progressive
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer in southeastern Pennsylvania the
idea is to use you know radishes
[SPEAKER_01]: especially you can plant them in September
typically for most of the areas that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned of and they establish very
strong and fat roots I mean they're
[SPEAKER_01]: radishes and that basically kind of
loosens up the soil we call it
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-drilling and yeah so if you have
compaction the best way to address that is
[SPEAKER_01]: to find some way to decompact and it could
be through bio-drilling it could also be
[SPEAKER_01]: simply through you know some limited and
targeted tillage and then to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent that from happening through you
know soil health management practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter additions and all that you
know the soil becomes more resilient to
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction and more resistant if you have
you know better aggregation and better air
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange and all those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so those are some of the areas you
know we we've talked in the past about you
[SPEAKER_01]: know using frost tillage as well that you
know wouldn't be that appropriate for
[SPEAKER_01]: berry production but it's you know you
basically till the soil when it has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: shallow frozen surface and that can be you
know if there's been a lot of compaction
[SPEAKER_01]: that occurred in the fall that can be a
way to alleviate the compaction that way
[SPEAKER_01]: and you do that at you know particular
time windows during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and then Kathy has two related
questions she's wondering if there is then
[SPEAKER_00]: a short-term and or long-term residual
effect on nitrogen availability after the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy rain event she's going back to that
question initially that she asked and then
[SPEAKER_00]: if nitrogen is applied after the heavy
rain event is it more susceptible to loss
[SPEAKER_00]: if another event follows?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not necessarily a residual effect
that I'm aware of and so if you have such
[SPEAKER_01]: a heavy rainfall event you lose a certain
amount of the nitrogen you know so if most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the nitrogen that's in the soil is in a
nitrate form so the most reactive form
[SPEAKER_01]: then you will lose a significant amount of
that with a big rainfall event either
[SPEAKER_01]: through leaching or through
denitrification and then it's gone and you
[SPEAKER_01]: won't get it back basically then there's
no necessarily not a residual effect per
[SPEAKER_01]: se other than that the soil is at that
point in time quite wet so if you get
[SPEAKER_01]: another rainfall event you know say four
days later and the soil is already wet
[SPEAKER_01]: then of course you can go into another
leaching or denitrification event but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you apply the nitrogen you know subsequent
to these events and not immediately but
[SPEAKER_01]: say you know a week later or something
like that then in principle that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: being impacted by what happened to the
previous nitrogen and that is a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: make up for some of these losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I think does anyone else have
any questions for Dr. Van Ness?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right they're pretty quiet I'll just
move into the exit screen I want to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Harold Van Ness for being with us
today and I want to remind the the group
[SPEAKER_00]: that remains that the speaker for the next
webinar is Dr. Belinsky Santos who is the
[SPEAKER_00]: assistant professor of horticulture at the
University of Florida and the topic will
[SPEAKER_00]: be fertigation and hydroponics of
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll talk about new diagnostic tools and
precision agriculture for berry crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again if you have not completed the
demographics questionnaire or the pretest
[SPEAKER_00]: please take an opportunity to do that
right now and I want to thank all of you
[SPEAKER_00]: for joining us and we will see you the
next webinar is March 2nd so we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks break and then we'll be
back on March 2nd and March 9th finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: again with Dr. Van Ness and thank you.
you
