[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate the invitation to talk
with you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'd like to focus on is mitigating
wildlife damage in cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about some basic principles of
wildlife damage management, whether you're
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with birds and mammals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to go through results of a
survey we had a few years ago to give you
[SPEAKER_03]: a sense of the magnitude of the impacts
that deer and other wildlife cause in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll dive right into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dennis Slate summarized integrated
wildlife damage management pretty clearly
[SPEAKER_03]: at a conference several years ago,
and it comes down to a very simple
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kill them, you can scare them,
you can put up a barrier, or you can spray
[SPEAKER_03]: a chemical that may or may not work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's integrated wildlife damage
management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can all go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really, you don't have a lot of
options when you're dealing with most of
[SPEAKER_03]: these critters, and they can cause
significant economic impacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some keys I've seen over the
years of multiple species, multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: cropping systems that tend to lead to
success in an integrated wildlife
[SPEAKER_03]: management program.
[SPEAKER_03]: First and most important is timing,
knowing when and where the damage is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to occur and making sure you get up your
control strategies, whatever you choose to
[SPEAKER_03]: use, out in a timely fashion before the
damage gets too severe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once wildlife develop a feeding habit,
it's really difficult to break that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can sort of know that,
hey, my blueberries are starting to get
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh, turning color, the sugar content's
going up, I better get my netting on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before those birds start feeding,
you can have more success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diversity is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to know what different tools
and techniques are out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes combining tools works,
sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll share some data with you about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Persistence is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not something you do once and walk
away from.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be successful, most of the tools and
techniques we have require continued,
[SPEAKER_03]: often daily, attention in some cases to
moving things around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Filling gas generators to make sure you've
got electrical power to electrical powered
[SPEAKER_03]: unit or making sure your batteries are up
on your solar powered units.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then monitoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to know what's working,
when and where, and is what I'm paying for
[SPEAKER_03]: wildlife control benefiting me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times, particularly some bird
data I'll show you later on, it probably
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't pay for what most of the growers
are doing for bird control except in
[SPEAKER_03]: certain conditions where you've got low
crop yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most wildlife leaves signs to the
president.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's often easy to identify who the
culprit is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, you can see the deer
tracks up in the corn ears or deer damaged
[SPEAKER_03]: apple trees or nursery crops are really
easy to identify because deer have lower
[SPEAKER_03]: incisors and upper hard palate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have upper and lower incisors
like rodents, so they don't leave a clean
[SPEAKER_03]: bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they bite on something, they leave
this ragged torn edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's usually pretty easy to identify
deer damage versus rodent damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned the survey of deer damage to
agriculture in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: I partnered with Tommy Brown and Dan
Decker, folks with the Experiment Station
[SPEAKER_03]: Farm Bureau a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we wanted to estimate deer damage by
crop type and region.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to look at how growers were
using DEC deer damage permits that are
[SPEAKER_03]: available to help them alleviate crop
damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we wanted to compare what the
magnitude of deer damage is versus other
[SPEAKER_03]: wildlife damage that they're seeing on
their farms across the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used a database, a farm maintained
by Ag and Markets, the New York Ag
[SPEAKER_03]: Statistics Service, and developed and
implemented a mail questionnaire to 3,909
[SPEAKER_03]: farms across New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: We targeted 500 per agricultural region.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up with 909 because there weren't
500 farms on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were only 409.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hit all the farms across the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our sample pool was 25,497 farms across
the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to meet our criteria, a farm had to
have at least $1,000 in reported sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we included all farms that were not
exclusively like bees and honey
[SPEAKER_03]: aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, you had to have a field
crop growing of some type that wildlife
[SPEAKER_03]: like deer could potentially damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a fantastic response rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to most mail surveys nowadays
with about a 50% response rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got 1,927 questionnaires returned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think we've got really good data,
at least old data, what the impacts were.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also followed up with a phone call to
100 non-respondents to look at did their
[SPEAKER_03]: damage differ at all from those 50% of
people who returned the surveys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found that by far the
non-respondents had less damage and
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller acreages of farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So based on a formula, we down adjusted
the raw damage reports by 31.5% that count
[SPEAKER_03]: for the non-respondent bias in the survey
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, these are probably relatively
good statistics given the sample size that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably familiar with all the New York
State ag regions in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you a few tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so data are broken down by
agricultural region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see there are some patterns
that emerge.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of total number of farms and
sales, again, from that pool of 25,500
[SPEAKER_03]: farms, roughly 60% of the farms reported
values and sales between 10 and 250,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: No big surprise there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was interesting, if you look at the
proportion of farms that reported more
[SPEAKER_03]: than $250,000 in sales, the highest
percentage by far was on Long Island with
[SPEAKER_03]: one in five farms reporting more than
250,000 in sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lowest percentage was in the
southern tier with only 8% of farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: reporting more than 250,000 sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the big farming regions are western
New York, southern tier, and central New
[SPEAKER_03]: York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, no big surprise there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at total estimated damage by
deer that was reported by the growers
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up being almost $59 million a year
statewide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about a fairly
substantial economic impact to the farm
[SPEAKER_03]: industry in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: By far, in terms of acreage and reported
damage, 23% of that total was in grain
[SPEAKER_03]: crops or $13.6 million in losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look combined alfalfa and other hay
crops, you've got another 24%,
[SPEAKER_03]: another $14.5 million in losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you take grain and hay crop,
you're looking at about half the total
[SPEAKER_03]: damage in the state come from those three
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, again, a significant economic
impact for those farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can even get down to
specialty crops, things like grapes and
[SPEAKER_03]: berries are still $1 to $2 million a year
in losses from wildlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at it regionally and break down
the statistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: By far, western New York has the highest
amount of damage with over $20 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lower Hudson Valley, southeastern
New York has the second highest percent
[SPEAKER_03]: loss with a little over $14.5 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, those are our primary
agricultural regions in the state with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the better quality soils,
lots of farms, lots of cropping systems
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to relate that back to deer
density.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to take this a little bit with
a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally, in western New York,
where the highest damage is, you see the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest deer take.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these wildlife management units
are averaging nine to 16 deer taken per
[SPEAKER_03]: square mile in the wildlife management
units.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got very high deer densities
here that overlap with high crop densities
[SPEAKER_03]: and valuable crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't hold quite as true in lower Hudson
Valley, a little bit lower harvest rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the issue in the lower Hudson Valley
is you've got a lot of suburban
[SPEAKER_03]: development.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though there's a pile of deer there
and there's a fair amount of damage
[SPEAKER_03]: occurring, a lot of those deer aren't
accessible to hunters because of suburban
[SPEAKER_03]: sprawl and suburban development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the average deer take per square mile
is lower, but that doesn't mean there's
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily fewer deer there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then not surprising, the lowest deer
densities in the state are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Adirondack ecoregion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you tend to see more lower levels
of deer damage in northern New York
[SPEAKER_03]: because generally there, you're just maybe
averaging less than 10 deer per square
[SPEAKER_03]: mile in some areas up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked growers on the survey,
what are the top three species on your
[SPEAKER_03]: farm that are responsible for wildlife
damage?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much is it costing you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And 83% of the growers across the state
listed deer in their top three species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we attributed almost half of the total
wildlife damage that occurs statewide
[SPEAKER_03]: caused by deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hence we put a lot of focus on deer and
deer management in our program.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% of growers listed turkeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 15% of the damage was related to
turkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: 21% listed geese, 20 groundhogs,
15% raccoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is sort of the hit list.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the species that are responsible
for most of the damage in agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And listed turkeys and geese specifically,
I'll talk a bit more about birds in
[SPEAKER_03]: general in sort of the second half of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does Department of Environmental
Conservation do?
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got responsibility and authority
for deer management across New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, most of the laws and
regulations are written for managing deer
[SPEAKER_03]: at broad scale, landscape scale at the
state level or the wildlife management.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's deer tags or doe tags are issued
based on an estimated number of deer in a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific wildlife management.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it gets down to farm level impact,
there's really only two things that
[SPEAKER_03]: landowners have available.
[SPEAKER_03]: The deer management assistance program and
deer damage permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are designed to be landowner run
programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll talk a bit more about each of
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by far and away, most of the effort in
the state is at this level, which really
[SPEAKER_03]: may not help growers that are down at the
individual property level.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ask growers, well, do you allow hunting
on your farm?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what type of hunting do you allow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And no big surprise, 83% of growers across
the state do allow deer hunting on their
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But two thirds to three quarters only
allow family, friends and neighbors that
[SPEAKER_03]: they know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been very consistent in many state
surveys that people don't like strangers
[SPEAKER_03]: on their property.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want somebody that they know and they
trust if they're hunting deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those folks may not take enough deer
to have any real impact on crop damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 30% of farmers allow strangers to
hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the 17% of growers that don't provide
any hunting access, they cited problems
[SPEAKER_03]: with liability and past hunter behavior.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most farms don't restrict sex of the deer
taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's an issue I think we've got for
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to have impact on crop
damage, if you're going to reduce deer
[SPEAKER_03]: density, you really got to harvest a lot
of female deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the growth potential of the herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't take female deer and you just
shoot buck, that herd's going to continue
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow because the does are the ones that
are producing the fawns every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only about 9% of growers require that some
does be taken on their farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And opposite of that, 6% of growers only
allow bucks taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want you to shoot does,
which doesn't do a thing to help with crop
[SPEAKER_03]: damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ask growers, are you aware of the deer
management assistance program DEC has?
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you ever used those type of
permits?
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the deer management assistance
program works is the farm land owners fill
[SPEAKER_03]: out an application with DEC usually in
September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then DEC gives the land owner
additional doe tags, antlerless deer tags,
[SPEAKER_03]: for use by hunters on their farm during
the regular open hunting season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they're doing is encouraging
hunters to come onto the farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: take more female deer, hopefully reduce
population growth and hopefully
[SPEAKER_03]: consequently deer damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 31% of growers who responded to our
survey were even aware that this program
[SPEAKER_03]: existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of those that applied for permits,
on average they got seven and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: permits per farm and killed 5.6 deer per
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, those folks that get the permits
do pretty well at filling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see that growers feel that
these do help some in alleviating damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other type of permits, what's called a
deer damage permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers were more familiar with deer
damage permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two-thirds of they had heard of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But only 12% applied for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deer damage permits allow for a grower to
kill deer, usually antlerless,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes bucks, outside of the normal
hunting season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say you're a strawberry grower
and you've got deer coming in in June
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just hammering your crop and you're
afraid you're not going to get your crop
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can apply to DEC for a deer damage
permit and shoot those deer during June if
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to or any time of the year
outside the normal hunting season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also with a damage permit, you can shoot
at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use bait to attract deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do all sorts of things that you
can't do with hunting that you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: written into a deer damage permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been using those the last three
years here on campus to try to alleviate
[SPEAKER_03]: some of our problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be a licensed hunter and
have passed a hunter certification course
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to be at least 21 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, sometimes farmers will get the
permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fill out a form of who your designated
agents are when you apply for the permit
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can have non-farmers, hunters,
friends who are licensed hunters.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're licensed and meet the
requirement, come in and actually do the
[SPEAKER_03]: removal on your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be the landowner.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the application is submitted,
you list your agents that are going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: the shooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most farmers don't have time to do it,
don't do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use their designated agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: On average again, about eight and a half
DEPs were obtained per applicant and seven
[SPEAKER_03]: deer were killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, most people are filling these
permits if they apply for them and they
[SPEAKER_03]: feel they do some good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just sort of to summarize the survey
part of this, deer damage agriculture in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York State is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a high economic impact, particularly
in Western and Southeastern New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grain and nursery crop are the two
highest, but if you had hay in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got substantial forage crop losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most growers allow hunting, but most
growers don't put any restriction on the
[SPEAKER_03]: sex of deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, we're talking with
farm audiences and we talk about deer
[SPEAKER_03]: damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to encourage those farm
landowners to take more female deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The growers who used either the DMAP or
the DDP program, 79% of those growers in
[SPEAKER_03]: the survey said they thought they were at
least somewhat successful in trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce their agriculture problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they solve a problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to solve a problem,
but it might get you through a cropping
[SPEAKER_03]: season.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if you've got something like
strawberry with a very, very narrow
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest window, intensive use of a deer
damage, the deer damage permit for a week
[SPEAKER_03]: or two might get you through that harvest
period where you can get your crop out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I recommend to growers, if you've got
perennial crops and you're in a high deer
[SPEAKER_03]: damage area, things like tree fruits,
nursery crops, eight foot high fencing is
[SPEAKER_03]: the only thing we know really works well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expensive, six bucks a linear foot
installed on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can spend thousands of dollars on a
deer proof fence, but we know that works
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's done properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric fences do work in some
situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to go with a baited electric fence
on a single strand of poly tape or poly
[SPEAKER_03]: wire, get a good high voltage deer
charger, something that's going to put
[SPEAKER_03]: 7,000 to 10,000 line volts out over the
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either use the aluminum foil tab
or peanut butter as a scent attractant,
[SPEAKER_03]: or I prefer using claw strips with a deer
repellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some type of odor in addition to the
electric enhances the effectiveness of the
[SPEAKER_03]: electric fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the peanut butter works is the
deer smells that peanut butter when it
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches the fence and it touches the
fence for the first time with its nose or
[SPEAKER_03]: tongue and gets 7,000 volts through its
nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good negative conditioner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't fool the fence again after that
happens usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing with the repellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start to associate that repellent
smell with the electric fence and so
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes, yeah, I can smell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going near that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, the limitation on electric
fences is that they have acreage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tend to work pretty well for small
fields, small blocks, under about 5 acres
[SPEAKER_03]: in size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes 5 to 10 acres are pretty good,
but usually above 10 acres in size,
[SPEAKER_03]: deer will figure out, oh yeah,
I can jump over that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's something good to eat
inside, they'll learn that behavior and
[SPEAKER_03]: the electric fences will fail eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll talk a bit about bird
management and some general bird
[SPEAKER_03]: management principles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was part of a collaborative project with
Katherine Lindell from Michigan State
[SPEAKER_03]: University and my grad student Heidi
Hendricks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a USDA NIFA, especially crop
research initiative, project funded to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at multi-state impacts of birds on
fruit crops in several states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our partners, again, we're Cornell and
Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sort of led the program and did a lot
of the field work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have partner universities in the
Pacific Northwest in their fruit growing
[SPEAKER_03]: region out there with Oregon State,
Washington State, Trinity, Western,
[SPEAKER_03]: and folks from the USDA National Wildlife
Research Center in Colorado, Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_03]: were involved in some of the survey design
and discussions on techniques to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of different types of bird deterrents
out there, everything from the old
[SPEAKER_03]: scarecrow to the aluminum pie plate you
might see in somebody's backyard to raptor
[SPEAKER_03]: models, scare eye balloons, mylar tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these things may or may not do any
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on your cropping system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, growers depend a lot on these
type of devices to try to reduce bird
[SPEAKER_03]: damage to crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, just sort of a general rule of
thumb, my experience with the hawk and owl
[SPEAKER_03]: model is that they tend not to work at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just a given that the birds
really figure out pretty quickly that
[SPEAKER_03]: these things are plastic and they're no
real danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small areas, we've seen some success with
bird distress collar devices on small
[SPEAKER_03]: areas on certain crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see some of the data I'll show you
in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not particularly encouraging,
but occasionally they work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mylar flagging in the upper right,
that's just a highly reflective flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tended to work pretty well on some
field crop situations, particularly with
[SPEAKER_03]: migrating geese, not so much with resident
geese.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've sort of figured that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Netting, some people consider a permanent
fix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my question the way netting is
done, how well that really works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shooting can be used in limited areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very site specific, whether you can
or can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing goes for trapping,
say starlings around a dairy farm where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're causing contamination of food and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometime a limited trapping effort can do
some good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our project objectives are looking at
things that influence an effective bird
[SPEAKER_03]: damage management strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had one group in Pacific
Northwest and at the National Wildlife
[SPEAKER_03]: Research Center that was looking at
economics to try to quantify cost of bird
[SPEAKER_03]: damage to producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers and how it affects regional
economies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still sort of in the data analysis
and writing stages on that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had another group of social scientists
that was looking at consumer habits and
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, those data are still being
analyzed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope to get a paper out here on that
fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had a group of us looking at
the biological side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Landscape and edge effects, bird species
and behavior, and effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_03]: different management strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last two are the things that we're
farthest along on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna share some data with you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked growers as part of the survey in
all those states in New York, Michigan and
[SPEAKER_03]: the Pacific Northwest, what works and what
doesn't in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see very clearly most growers
feel that the only thing that really works
[SPEAKER_03]: is netting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They claim netting is very moderately
effective about 80% of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else along this access has
effectiveness rates of 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most growers have tried these things over
several years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They realize, well, sometimes they work,
sometimes they don't, but they continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we wanted to get some really
hard data on how well these different
[SPEAKER_03]: devices work for scaring birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had field research sites in New York,
96 unique farms where we collected data in
[SPEAKER_03]: Central and Western New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did bird damage assessments looking at
percent damage of missing fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at edges versus interior,
some growers claimed all the damages on
[SPEAKER_03]: the edges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: We took a look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did intensive bird surveys to look at
what species were present, what's their
[SPEAKER_03]: foraging behavior.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had 52 additional farms in
Michigan that did the exact same protocol.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could combine data from New York and
Michigan on the same crop, same year,
[SPEAKER_03]: same time, and do comparison how well
things worked in two different states.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of damage assessment,
we broke each block or field up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: five stratum.
[SPEAKER_03]: North, south, east, west edges and then
interior stratum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We selected for trees or bushes in terms
of blueberries, 12 randomly selected trees
[SPEAKER_03]: or bushes per stratum, one randomly
selected branch per tree, and then counted
[SPEAKER_03]: all intact missing or damaged fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at sweet cherries,
honey crisp apples,
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberries, and Pinot Noir wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did four focal crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: On grapes, because they're on trellises,
our setup was a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a random height and a random
position along the vine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd pick a random height and position,
and then we'd pick the cluster closest to
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever that random height position fell
out, and we'd count all the fruit on that
[SPEAKER_03]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, damage missing intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additional data we took for each farm,
and so again, location, where there are
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of telephone wires nearby,
a lot of growers say, well, it's those
[SPEAKER_03]: darn wires, the birds get up there perch,
and then they go down and they steal my
[SPEAKER_03]: crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to look, do telephone wires
really have an impact?
[SPEAKER_03]: Other bird management techniques
surrounding land cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks say it's that dairy farm next
door attracts all the starlings,
[SPEAKER_03]: and now they're over here eating my
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got good data on land cover
characteristics around that still being
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at number of plants, each strata,
height, and any special additional data or
[SPEAKER_03]: notes we wanted to take while we're in the
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of observations, we use
standardized point counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two observers, 15 minutes in the block,
counting all the different bird species
[SPEAKER_03]: that they saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it both on the interior of the
block and the exterior of the block.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did foraging observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did, started with stationary,
where positioned the observer where they
[SPEAKER_03]: could see on the edge and in the block,
and just watch for an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: What birds do you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick a focal bird, follow as long as you
can, record all the fruit it touches,
[SPEAKER_03]: eat, consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did moving observations,
where sometimes it's difficult to see
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on in a block, particularly
with tall cherry trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had observers just walk slowly,
find a focal bird, follow it as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: they could.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that bird's gone, find the next bird,
follow it as long as you could to get
[SPEAKER_03]: focal observations on what they're
actually eating and damaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at the sweet cherry data.
[SPEAKER_03]: What really jumps out at you is the
percent fruit loss in both sweet cherries
[SPEAKER_03]: and blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberries was highest in 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys remember what happened in 2012?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else could affect it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, late spring frost.
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% of the cherry crop, sweet cherry crop
in New York was lost in spring 2012,
[SPEAKER_03]: late spring frost, and a big chunk of the
blueberry crop was lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the general principles is if
you've got less fruit on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's a bad year for whatever
reason, drought, late freeze, then those
[SPEAKER_03]: are the years you've got to pay attention
to bird damage, because when you've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: low crop load, the percent fruit loss goes
way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw that in 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: In more normal cropping years,
we didn't see a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little damage in apples, even though
apple growers were saying the birds are
[SPEAKER_03]: eating our fruit, the birds are eating our
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we go out there and measure it,
we don't see a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we only did three orchards in
2014 and saw zero damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't see an ample damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't see an ample damage by a bird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wine grapes tend to be the most
consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing about 3% to 4% loss per year
in Pinot Noir wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberries, again, and sweet cherries,
you get good and bad years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, depends on the crop load.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at, again, the position to see
what growers are saying was true,
[SPEAKER_03]: that edges get more damage in interior.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we definitely don't see that trend in
any of the crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like inside and outside get
damaged pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only pattern that we saw was
interesting was we saw more damage on the
[SPEAKER_03]: north and south end of blocks in wine
grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in wine grapes that would
increase bird damage on the north and
[SPEAKER_03]: south ends?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the orientation of the trellises.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the vineyards are oriented
north-south, parallel to the fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The finger legs, because they're on side
slope, that means the open end of the rows
[SPEAKER_03]: are on the north-south side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you get your most intense
bird damage because it's easier for them
[SPEAKER_03]: to get in the row from the north and south
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But besides that, we saw no pattern based
on position in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at distressed collars and hot
kites as an effigy, raptor effigy.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are very commonly used by growers
throughout New York and Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think they do some good, so we wanted
to see, do they really do any good?
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we measure?
[SPEAKER_03]: We grouped farms into clusters of four.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that cluster of four, you'd have a
block, say a sweet cherry block with a
[SPEAKER_03]: distressed collar, a sweet cherry block
with a hot kite, a sweet cherry block with
[SPEAKER_03]: both devices in the field, and then a
control block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our criteria is all those farms had to be
within 30 miles so they were in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: population of birds because the birds are
very mobile.
[SPEAKER_03]: We selected farms based on the previous
year's damage, so we tried to pick farms
[SPEAKER_03]: that had about the same percent loss and
similar block sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We set up the devices two to three weeks
before harvest, and we positioned them at
[SPEAKER_03]: least four rows into the block.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we had both deterrents on a block,
we set them up on opposite sides from each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then we actually collected data to
see how well these things worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also moved them once a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people say moving a device adds up as
an element of surprise and increases
[SPEAKER_03]: effectiveness, so we switched positions of
devices once weekly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found was these things didn't
make a bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, the damage was highest where
we used both devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, growers think these things work,
but they are wasting a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the control block,
except for this one unusual New York farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually the controls suffered slightly
less damage than the treated blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no significant difference
when we did the stats test across there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just made no difference whatsoever
putting these things up in sweet cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also came across the idea of using air
dancers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might have seen these at the used
car lots, these sort of silky things that
[SPEAKER_03]: are air powered and wave around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought that, oh, these things got
motion, they're big, maybe they'll scare
[SPEAKER_03]: birds better than some of these other
devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we set up site pairs, again,
with the same criteria, and we had one
[SPEAKER_03]: farm with a dancer, one farm without a
dancer, within 30 miles based on the
[SPEAKER_03]: previous year's damage and block size,
again, two to three weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we moved the dancers every two to
three days around the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see sort of the pattern every
couple days, it'd be in a new spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to either, these are electric
powered fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to run them by either an electric
cord, which we didn't have any cases,
[SPEAKER_03]: or a gas fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a gas generator, which means that the
grower had to go out there every day and
[SPEAKER_03]: refill the gas generator, because the
generators had run about eight or nine
[SPEAKER_03]: hours, and then they'd run out of gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But growers are willing to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at sweet cherry damage,
and what we saw with the dancers and sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: cherries, a slight benefit, not
significantly different, slightly less
[SPEAKER_03]: damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still see lots of farm to farm
variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's very typical with bird
damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you got to do a lot of farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do one or two farms, you're not
going to learn anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be doing five, 10 farms to get
some sense of what works and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberries, again, slight difference with
the dancers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had about 6% fruit loss on the dancer
plots, a little over 8% control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at berries lost per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was marginally significant at .05.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, slightly fewer loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at those type of differences,
it doesn't justify loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't justify the cost of running the
things or putting it out in the field of
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we did see a difference was wine
grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we saw was about half the level
of damage where we had dancers and wine
[SPEAKER_03]: grapes, and it was significant at the .01
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these things appeared to work
relatively well on wine grapes during the
[SPEAKER_03]: first two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a lot of farm to farm variability,
and it doesn't work everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can see on this farm in Michigan,
the dancer plot actually had higher damage
[SPEAKER_03]: than they control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you just see tons of
variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: In New York, we had more consistent
results with the air dancers, and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of that has to do with field size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our blocks where we were running this,
our grape vineyards, are tended to be
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller on average than when they were in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our blueberry fields also in New York tend
to be much smaller on average than the
[SPEAKER_03]: typical Michigan blueberry field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where you have smaller blocks,
smaller sites, these devices are more
[SPEAKER_03]: likely to benefit you in work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a comparison between dancers and
control in 2014 and used two dances per
[SPEAKER_03]: site.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how highly significantly
different, except for farm A, everything
[SPEAKER_03]: was highly significantly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these devices really did work on the
wine grapes, and the growers talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one grower, had a naming contest
for his device out by his vineyard,
[SPEAKER_03]: and his customers named him Mr. Pino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what he called his device.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought it was a big deal, a little bit
of marketing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at other variables related to
bird damage, and again, the telephone
[SPEAKER_03]: wires kept coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't see anything significant in
cherries or grapes, and when we looked at
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberries, actually the blueberry fields
that were closest to the telephone wires
[SPEAKER_03]: had less damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason we think is that those tend
to be much larger fields, so the damage
[SPEAKER_03]: was more dispersed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was no strong relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, when we looked at netting,
in pair plots where we had dancers and no
[SPEAKER_03]: dancers, and both areas were netting,
there was no significant difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we're seeing is birds are
getting through this netting with this
[SPEAKER_03]: larger mess size.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen that on Long Island for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The birds are using the netting for a
perch, and then they poke their heads
[SPEAKER_03]: through and damage the grapes through the
netting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So growers are using a lot of netting,
spending a lot of money on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we didn't see it significantly really
reduce the bird damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who are the culprits?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the common bird species we see
in fruit orchards in New York and
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the take-home messages I want
to leave with you is just because you see
[SPEAKER_03]: a bird there doesn't mean that's the bird
that's causing the damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got data to back that up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at sweet cherries in 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most frequent sighting by far in terms
of number of birds were American robins
[SPEAKER_03]: and European starlings were number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at birds taking and eating
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: American robins were number one,
and number of fruits consumed,
[SPEAKER_03]: American robins were number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That lines up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we look at time spent eating fruit,
European starlings, even though they're
[SPEAKER_03]: the second most frequent bird,
they don't eat a lot of fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with cedar waxlings were number two in
terms of eating fruit and feeding on,
[SPEAKER_03]: spent time foraging on fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we didn't see very few cedar
waxlings in the vineyards, but they do a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, growers may be missing the
culprit in these cases because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller, less visible birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw similar patterns in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the most frequent bird we saw in
blueberries were American robins followed
[SPEAKER_03]: by Baltimore Orioles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we looked at time spent eating
fruit, American robins ate very few
[SPEAKER_03]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either time or fruits consumed,
they were almost dead last, even though
[SPEAKER_03]: they were the most common bird seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Baltimore Orioles and the cedar
waxlings again that spent most of the time
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see this with growers a lot,
particularly with turkeys too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, well, the turkeys are damaging
my vineyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we really didn't see turkeys taking
grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because they wander through and
they're big and visible, the grower thinks
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what's causing the problem and it
may not be.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we found is that in our field trials
in New York and Michigan, that the hawk
[SPEAKER_03]: kites and disgraced collars and even the
combination two really didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And past studies had pretty missed results
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did find though that the dancers showed
some optimistic results in grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, we had a couple of our
cooperating grape growers that wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy the air dancers from us after the end
of the trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: They liked them so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do take intensive management.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to either have electric power or
you got to be out there, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: moving around, filling that gas generator
every day to keep the wind sock up and
[SPEAKER_03]: running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nets didn't significantly reduce bird
damage that we saw in the dancer site
[SPEAKER_03]: pairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually saw slightly lower bird
damage with blueberries related to the
[SPEAKER_03]: telephone wires.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, all those sites of wires tend
to be larger blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they just had less damage in
general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing really related to the wires.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just go back to integrated wildlife
management.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're working on farms or working
with a farm owner that's really important
[SPEAKER_03]: to assess everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the species causing damage?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which crops are affected?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many acres?
[SPEAKER_03]: What time?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the housing density?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your neighbors like?
[SPEAKER_03]: While these sound devices, neighbors don't
like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, if your farm's more rural,
you might have more options available to
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got to go through,
you know, what can I afford?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would argue that in most years for
at least fruit crops in New York doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: pay to do any of this stuff except for
maybe air dancers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you get that bad crop year where
you've had a late freeze or you've had a
[SPEAKER_03]: drought and the yield is low, you really
need to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the year you want to do your bird
management because it's going to have an
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on the percentage of fruit that you
might save.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to reassess too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If things don't work, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I do differently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something else I haven't tried?
[SPEAKER_03]: What other options are available to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these things, the growers put
them in the field and they walk away from
[SPEAKER_03]: them and they just assume they're working.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't assess, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very few growers go to the trouble of
actually looking at fruit damage and
[SPEAKER_03]: actual loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to share a website with you,
wildlifecontrol.info.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are results of all sorts of
extension publications for different
[SPEAKER_03]: species if you're interested in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we'll eventually get more data
from our research projects and links to
[SPEAKER_03]: papers and stuff up as we get more of it
written up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate everybody's attention and
be glad to answer questions folks may
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, a lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your early maps showing kind of where most
of the economic damage is, you point out
[SPEAKER_02]: that matches up with where the farms are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from a farmer's perspective,
I'm just curious if you looked at the data
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of damage per farm or per field,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we haven't really looked at it all
at all on a damage per field basis or the
[SPEAKER_03]: way growers react to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you know, if you're getting a
relatively small fields that are high
[SPEAKER_03]: value and a lot of your income's coming
and if you've got wildlife damage,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could be more economically painful,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really haven't looked at,
you know, that many detail at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at the sort of the broad trends,
broad statistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did try to collect bird species
information for the grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we did our foraging observations,
both the stationary and mobile,
[SPEAKER_03]: we found so few birds foraging there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw birds but we actually saw more
flyovers anything else birds that really
[SPEAKER_03]: never fed and so we had zero in terms of
foraging observation and grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the damage was relatively low
compared to the other clout and that may
[SPEAKER_03]: be another reason why the air dancers
tended to work better there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what we call the resident or the
local breeding goose flock, it plateaued
[SPEAKER_03]: now but it plateaued at a really high
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are tens of thousands of birds what
we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're above what we want in New York State
currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back a couple of decades,
there were more what we call the migratory
[SPEAKER_03]: geese, the ones we all grew up with,
that breed in Canada, winter in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Chesapeake, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: But about a decade and a half ago that
flip-flopped and so now there are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: more resident birds in the eastern flyway,
local breeding birds than migrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they cause all sorts of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are short distance migrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do migrate but only when they have
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're the ones that breed locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here pretty much year-round.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need open water which they have on
Cuga Lake year-round and they need grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only thing that's going to drive
them out of here is if we get enough deep
[SPEAKER_03]: persistent snow that they can't forward,
then they force to go south until that
[SPEAKER_03]: snow melts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're here most of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a pilot goose project in Stewart
Park right now where we've been using the
[SPEAKER_03]: Town of Ithaca Goose Committee wanted to
use only non-lethal devices and I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: told them right off, well don't expect the
whole lot from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to at least move birds out of
Stewart Park using firecrackers and
[SPEAKER_03]: radio-controlled cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got them out of the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't go far.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went to the Inlet and Cast Park which
we expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't terrify the park users.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to do it at times of day,
very early in the morning, very late in
[SPEAKER_03]: the evening, not during the middle of the
day when there are a lot of park users.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're putting together a report for
the City of Ithaca here soon on the goose
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really need to start earlier in the
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we learned, we banded 425 geese and
collared 200 adults in Stewart Park this
[SPEAKER_03]: summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you see a goose wandering around
Stewart Park with a big yellow collar,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one we put on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we learned was that most of the
geese that caused the problem in Stewart
[SPEAKER_03]: Park in June and July are not local
breeding birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only found about 10 to 12 pairs that
actually had Gosling.
[SPEAKER_03]: A total of about 60 Gosling that were
produced in and around the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of them are what we call local
molt migrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much water and grass around
Stewart Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect molting area.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they molt, they drop their flight
feathers for five weeks and they cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So birds come in and they look for places
like Stewart Park where they can fly in,
[SPEAKER_03]: drop those flight feathers, just sort of
hang out, feed, defecate everywhere and
[SPEAKER_03]: create all sorts of havoc for five or six
weeks until they regrow their flight
[SPEAKER_03]: feathers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And late July, they're on off again
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got to live with the mess during
that midsummer when the park's got the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest use.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the town and the city need to do is
move those birds out before the molt.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's one of the recommendations
going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before they drop their flight feathers,
that's when you need to do the intensive
[SPEAKER_03]: hazing and nonlethal stuff to try to get
those birds out of there, get them to molt
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then instead of having 450 geese in
Stewart Park in late June, hopefully we
[SPEAKER_03]: can get it down to maybe 40 or 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask a quick question about
wild boar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for a time we did have them in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they're no longer here,
but can you say something about them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can do a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're fortunate that DEC ag and
markets and USDA Wildlife Services saw the
[SPEAKER_03]: wild boar issue starting to emerge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did have some localized breeding
populations in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was up on Cortland on the Dogger
County line, one in Tioga County,
[SPEAKER_03]: one up in Clinton County in northeast New
York, and one on the Sullivan,
[SPEAKER_03]: Delaware county.
[SPEAKER_03]: And USDA Wildlife Services staff got a
contract to come in and do eradication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And USDA and DEC staff really did a good
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially we eradicated breeding wild
boars from New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: They still get escapes every now and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's new legislation that's passed
that farmers can't keep wild boar on their
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was last summer, if I remember
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so hopefully that will eliminate
chances of seeing wild boars in New York
[SPEAKER_03]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania right across our border still
has wild boars and shooting preserves and
[SPEAKER_03]: they escape.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the source of the Tioga County
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still going to have to deal with
that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any last question?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned a lot about what farmers can
do to protect against deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any state programs, for example,
to sterilize deer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think populations can actually
do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that seems controversial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've actually done research on
campus with deer fertility control and
[SPEAKER_03]: sterilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found after about six, seven years
of effort, the best we could do was
[SPEAKER_03]: sterilization, even combining it with our
campus deer hunting program was to
[SPEAKER_03]: stabilize the herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't reduce it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's when we went to our deer
damage permit and started actually
[SPEAKER_03]: removing animals at night over bait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were able to cut the herd in about
half and two years on a damage permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other place I've seen that,
we did a just finishing up an experiment
[SPEAKER_03]: in the village of Cuba Heights.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the fourth year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first two years, they couldn't get
approval for shooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they hired in White Buffalo,
a contractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we worked with White Buffalo and using
Cornell veterinarians, we sterilized 99%
[SPEAKER_03]: of the female deer in the village of Cuba
Heights the first two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found was that having that
high proportion sterilized for two years,
[SPEAKER_03]: the population dropped by 30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't enough immigration to replace
that lack of fawn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the village got approval for a
deer damage permit, a kill permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They contracted the White Buffalo to come
back in the last two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Buffalo's actually done deer removal
with crossbows at night that was approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: By village police.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with the two years of removal,
now they've dropped it another 40%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have 70% reduction in deer in the
village of Cuba Heights right now with
[SPEAKER_03]: that integrated program.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, will they sustain it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing deer management is like mowing the
lawn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't wait a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just give them a two, three year
break, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll reproduce you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be right back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you lose all the gains that you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
