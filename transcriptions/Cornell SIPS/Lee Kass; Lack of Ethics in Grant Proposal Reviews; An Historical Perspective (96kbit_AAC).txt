[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a wonderful introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate everybody who's here,
either virtually or in person,
[SPEAKER_07]: to listen to this presentation,
which is not about Barbara McClintock for
[SPEAKER_07]: a change.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a presentation that stems from
work that I started many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to give you a perspective on
that work.
[SPEAKER_07]: The background for my story began in 1985
while I was searching for publications to
[SPEAKER_07]: document my first edition of The Plants of
San Salvador Island in the Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: The picture of our cover of our first
edition is on the right side of the
[SPEAKER_07]: screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was invited to the Bahamas in the early
1980s to actually teach a class on the
[SPEAKER_07]: botany, marine botany.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a little bit of background on
psychology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I started to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: While we were down there, my students kept
asking me, what's this plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that plant on the terrestrial land?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I started to try to find
publications to try to help them and
[SPEAKER_07]: myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from that, the director of the field
station asked us to write a common plants
[SPEAKER_07]: guide with illustrations, because there
wasn't anything available at the time for
[SPEAKER_07]: the non-botanists.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the class was a general education
course for non-botanists.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from that, we began looking for
published papers to include in our common
[SPEAKER_07]: plants guide, which was actually
illustrated by one of my students,
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Kowalski.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1995, while I was waiting to board the
plane to attend the first symposium on the
[SPEAKER_07]: botany of the Bahamas on San Salvador
Island, which is currently called the
[SPEAKER_07]: Natural History of the Bahamas,
I met Dr. Hardy Eshba.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's a picture of Hardy on the right
that I took many years later.
[SPEAKER_07]: So who was this guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is he so important to my story?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hardy was a Quineleon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And an Indiana University PhD,
who later became interested in the Bahama
[SPEAKER_07]: flora.
[SPEAKER_07]: At this 1985 Bahamas conference that we
were going to, he presented an unpublished
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution map for plants that were
compiled by William Thomas Gillis that he
[SPEAKER_07]: had actually found in the herbarium at
Michigan State University.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, on the right hand side of the screen,
you can see this distribution map.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of many hundreds that are currently in
the Michigan State University herbarium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what Gillis did is he began looking
and became interested in the Bahama flora
[SPEAKER_07]: in the early 70s, actually the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he began documenting the distribution
of all the plants at the Bahamas on these
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution maps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And each one of the little dots there
represents a plant that he had either
[SPEAKER_07]: collected or he had found in the
literature or he came across in a
[SPEAKER_07]: herbarium.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this really helped us figure out,
well, what were the plants that were on
[SPEAKER_07]: San Salvador by looking at Gillis' maps.
[SPEAKER_07]: So during this time, we, as I said,
we were looking to find publications and
[SPEAKER_07]: we came across this big book that had just
recently been published by Carell and
[SPEAKER_07]: Carell called The Flora of the Bahama
Archipelago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this book was basically for
taxonomists.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not a book for the general public.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had descriptions in Latin and we got a
copy of it and schlepped it in our
[SPEAKER_07]: backpacks down to San Salvador on a
regular basis while trying to describe the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants of the Bahamas for our book.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we noticed was in the preface to
this book was an acknowledgement to the
[SPEAKER_07]: National Science Foundation for funding
the publication of the book.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing we noticed was that
there were no or very few references to
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Gillis' publications.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I said to Hardy, why was Gillis' work
ignored in the Carell's recently published
[SPEAKER_07]: Flora of the Bahama Archipelago?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Hardy, oh, where am I?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, going the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Hardy suggested that I contact
associates who might know the answers to
[SPEAKER_07]: my question.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the people that actually worked
with Gillis on his interest in the Bahama
[SPEAKER_07]: flora was Richard Howard of the Harvard
University Herberia and he provided many
[SPEAKER_07]: leads to finding the answers to my
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I drove up to Boston, Cambridge
actually, and I interviewed Dick Howard in
[SPEAKER_07]: 1993 at the Harvard University Herberia to
try to get some answers and documentation
[SPEAKER_07]: on what was going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the search to solve my question
precipitated finding documents revealing a
[SPEAKER_07]: lack of ethics and grant proposal reviews
and a story to our horror, Dishonor,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the subject of this seminar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Hardy and I have written a manuscript
that was submitted and accepted for
[SPEAKER_07]: publication that gives the absolute
background of the whole story.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just going to give you a brief
review of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The publication should be out and we were
promised that it would be out in the
[SPEAKER_07]: spring of 2024 in Huntia, the Journal of
Botanical History.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about or let's see what we
found.
[SPEAKER_07]: The National Science Foundation had
conflicts of interest problems with grants
[SPEAKER_07]: to short-term employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: These short-term employees are known as
rotators.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in 1979, the United States General
Accounting Office, which is currently
[SPEAKER_07]: called the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: General Accounting Office, began a review
of the National Science Foundation's
[SPEAKER_07]: policies and procedures for precluding
conflicts of interests in its grant award
[SPEAKER_07]: process, specifically when NSF former
short-term rotator employees were
[SPEAKER_07]: involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: The review was precipitated by a request
from Congressman Carl D.
[SPEAKER_07]: Purcell, a Republican from Michigan,
who had submitted this request in May of
[SPEAKER_07]: 1979.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congressman Purcell had made a request to
the government office on behalf of a
[SPEAKER_07]: constituent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I want you to know that this proposal
or this review that they made did not
[SPEAKER_07]: reveal any names.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he made a request on behalf of his
constituent who unfortunately did not live
[SPEAKER_07]: to see the outcome of their review.
[SPEAKER_07]: A draft of the GAO 1981 report included a
proposal for identifying conflicts of
[SPEAKER_07]: interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the National Science Foundation
implemented that proposal, which
[SPEAKER_07]: concluded, quote, should provide greater
visibility to potential conflict of
[SPEAKER_07]: interest situations associated with grants
involving rotators and to resolve
[SPEAKER_07]: conflicts in accordance with statutes and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Additional specifics of this case that
regarded Purcell's unnamed constituent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Purcell had asked for a review of National
Science Foundation policies and procedures
[SPEAKER_07]: for awarding grants to former National
Science Foundation employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: He specifically requested clarification
whether these policies and procedures,
[SPEAKER_07]: including provisions for their waiver,
adequately prevented conflicts of interest
[SPEAKER_07]: and whether NSF complies with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually published in that report.
[SPEAKER_07]: The investigation, as summarized here,
Purcell interest in the case was brought
[SPEAKER_07]: to his attention by a researcher,
unnamed in the report, from his home
[SPEAKER_07]: district, whose proposal NSF had declined
to fund, although it later funded a
[SPEAKER_07]: similar project proposed by a former
National Science Foundation employee.
[SPEAKER_07]: The government office investigation
focused on the special problems of
[SPEAKER_07]: processing grants from short term
employees, the rotators who worked for
[SPEAKER_07]: National Science Foundation for one or two
years, and to assess NSF grant award
[SPEAKER_07]: process as it relates to awards made to
scientists who are being considered for or
[SPEAKER_07]: are serving in or have completed short
term appointments in the National Science
[SPEAKER_07]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: They found 39 problems in grant activity
for 24 past and current short term NSF
[SPEAKER_07]: appointments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Recall this investigation began in 79,
the report was done in 81.
[SPEAKER_07]: 23 individuals in the sample, including
the National Science Foundation appointee
[SPEAKER_07]: in the case involving Congressman
Purcell's constituent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Contributing to the problem were decisions
on this grant activity made by associates
[SPEAKER_07]: to the NSF appointees, and often the
relationships were between supervisors and
[SPEAKER_07]: subordinates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Additional specifics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Questionable circumstances surrounded a
waiver of post employment restrictions and
[SPEAKER_07]: proposed review.
[SPEAKER_07]: Purcell's constituent had submitted a
proposal that the National Science
[SPEAKER_07]: Foundation declined, but the decision on
which to judge whether the constituent's
[SPEAKER_07]: proposal was treated fairly was limited
because all files relating to it had been
[SPEAKER_07]: destroyed by the time of the government's
review.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a quote.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'd like you to please keep this
statement in mind, especially what I state
[SPEAKER_07]: in the highlighted dark brown lettering.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll repeat it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: All files relating to it had been
destroyed by the time of the government
[SPEAKER_07]: review.
[SPEAKER_07]: Around the time the constituent's proposal
was rejected, another researcher began a
[SPEAKER_07]: two year rotational appointment at the
National Science Foundation in the program
[SPEAKER_07]: office that had rejected it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The NSF appointee applied for a waiver to
submit a proposal upon leaving NSF.
[SPEAKER_07]: After leaving NSF, the appointee submitted
a proposal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the same subject.
[SPEAKER_07]: As the constituents.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did they find?
[SPEAKER_07]: They found conflicts of interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: The former NSF employees submitted his
proposal to the program that he had
[SPEAKER_07]: directed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The proposal review was completed in three
months.
[SPEAKER_07]: According to their findings, it actually
was six weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It usually took about five months to act
on the proposals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was reported.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was actually eight months for the
constituents proposal to get his review
[SPEAKER_07]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: The National Science Foundation program
officer who made the award recommended for
[SPEAKER_07]: the former NSF program officer had earlier
used the NSF appointee as a reference on
[SPEAKER_07]: his own application for his own employment
at the National Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he had also worked for the former
employee appointee.
[SPEAKER_07]: These were the findings from the USGAO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, with the help of Richard Howard,
among others, we tracked down the grant
[SPEAKER_07]: proposals.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1993, myself and my husband located all
of Purcell's constituents research files,
[SPEAKER_07]: including copies of both National Science
Foundation grant proposals.
[SPEAKER_07]: The files were archived at the Michigan
State University Herbarium and at the
[SPEAKER_07]: Fairchild Tropical Garden Herbarium and
Library Archives.
[SPEAKER_07]: The documents at MSC, Michigan State
University Herbarium, and at the Fairchild
[SPEAKER_07]: Tropical Garden Herbarium, revealed that
the NSF appointee was Donovan Carell,
[SPEAKER_07]: program director of systems and systematic
biology, and the co-author of the 1982
[SPEAKER_07]: Flora of the Bahama Archipelago,
and who they had funded twice,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was in their preface to their book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Purcell's constituent was W.T.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gillis, the guy who did all those
distribution maps, and was a former
[SPEAKER_07]: Fairchild Tropical Garden employee,
and the author of the original rejected
[SPEAKER_07]: grant proposal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carell's National Science Foundation grant
proposed writing an illustrated Vascular
[SPEAKER_07]: Flora of the Bahama Islands.
[SPEAKER_07]: He submitted it from the Fairchild
Tropical Garden on October 1st,
[SPEAKER_07]: 1973, two months after he had left the
National Science Foundation appointment,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was approved six weeks later on 15
November, 1973.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much of the text was derived from the
grant proposal previously submitted to the
[SPEAKER_07]: National Science Foundation by Gillis from
the same institution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the case as was summarized by the
USGAO in 1981.
[SPEAKER_07]: The National Science Foundation awarded
the former NSF appointee more than $90,000
[SPEAKER_07]: over five years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Within the five years, he requested and
was granted an increase that brought the
[SPEAKER_07]: total award to more than $100,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: During the six years, he was awarded about
$40,000 in additional funds, and the grant
[SPEAKER_07]: period was extended to a total of more
than seven and a half years.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the major arguments made by
reviewers of Gillis's 1970 National
[SPEAKER_07]: Science Foundation grant proposal,
which we found at the Michigan State
[SPEAKER_07]: University Herbarium, was to prepare a
manual and a flora of the Bahama vascular
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, and the argument was that the cost
was too high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet, the USGAO report revealed that Carell
received over 75% in funding for one
[SPEAKER_07]: investigator, himself, and for fewer years
of support than Gillis had originally
[SPEAKER_07]: requested for three researchers,
himself, Dr. Howard, and Dr. Proctor of
[SPEAKER_07]: the Institute of Research in Jamaica,
who was also researching the flora of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the question is, is this really a
plagiarized grant proposal?
[SPEAKER_07]: Revising and submitting a Bahama flora
grant proposal might be justified by
[SPEAKER_07]: assuming the project was the purview of
the institution where it had been
[SPEAKER_07]: initiated.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all well and good, except that the
argument doesn't really fly because it
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't the institution that started this,
but it was actually the researchers within
[SPEAKER_07]: that institution whose idea it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carell's October 1973 grant proposal
misrepresented what actually happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said Gillis's involvement initiating
the project in 1968 at Fairchild Tropical
[SPEAKER_07]: Garden, they did not include the fact that
Gillis's involvement initiating the
[SPEAKER_07]: project in 1968 at Fairchild Tropical
Garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: They misrepresented it as a institutional
proposal, which it was not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was only signed by the institution
director but he had nothing to do with the
[SPEAKER_07]: grant proposal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gillis and collaborators having priority
and partial funding for the Bahama flora
[SPEAKER_07]: project was ignored.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not cite any of the previous or
current publications that Gillis had done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not part of the grant proposal and
they did not acknowledge that there was
[SPEAKER_07]: priority that someone else had started
this project years before.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the priority for writing a Bahama
flora?
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1970, Gillis began collecting and
published his first report towards writing
[SPEAKER_07]: a new Bahama flora.
[SPEAKER_07]: The publication came out in 1970 and we
cited it in 1991.
[SPEAKER_07]: With Richard Howard and Dick Proctor,
Gillis continued the project until he
[SPEAKER_07]: died, his untimely death in 1979.
[SPEAKER_07]: He died on June 20th, 1979.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1979, approximately two months after
the investigation began by the USGAO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Picture on the right on the bottom shows
Howard and Gillis with the students doing
[SPEAKER_07]: research in the Bahamas in the early or
the mid 1970s.
[SPEAKER_07]: The National Science Foundation had
recognized that it has been less than
[SPEAKER_07]: successful in addressing the unique
problems associated with the rotator
[SPEAKER_07]: program.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a quote.
[SPEAKER_07]: The United States government organization
report had sensitized NSF employees to
[SPEAKER_07]: conflicts of interest problems in the
rotator program, they reported.
[SPEAKER_07]: And accordingly, the National Science
Foundation will take steps to address new
[SPEAKER_07]: conflicts of interest policies.
[SPEAKER_07]: With respect to the case at hand,
meaning the issue with the constituent,
[SPEAKER_07]: the National Science Foundation plan to
issue a directive that all staff in grades
[SPEAKER_07]: GS12 and above who are leaving the
National Science Foundation be especially
[SPEAKER_07]: counseled by the ethics counselor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ethics counselor is in the office of
the general counsel at NSF about
[SPEAKER_07]: post-employment conflicts of interest
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Further, they report that a former
employee is precluded during one year
[SPEAKER_07]: period after the National Science
Foundation service from submitting a new
[SPEAKER_07]: proposal to the National Science
Foundation as principal investigator and
[SPEAKER_07]: from receiving compensation under any NSF
award other than one on which he or she
[SPEAKER_07]: suspended work when coming to the
foundation that appears in their appendix.
[SPEAKER_07]: The final conclusion, I say, yet,
the National Science Foundation believed
[SPEAKER_07]: that none of the basic rules that they
used to guard against conflicts of
[SPEAKER_07]: interest involving rotators was violated
in any of the cases cited in the draft
[SPEAKER_07]: report.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's in appendix three.
[SPEAKER_07]: So NSF is still denying that they did
anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: The USGAO believe that their final
recommendations to the director of the
[SPEAKER_07]: National Science Foundation, if they were
implemented, would resolve conflicts of
[SPEAKER_07]: interest questions for the National
Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The enforcement of the National Science
Foundation policies might have reassured
[SPEAKER_07]: Bill Gillis that a case such as his would
not be repeated.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, unfortunately, he didn't see
this decision because he died in 1979.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevertheless, our findings revealed that
basic rules from the NSF had been used to
[SPEAKER_07]: guard against conflicts of interest
involving rotators were violated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we did our research, when we found
the documentation, it was clear to us that
[SPEAKER_07]: these interests were definitely violated,
although NSF denied it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our conclusion, keeping within
historical perspective, we may recall the
[SPEAKER_07]: words of the Roman historian Tacitus.
[SPEAKER_07]: The principal office of history I take to
be this, to prevent virtuous actions from
[SPEAKER_07]: being forgotten and that evil words and
deeds should fear an infamous reputation
[SPEAKER_07]: with posterity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is an interesting conclusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only if one can get the information out
that proves that there was a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hardy and I have been trying to get this
paper published for 20 years and no one
[SPEAKER_07]: would publish it until last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Acknowledgements.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all the places that we visited,
talked to zillions of people to get the
[SPEAKER_07]: documentation for our story.
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to entertain questions if you
have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a question, Judy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Biodiversity of the Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said something about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Concerned with hurricanes slamming the
Caribbean that there are some more that
[SPEAKER_05]: may be at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Question was, are you concerned about
hurricanes hitting the Bahamas and and
[SPEAKER_00]: wiping out species?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we we lost we lost a lot of plants
during Hurricane Dorian and.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that's important for the
herbarium is to document the plants that
[SPEAKER_07]: were there and what and any that might
have been lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now we're in the process of doing
that and Ethan Fried and the Bahamas
[SPEAKER_07]: National Trust is working on that project.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been directly to the Bahamas in
awhile, but but I have colleagues who are
[SPEAKER_07]: working on Saint Salvador and fortunately
the the hurricanes on Saint Salvador
[SPEAKER_07]: haven't been as devastating as ones in
the.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more the more western islands,
but sure, we are definitely concerned
[SPEAKER_07]: about the that and I've written a recent
article on the Bahama endemics.
[SPEAKER_07]: As has Ethan Fried and we've published the
importance of the endemics on and on which
[SPEAKER_07]: islands they are and the one we the
publication that we recently wrote was
[SPEAKER_07]: about the endemics that we found on Saint
Salvador, which are fortunately still
[SPEAKER_07]: safe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just learned recently that the Duke
University herbarium was is being closed
[SPEAKER_07]: and that is such a shame because how are
we going to document loss of diversity if
[SPEAKER_07]: the herbaria are not being kept kept up?
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it is definitely a concern,
but but the other thing that's important
[SPEAKER_07]: is to plant trees like or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not definitely necessarily trees,
but but mangrove trees specifically along
[SPEAKER_07]: the coast so that they can protect the
inland coastline and when the when the.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mangroves get destroyed or are cut down
that causes a big problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've we've.
Advocated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or replanting Bahamian species of
mangroves that have been destroyed taken
[SPEAKER_07]: out and they are doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: In many places right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if that answers your
question or not, but those are my
[SPEAKER_07]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she says that answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any invasive species that are
causing problems in in the Bahamas?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have a list of invasives and
there's really not a lot that we can do
[SPEAKER_07]: about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, it's just like in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been going through places and
pulling them out and you know we do that
[SPEAKER_07]: on Saint Salvador too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortunately, Saint Salvador is like way
out there and and so we don't have as many
[SPEAKER_07]: invasives as some of the other islands.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I go back to this picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see my screen or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to share again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, never mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so anyway, San Salvador is way out
there and and is one of the islands that
[SPEAKER_07]: actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you know that or familiar
with San Salvador Island, but it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: first one that Columbus landed on.
[SPEAKER_07]: When he came to the New World.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's if you go to his log,
you can see all the trees and plants that
[SPEAKER_07]: were on since Salvador when Columbus first
landed and we we now know how many of
[SPEAKER_07]: those have been destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because because what happened in
in the 1700s is that people from the
[SPEAKER_07]: United States came to the Bahamas to
establish plantations and they took out a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of the trees and shrubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they did that, all the topsoil
ended up in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the plants that are left.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are ones that can survive in a xerophytic
environment and also can have an
[SPEAKER_07]: association, mostly lots of legumes
because they have an association with the
[SPEAKER_07]: fungus that can provide nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several questions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thanks for a great talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you can hear me OK, but I'm curious
if you've seen ethical issues in funding
[SPEAKER_06]: from other organizations other than NSF.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe like public funding through the USDA
or private funding through the Gates
[SPEAKER_06]: Foundation or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not looked elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I can tell you is that
NSF now has a requirement that all
[SPEAKER_07]: rotators take a class on conflicts of
interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to take one NSF offers a class
monthly and rotators have to take at least
[SPEAKER_07]: one every I forget what the exact number
is every every couple of months or at
[SPEAKER_07]: least once a year to understand conflicts
of interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you find a conflict of interest or
if you think there is one, you can report
[SPEAKER_07]: it to the counselor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they have they have ways to do that
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all that stems from this paper from
this investigation back in nineteen
[SPEAKER_07]: seventy nine that that Gillis brought to
his congressman and said, look,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, this grant was stolen from me
and and I want you to investigate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious if you think the
current conflict of interest policy is
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient or do we still have ways to go
and what your suggestion would be to
[SPEAKER_03]: improve the policy around conflicts of
interest?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I personally have not I
personally have not been involved with the
[SPEAKER_07]: National Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact, I have to tell you
that that when when Hardy and I first
[SPEAKER_07]: started this project and we wanted to get
we did get one paper published in Rhodora
[SPEAKER_07]: about this guy's Gillis's contributions to
the Bahama flora.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we wanted to say something about what
we found with the conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the editor of Rhodora said,
you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't publish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to cryptically you have to
cryptically write it so that it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: obvious.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we modified the paper and he published
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other thing he said was,
if you publish this paper, you will never
[SPEAKER_07]: ever get an NSF grant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he told us.
[SPEAKER_07]: The editor of Rhodora told us that now
that I mean, that didn't happen because I
[SPEAKER_07]: do have have gotten NSF grants.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we were warned that if we publish
anything about this, we would not be
[SPEAKER_07]: granted funding in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been trying to get this paper
published.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we couldn't get it published until
very recently when the people at the Hunt
[SPEAKER_07]: Institute said, yeah, we'll publish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what I mean, I can't
answer your question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not know if there have been recent
conflicts of interest in grant proposal
[SPEAKER_07]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there have been, then people have
now have recourse to report them where
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't have that before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just jump in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Larry Smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Larry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a co-PI on an NSF project that
was led by Matt Olson at Texas Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in the Dimensions of Biodiversity
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It included Matt as a PI, myself,
Steve DeFazio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another colleague at University of
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the original four year grant,
I thought, was very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we published a ton of papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the U.S.-China program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Chinese collaborators also
published a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we went to renew the project
and continue it, Matt decided to rotate at
[SPEAKER_01]: NSF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Steve decided to rotate at NSF.
[SPEAKER_01]: So neither one of them could be listed as
PIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even beyond that, when it went for
review, it had to go to a different I
[SPEAKER_01]: think even a different division for the
decision because Steve was rotating in
[SPEAKER_01]: that division and they couldn't make a
decision within that division because he
[SPEAKER_01]: was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, it wasn't renewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I partially blame those ties for
rotating at NSF because they could not be
[SPEAKER_01]: listed as co-PIs on the renewal proposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I thought it was a fantastic
project, but you know, that's why these
[SPEAKER_01]: things happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now you have some background on why
that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you know Steve is still at NSF.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know he was in the biology department at
West Virginia University and now he's at
[SPEAKER_07]: NSF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your question?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's related to previous questions
already, but just curious how you couch
[SPEAKER_04]: your case from 1981 in temporary time and
how we should be, especially as early
[SPEAKER_04]: researchers, be looking out for the
conference of interest at the NSF and
[SPEAKER_04]: other grant-gaining fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just like the stealing of ideas,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't quite hear the whole question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about early career researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should you be concerned about
conflicts of interest?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how the case from 1981 can be
situated in temporary time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I teach a graduate genetic seminar here
at West Virginia University.
[SPEAKER_07]: I co-teach it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually presented this story to my
class as a practice seminar a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were very concerned.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that these are graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said they really wanted,
they were very happy to hear the story and
[SPEAKER_07]: were very interested in knowing about how
to preclude conflicts of interest in
[SPEAKER_07]: proposals and reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only that, but in reviewing papers
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that the thing to do is use it
as a lesson in a graduate seminar,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe, to teach graduate students,
as we're doing here, about the
[SPEAKER_07]: possibilities to prevent conflicts of
interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that answer the question or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she says, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you first wanted to present,
I didn't really realize, oh my goodness,
[SPEAKER_02]: a historian can present something
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for me, I don't know for all of
you online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt you're not only a historian,
almost like a detective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost felt it can be used as a script
to make a movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you think this is an interesting
story, you should look forward to reading
[SPEAKER_07]: my book about Barbara McClintock,
where I've uncovered a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: documentation that reverses a lot of
mythology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that should be out in June.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just giving you a little bit of a
warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Related to that, I felt 20 years you have
been so devoted to this publication,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost on a mission.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering, when you originally
asked that question, that was completely
[SPEAKER_02]: without any background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already have some hint, some
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't have any hint at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I knew is that I was looking for
publications to include in my book,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was published in 1991.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in order to document the publications
that had been already done, and for the
[SPEAKER_07]: island of San Salvador, I wanted to make
sure I found everything that I could
[SPEAKER_07]: include in my bibliography for my students
so that they could go to the primary
[SPEAKER_07]: papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because one of the things I loved about
learning at Cornell is that Cornell always
[SPEAKER_07]: required, when I was taking classes,
required us to read primary papers rather
[SPEAKER_07]: than reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every class that I took, we'd get a
handout with primary papers to read.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I took that as a way of teaching.
[SPEAKER_07]: And whenever I write a paper or wrote my
books, I always tried to find the primary
[SPEAKER_07]: papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I was looking for the primary
papers, and they weren't listed in this
[SPEAKER_07]: book.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I said to Hardy, how come they're
not listed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why were they ignored?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is that this guy,
the Corrals, didn't want any part of
[SPEAKER_07]: Gillis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't want him involved in their
project at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a cover-up, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this project just fell into my lap.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Hardy was wonderful in collaborating
with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact, the first paper that
I tried to publish on the contributions of
[SPEAKER_07]: Bill Gillis, when I sent it to the Rodora,
the editor did not want to publish it at
[SPEAKER_07]: all, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I called Hardy on the phone,
and I said, at the time, I think he was
[SPEAKER_07]: the president of the Botanical Society.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he picked up the phone,
and he called the editor, and he goes,
[SPEAKER_07]: what is the matter with you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you want to publish this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was afraid to publish it because of
what we had found.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I said to the editor, well,
what if I put Hardy's name on the paper?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, well, that might help.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I said to Hardy, well, if your name is
going to be on the paper, then you have to
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to write part of this paper,
or it's unethical for me to just stick
[SPEAKER_07]: your name on the paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he went back and looked through his
files, and then he added some stuff to the
[SPEAKER_07]: paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the paper came out in 1993,
I think it was, contributions of Bill
[SPEAKER_07]: Gillis to the floor of the Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's by Cass and Eshba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of us that have worked with Lee know
for sure that Lee is one person or
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee, I just recently read Daniel Stone's
book, The Food Explorer, about David
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairchild.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, David Fairchild, the anti-Semite,
yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that just came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fairchild Botanic Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume that you visited that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really love to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it's a beautiful garden there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an incredible place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a matter of fact, there's a living
Bahama collection there that the director
[SPEAKER_07]: at the time, when Bill Gillis was working
there, had put together this living Bahama
[SPEAKER_07]: collection, which he was collecting
horticultural varieties that were
[SPEAKER_07]: xerophytic, that could survive in a
Florida environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he wanted to plant these
horticultural varieties in Florida,
[SPEAKER_07]: which he did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you go there, you can find them,
you can see them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the only connection that the
director at the time had to the flora of
[SPEAKER_07]: the Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact, Bill Gillis was so
upset with him because every time he would
[SPEAKER_07]: collect a specimen and put it in the
herbarium, he wouldn't make a label for it
[SPEAKER_07]: to say where it was collected,
when it was collected, all this stuff that
[SPEAKER_07]: a taxonomist does when a taxonomist
collects it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He collects plants and makes a label for
the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_07]: He never did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just was interested in what color the
plants were.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when Bill Gillis established the
herbarium for the Fairchild Tropical
[SPEAKER_07]: Garden in 1968, when he was hired there,
he started the herbarium and then decided
[SPEAKER_07]: that he wanted to do a flora of the
Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the director, whose name I'm not
mentioning, of the project said,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever you want to do, it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the researcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, I want to do a flora of the
Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, OK, fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dick Howard said, well, you should put
a recommendation and a proposal into the
[SPEAKER_07]: National Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they submitted it in 1970.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the director's name was not on it
except the cover letter, which said,
[SPEAKER_07]: yes, he's working at my institution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's OK for him to submit this
proposal.
[SPEAKER_07]: But years later, then he says,
no, the proposal belonged to the
[SPEAKER_07]: institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question's for Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting close to running out of
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in the chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, you want to read it to me,
please?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm not doing very well with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything known about professional
relationships?
[SPEAKER_00]: Between Gillis and Correll, strong mutual
dislike preceding the NSF proposal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is so striking to me beyond
plagiarism is the subsequent ignoring of
[SPEAKER_00]: Gillis' work in Correll's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so I can answer that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so Gillis was working at
Fairchild Tropical Garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was fired.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was fired because he didn't get along
with the director.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the director fired him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he went to Harvard to continue
the project of the Mahama Flora at
[SPEAKER_07]: Harvard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the director of the Fairchild Tropical
Garden then contacted Correll,
[SPEAKER_07]: who was at the time program director at
NSF.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while he was program director,
he and his wife went to the Fairchild
[SPEAKER_07]: Tropical Garden and had a meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all documented that they met and
said, we're going to write a Mahama Flora.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then the director took the grant
proposal and rewrote it along with Correll
[SPEAKER_07]: and his wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when Gillis found out that they were
going to redo or submit the grant proposal
[SPEAKER_07]: and had gotten it, he wrote letters to
Correll, zillions of letters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a couple dozen letters to Correll.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he kept saying, I'm here to help you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to help you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time he published a paper,
he would send the paper to Correll.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got a stack of papers that were
signed by Bill Gillis that was sent to
[SPEAKER_07]: Fairchild Tropical Garden to Correll
saying, here are the papers I'm writing
[SPEAKER_07]: about the Mahama Flora.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of them are cited in his book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the background, I can tell
you, between Correll and Gillis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give Lee a hand for a wonderful
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Courage and justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the take home message for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for your help with the technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
