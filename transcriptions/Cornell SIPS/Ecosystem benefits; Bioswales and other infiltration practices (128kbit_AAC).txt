[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the idea today is to hear about
bioswales infiltration practices and what
[SPEAKER_08]: we've done on Cornell campus, show you how
we did it, what's... To be clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: the focus is really about soil and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to give you engineering
practices or to run off chow, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture really has a particular focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we'll spend some time in here
seeing those practices and seeing what
[SPEAKER_08]: we've done and how we did it, and then
we'll go outside, hope the weather holds
[SPEAKER_08]: off, and we'll see the two bioswales we
were specifically talking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one thing to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something else to see the evolution
of built form and after a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: two years, three years, what your
expectations might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do them correctly, if you do them
poorly, you know what those look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't want to see those.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So ecosystem services or ecosystem
benefits, we rely on a landscape to
[SPEAKER_08]: provide many of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've heard about this term ecosystem
services or benefits, and they relate to
[SPEAKER_08]: stormwater reduction, air and water,
water quality improvement, energy
[SPEAKER_08]: conservation, carbon sequestration,
keeping carbon in the plants, urban island
[SPEAKER_08]: mitigation, and habitat for pollinators
and animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're going to specifically look at
the stormwater reduction aspect of
[SPEAKER_08]: ecosystem services, but they do have other
aspects in terms of some of these other
[SPEAKER_08]: services that we get.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is stormwater?
[SPEAKER_08]: Rain or snow melt that does not directly
infiltrate the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Impervious service in the US is estimated
to be 43,000 square miles, and about 400
[SPEAKER_08]: square miles is added each year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that paved surfaces is what prevents
water from infiltrating in the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Compacted soils also, which is very
ubiquitous, in urban areas, reduce water
[SPEAKER_08]: infiltration.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all this increases the stormwater tax,
taxes the capacity of combined stormwater
[SPEAKER_08]: sewage treatment plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And many cities are looking at this issue,
and people are even asked to produce
[SPEAKER_08]: these.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we thought, what better way to have
this on the Cornell campus, teach our
[SPEAKER_08]: students, and teach folks who come to hear
about it, like you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 81% of the US population is urban,
and in New York state, 88% of the
[SPEAKER_08]: population lives in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to say that in urban areas,
you have lots of impervious surfaces,
[SPEAKER_08]: roads, buildings, cars, sidewalks,
parking lots, and that's where most of
[SPEAKER_08]: these impacts will be felt, and how we can
mitigate them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we see what's happening down in
North Carolina, South Carolina,
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of all the flooding, that's not
going to be gone away with by using
[SPEAKER_08]: infiltration devices, but there's a lot
more of this happening in urban areas
[SPEAKER_08]: where infiltration is very poor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So stormwater issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are why we don't want stormwater not
to go into the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sedimentation and trash, stream bank
erosion, a lot of excess nutrient,
[SPEAKER_08]: organic, and hydrocarbon pollution from
parking lots, other places that are
[SPEAKER_08]: excluding these things, bacterial
contamination, pesticide pollution,
[SPEAKER_08]: poisoning, road salt contamination.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of these things are on the impervious
surfaces and get washed into our streams,
[SPEAKER_08]: our rivers, and cause pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit on line today about
the contamination caused by stormwater and
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding relative to the hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while that's an extreme case,
it happens in different conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes related to agriculture,
where we're dealing with manures and other
[SPEAKER_00]: material that flows off as a part of
stormwater events.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it behooves us to get the water back in
the ground and not let it flow into our
[SPEAKER_08]: waterways.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, this is not too far from
here a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Route 81.
[SPEAKER_08]: Route 81 going down to Binghamton.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we had huge flooding involved in
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right in the southern tier was a
tremendous amount of flooding and a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: doing to dealing with impervious surfaces.
[SPEAKER_08]: So infiltration practices, bioswales.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are lots of different infiltration
practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bioswales are a stormwater runoff
conveyance, an infiltration system that
[SPEAKER_08]: slows, directs, cleans, and helps
infiltrate water runoff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the plants assist in stormwater
infiltration and provide ecological value,
[SPEAKER_08]: such as creating habitat and reducing
urban heat islands.
[SPEAKER_08]: So plants are part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think oftentimes we don't think about
all these benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so focused on stormwater that we're
not looking at things like habitat
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on Cornell University, this is a
mock-up of a sustainability trail,
[SPEAKER_08]: which we built and are about to launch on
the Cornell campus, where we basically
[SPEAKER_08]: call out different programs and practices,
which we've done all in orange here,
[SPEAKER_08]: that deal with ecosystem benefits
services.
[SPEAKER_08]: And today we're going to be looking at
this quarter mile long bioswale and these
[SPEAKER_08]: three linked bioswales there, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all of these are bioswales,
but there's some ecological practice that
[SPEAKER_08]: we'd like to help people learn about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're looking at the Tower Road
bioswale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go to one of these studies,
a QR code, you can link to a website,
[SPEAKER_08]: find out more about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we think this would be a useful thing
for people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of just walking by a landscape,
they'll see, well, this is actually
[SPEAKER_08]: working landscapes, a functional
landscape, as well as being beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it tells the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a black locust post just there
for her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sustainable, non-rotting.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is our site, the Tower Road
bioswale site.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior to building the bioswale,
it was a place where there was a nose-in
[SPEAKER_08]: parking for, I don't know, 50 years or
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was over 200 cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had turf cream.
[SPEAKER_08]: So very compacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see there's no storm water just
sits there or goes into storm drains.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no infiltration at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the site before we started to
work on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the idea is that we, this is a,
pretty complex little area here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our sidewalk, a curb.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an open curb pitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting storm water off of the road
into this designed soil and aggregate
[SPEAKER_08]: sub-base.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important to think when you're
dealing with perviousness, it's not just
[SPEAKER_08]: getting water to soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: The soil has to be infiltrated fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to have a reservoir to hold
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the soil is designed to be a sandy
loam.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a loam with high organic matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of a, it holds water,
but it also drains water quite fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's only about 18 inches in our
particular site.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then geotextile and then open
aggregate, number two stone, typically
[SPEAKER_08]: would be anywhere from 12 to 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was done sort of on a shoestring
at Cornell, but it still works pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be much deeper than that and hold
more water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but on top of Cornell being what it
is, on top of the aggregate, they thought
[SPEAKER_08]: they'd have a perf pipe in case there was
too much water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in case we had hurricane Florence come
right here so that there would be extra,
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit of slope and any excess water
we pulled into a storm drain.
[SPEAKER_08]: We argued against this, but that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of this, there was a geotextile
and then the soil was added on top of
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So aggregate sub base, you know,
provides a lot of surge capacity.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's important to have that reservoir
under your soil, open graded, clean,
[SPEAKER_08]: durable one to two inch gives you porosity
about 35 to 40% of pore space that holds
[SPEAKER_08]: water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the depth of the aggregate can be
varied to provide more storage volume.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about, it used to be that the 20,
the a hundred year storm was six inches in
[SPEAKER_08]: one day, 24 hours, six inches of rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, storm water can be water that's
moving by a slope as well, but six inches
[SPEAKER_08]: of rain in 24 hours is quite significant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's not our a hundred year
storm anymore, but it's still up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can actually store a lot of
water in this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a nominal depth of at least 12 inches
is what we would recommend, although
[SPEAKER_08]: probably 24 would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point is you're looking not just
for storage, but infiltration eventually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so under, under the aggregate,
you'd want the water to slowly go into the
[SPEAKER_08]: ground as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get your planting soil,
your storage, and then eventually down
[SPEAKER_08]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 12 inches of gravel, a 35% porosity
gives you at 4.2 inches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of water stored and the deeper you make
it, you get up to 6.3 with 18 inches of
[SPEAKER_08]: aggregate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really have a capacity to store
water where you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_08]: flooding happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: So after we have our, you know,
gravel and our perp pipe, and then we had
[SPEAKER_08]: a geotech, we put a design soil,
meaning that was blended of sand,
[SPEAKER_08]: loam, and compost to have a pretty sandy
loam mix with about 8% organic matter,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are trying to balance out the
infiltration and the support of plant
[SPEAKER_08]: growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is only five feet wide.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, and it's got to deal with,
as we'll see, salt and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_08]: issues in terms of its narrowness.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 2014 with my class, we planted it in
the autumn of the 14th.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the drop curves here where the
water is coming off the road into the
[SPEAKER_08]: bioswale and basically filling up that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about it today,
but there are monitoring wells as a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually look at things like
water temperature and the issues of
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And quality, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's educational.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is that we expect that the
water going in here will be cleansed by
[SPEAKER_08]: the microorganisms of the soil and be
filtered by the organic matter and the
[SPEAKER_08]: gravel itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, this is a quarter mile long.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did this all in one afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had volunteers, about 40 students.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, this is the idea of water coming
off the road.
[SPEAKER_08]: And through the drop curve into the
planting area and then being stored and
[SPEAKER_08]: then eventually released to the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And plants are important part of this,
just a quickly looking at what plants do
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of stormwater.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got precipitation and we got a
runoff here, but about in a canopy,
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it's a shrub or tree canopy,
if it's a light rainfall, about 65% of
[SPEAKER_08]: that rain will be entrained or trapped by
the leaves themselves and then evaporated
[SPEAKER_08]: back to the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can actually, you know,
when it's light rain, you want to stay out
[SPEAKER_08]: of the rain, you'd go under a tree as long
as it's not lightning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you get through fall eventually,
you get evapotranspiration from the ground
[SPEAKER_08]: through the tree, water being lost and
used, and we get water going into the
[SPEAKER_08]: ground infiltration.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's things stored there as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all these different activities actually
help.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant helps in a great way.
[SPEAKER_08]: To reduce stormwater by using the water
and trapping it and slowing it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why use plants?
[SPEAKER_08]: The roots of plants actually provide
infiltration channels.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been shown that when you have roots
and plants, water goes down much more
[SPEAKER_08]: quickly than if it's just straight soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: They take up pollutants like heavy metals,
help to hold the soils together,
[SPEAKER_08]: reducing erosion, slow runoff,
reduce suspended solids, which is part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the cleansing, add aesthetic value,
improve air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to look at that for one minute,
aesthetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes we choose plants,
you know, for the sake of having plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for about 90% or 99% of the
population, what they're really seeing is
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant selection, the plant quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's got to look good too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's nothing but, I mean,
it's not just a question of having
[SPEAKER_08]: stormwater runoff reduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do reduce the urban heat island,
sequester carbon, plants hold carbon,
[SPEAKER_08]: they bring in carbon dioxide, and increase
biodiversity and creating wildlife
[SPEAKER_08]: habitats.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these things, why we use plants in
these installations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here was right after planting in
September of 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see the infiltration basins,
which are across up and down this whole
[SPEAKER_08]: quarter mile long stretch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of different plants there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it snowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we had winter 2015.
[SPEAKER_08]: And okay, a little snow is an insulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't worried about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as things got worse, I mean,
this was also what it looked like a little
[SPEAKER_08]: later.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there are plants under there,
but it got really, you know, salt and
[SPEAKER_00]: crusted and- It's a good moment to think
about plant crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do plants come back after
they've had big loads and have- Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we plow the roads and the
sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it goes right in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we thought about that before we
planted, before we chose the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what the site looked like in
the next year, early in the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then later in the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: So plants do come back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.
[SPEAKER_08]: After the snow melts and we can see the
plants, we do cut them back, taking out
[SPEAKER_08]: dead stems and damaged stems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we cut some things back just to the
ground very simply so that they can reduce
[SPEAKER_08]: the size.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because some of these things are a little
bit taller than we'd like.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what it looked like this morning,
walking by.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's about- Mature now,
it's about, some of the plants are three,
[SPEAKER_08]: three and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's about where we want them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't want to get something too tall
where there'd be a- So often Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities gets a complaint that the
plants touched me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to cut them back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They touched me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we want to- Non-emotional.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what it looks like this
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to make sure that's going
to go through your slide.
[SPEAKER_08]: But these are- We took salt readings in
the soil over different times.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is anything over this pink line,
which is 1.5 millimhoes, is toxic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were having, after snow events,
we were having quite a lot of toxicity in
[SPEAKER_08]: the soil in terms of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has a no ice policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine the flip side of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of crunchy salt.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's more interesting this year,
we had a little different situation where,
[SPEAKER_08]: as you know, April was really cold.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of snow in April,
which is more difficult for plants because
[SPEAKER_08]: they're starting to wake up and now they
get hit by a lot of snow and salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just along the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to look at where most of the
salt coming from the road or from the
[SPEAKER_08]: sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we looked at- tested both sides.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the blue is the sidewalk side of the
bioswale.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much more salt coming off of the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all that salt that was being put on the
road from the sidewalk to prevent icing
[SPEAKER_08]: was going right into the bioswale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop one minute and have you
imagine, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I respond to what we just said?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need two answers, otherwise we're not
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we do when we have so much salt?
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what do we do in anticipation of having
conditions like this?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Explore salt-free or low-salt alternatives
for melting ice.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I brought that up to campus.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said just on this road, because there's
calcium magnesium acetate.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just on this stretch, can't we just do
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, well, if you buy it,
we'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In anticipation of knowing something like
this, this is not unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do when you design?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the salt that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and- That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to happen when it rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more than two answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt-tolerant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else about plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt-tolerance and something else that is
going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know the answer, but they didn't
even do the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Greg Karnick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the answer to the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'm thinking about drug tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have a question about the
graph, because I don't understand how to
[SPEAKER_05]: read 6 milliohms per- Good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's in that ground, salt?
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, we take salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, background is down here, below 1.
[SPEAKER_08]: So above 1.5, it becomes toxic to plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's millimos per centimeter
squared.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we take soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: We make a solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll do it in our class.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll drop an electrode in,
and we'll measure the salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other issue I would be concerned
about is using evergreen plants where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get foliar drugged.
[SPEAKER_08]: So deciduous plants that don't have any
leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the salt is going to- This goes
back to- It's going to be- Water below the
[SPEAKER_00]: root side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want good infiltration to move that
salt away.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we get late snowfalls, like April,
and that's the time when you get the most
[SPEAKER_08]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have salt tolerant plants,
but are also evergreen, and have all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of foliar drugged.
OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what plants we best?
[SPEAKER_08]: Herbaceous plants require pruning to
remove dead foliage.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not something we want to work with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Woody plants require less pruning,
reducing the overall amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: maintenance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And use plants that tolerate wet and dry
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets back to your point, Zach,
that because these soils aren't so
[SPEAKER_00]: well-drained, they have to- And this is
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in basins like this will think
about wet tolerance, but they won't think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what happens in August when there's-
Not this August.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, when there's 15,
20 days of no rain, with droughty soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants have to be ACDC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's true that most bioswales I see are
planted with wet tolerant plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not thinking that there are times when it
doesn't rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are well-infiltrating soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you need to have a plant that's going
to be drought-tolerant as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have the full range of ability to tolerate
those two conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So rain gardens, I'm just going to make
the point.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen these kind of depression rain
gardens.
[SPEAKER_08]: In areas which take in water and hopefully
infiltrate it into the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of herbaceous plants here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problem is during the winter time,
in the winter time, a lot of the plants
[SPEAKER_08]: just have no structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to cut them back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a muddy hole.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we tend to use woody plants which have
structure in the winter and look like
[SPEAKER_08]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't collapse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't collapse.
[SPEAKER_08]: So not something I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_08]: People do use herbaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: They make a good summer show, but then the
winter, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you better have maintenance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So best plants, both wet and dry tolerant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to see some of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: Salix repens, creeping willow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a willow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it does tolerate wet, actually
saturated conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's one of those willows that go
actually very drought-tolerant as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ruse copulina.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a great shining sumac,
prairie flame is one cultivar we use,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is really dwarf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shining sumac straight species can be
quite tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted something about three feet max.
[SPEAKER_08]: And prairie flame is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that all along the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chameleon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll show you a picture of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bacchus have a little nepholia,
eastern ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we sometimes try to mimic landscapes
which have this kind of salty,
[SPEAKER_08]: drought, wet condition.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of coastal areas have this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bacchus is one of these plants that's
native from northern Florida up to
[SPEAKER_08]: Massachusetts on the coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blooming now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blooming right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally unexpected.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorbis, sorbifolia, falsa aurelia,
borrella, hippofa, rhamnoides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hippofa is a sea buckthorn.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's European.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's used if you buy the big ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have fruit, and it's used to make
juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a male dwarf, no flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you'll be really
disappointed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a coastal in Europe all up and
down the coast from Norway through to
[SPEAKER_08]: central Europe on coastal areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cephalanthus is our native button bush.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pretty big plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And interestingly, it's thought of as we
see it in wet, boggy areas in the
[SPEAKER_08]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it also colorates fairly droughty
soil, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the straight species can be up to five
or six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sugarshack is a cultivar which has red
fruit and is much more compact than dwarf.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cultivar wall, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cultivar wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So morrella, we used to call this myrica.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bayberry is something we all know about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great in terms of salt tolerance and wet
and dry tolerance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the plant that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it send the evergreen around here?
[SPEAKER_08]: It stays till December with the leaves on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a great plant for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is rus copulina, shining sumac.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is the creeping willow,
salix repens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: We look at salix repens in the wind.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sort of has a beautiful texture
and feel to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is rus copulina in full color.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is where you see in the coastal area
here, growing right in the coastal New
[SPEAKER_08]: York, for that matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just has this funny little bit of leaf
on the rachis of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of very unusual, a beautiful
red, red fall color.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's a colonizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It spreads.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of these plants are fighting it
out on the bioswale.
[SPEAKER_08]: We expected that to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are going to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some are going to lose.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hippophae ramnoides sprite.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is dwarf sea buckthorn.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a real beautiful gray leaf plant
that's done exceptionally salt tolerant.
[SPEAKER_08]: This you could actually water with salt
water, and it would be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a sea side plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is Baccharis helimifolia,
which is a native on the coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you may not be so familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes in male and female plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's daecious.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the male.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has all the stamens.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the female showing actually
the seeds that are starting to form from
[SPEAKER_08]: the pollination of the male.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get a bunch of Baccharis,
and you'll get some male, some female.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does sow seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is except it's just starting to
bloom now, but very late to bloom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this, again, is a sea side plant that
thrives in droughty and wet, salty soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Cephalanthus buttonbush.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our native plant that you see in
wet areas here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be quite big.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beautiful in terms of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's big for our five foot wide 18
inches of soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we prefer to use a sugar shack,
which has the red fruit, as you'll see
[SPEAKER_08]: here, much more compact and more.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's important to select the plants not
just based on species, but on color.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the envelope of planting, the envelope
of soil that you have to support these
[SPEAKER_08]: plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we learned, best season to plant,
we plant it in the autumn.
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't a good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: These plants had not got really
established before the snow came.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'd always do it in the spring,
let them get established in the summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, I mean, it's the same plants are
out there, but we found that they did
[SPEAKER_08]: better once we did spring planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they established.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plant for canopy closure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canopy closure is when the plants knit
together or touch each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to have bare soil,
because bare soil gives us weeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when you have canopy closure,
much less in terms of weeds and
[SPEAKER_08]: maintenance that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to cut back dormant stems in early
spring to control height eventually.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all these plants come back very
rigorously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to remove salt damage stems.
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, we had a lot of salt damage
stems because of the late snowfall and the
[SPEAKER_08]: late salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: So quick overview of the Tower Road
bioswale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to see one other bioswale,
which is the rice bowls, called that
[SPEAKER_08]: because rice hull parking lots discharge
into this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just as soon as hearing up here,
there were three segments to redevelop
[SPEAKER_00]: parking lot here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no traditional storm drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cross pitch into three basins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time Cornell built these,
they put turf in them, lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And staff hated it, hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had side slopes like this,
and they were intending to mow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maintenance was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a year or two, we took this on as
our class project, both to remediate the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil as well as to plant these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see, we really can't
reinforce enough that we need to plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole idea that plants are objects,
it's plants in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to walk around every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK that they touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that after a year or two
of mulching and maintaining, that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively self-maintaining.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to see a little video.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_08]: For three and a half minutes or so of the
rice bowls.
[SPEAKER_08]: More volunteers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was three deep bowls, which were rice
hull parking lot discharged into.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all turf initially.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very compacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ground spokes hated to mow it because it
was very steep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a sand trench running through
the bottom of each of these bowls.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we needed to make the soil appropriate
for plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was so compact that we couldn't get
plants in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we use a technique called scoop and
dump, where we add six inches of compost.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then with a backhoe, go down and take
that mixed soil up and dump it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And best to just show you how we did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a mending in situ.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we volunteer?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're taking compost.
[SPEAKER_08]: And spreading it about six inches thick in
the deep wild soil is what you see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't need to have 40 students to
do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be done by machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, then it pours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it pours.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't let them go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just letting you know if it's pouring
outside right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, you see the flags to prevent
getting into the roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we go down with a backhoe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scoop and dump right in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this compacted soil is kind of having
veins of compost through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not uniformly mixed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get this kind of veins of compost and
also increases infiltration.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done research on this over 12 years,
showing that by doing this, we actually
[SPEAKER_08]: get better results over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So notice it's pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't load it to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to keep it in this kind of state
where we have veins of infiltration of
[SPEAKER_08]: compost and compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: We plant right into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to mulch on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll look perfectly wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we won't have messed around with the
soil more than we had to.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, we believe in having our
students be physically fit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hands on, nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is spring of 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after it was planted was May 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a long three bioswales here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Four months later, it's now September.
[SPEAKER_08]: And things are starting to grow in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a rice parking lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are infiltration zones into this
one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheets across.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curb is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just cross pitches directly into you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where it comes in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Into a gravel area and then moves 14
months later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next spring, things are starting to really
grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't stress enough how important soil
preparation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Soil makeup preparation is key to having
these things work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plant selection is key.
[SPEAKER_08]: But without soil, all the plant selection
in the world goes down to tubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was a couple of summers ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really.
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of these are woody plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And very unusual group of plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some are, again, wet tolerant and drought
tolerant, especially on the bottoms of the
[SPEAKER_08]: swales, where we really will get more
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the sides, you can get away with less
wet tolerant plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a few grasses, only because
when they
[SPEAKER_08]: start to grow, they start to get wet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to try to show you another
infiltration practice, which has now been
[SPEAKER_08]: going on for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a proposed parking lot area near
the inlet downtown Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a trail here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city wanted to have a trailhead
parking area that was much better
[SPEAKER_08]: functioning instead of this muddy area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we were working on something called
structural soil, which is a gravel soil
[SPEAKER_08]: mix, which is very highly infiltrating.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, well, let's try porous asphalt
and impervious asphalt and look at
[SPEAKER_08]: structural soil and planting trees in here
to see how this works.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's now 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've done a lot of this practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So structural soil, we took off all that
top of the existing parking lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went down 24 inches with structural
soil, which is a mixture of stone and
[SPEAKER_08]: soil, very highly infiltration,
very fast infiltration, even when
[SPEAKER_08]: compacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: So structural soil, the essence of it is
that when compacted, it holds up pavement,
[SPEAKER_08]: sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be compacted to 95% proctor with no
problem of plant roots getting through it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a combination of load bearing and
root infiltration.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what you're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what's kind of a graphic of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got crushed stone, about one inch.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in between the pores that are created
with the crushed stone of one size,
[SPEAKER_08]: we put soil in that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the soil, because the stone is
touching stone is touching stone,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's where the compactive effort comes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the soil in those pores is not
compact.
[SPEAKER_08]: So roots can just shoot through that and
yet still is a kind of lattice work of
[SPEAKER_08]: load bearing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you understand?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the concept.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so in structural soils, if we can
compact it to the mean porosity is 26%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Soil alone is 34%, not the tiny little
pores.
[SPEAKER_08]: Compact it to proctor density,
high density.
[SPEAKER_08]: The macro pores, the pores that allow
water to infiltrate, however, are very
[SPEAKER_08]: different.
[SPEAKER_08]: In soil alone, we have got 2% of the soil
alone after it's compacted, which has
[SPEAKER_08]: macro pores, which allows it to drain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas in structural soils, 31% of that
after compaction is allowing water to
[SPEAKER_08]: drain through.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our infiltration rate is 24 inches an
hour and less than a half inch in just
[SPEAKER_08]: soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So realize that if you're putting a
pervious situation, a pervious pavement
[SPEAKER_08]: over soil without having something that's
going to allow rapid infiltration,
[SPEAKER_08]: you'll not get any infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it fails, and then people say,
see, porous pavement doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's our pervious asphalt, and this is
our porous asphalt here right next to each
[SPEAKER_08]: other.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get over the aesthetic
porous asphalt.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we saw cut into it and planted right
in the structural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more volunteers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, more volunteers.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it looks like under pavement
compacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's so, you know, it was 2000.
[SPEAKER_08]: Six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't design those barriers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're protected.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, these little, these are one and a
half inch caliper trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see the snow plow coming?
[SPEAKER_08]: Those trees would have been in the next
county.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was protecting my trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so a few years later, doing pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Porous and non-porous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was 2016 from the other side of
the inlet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look back across.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they've now meshed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their canopy is enmeshed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually utilizing a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we see now, and we're going to
have that, is that the ones in the porous
[SPEAKER_08]: asphalt are slightly bigger than those in
the impervious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes sense, because you're getting any
kind of water is going right through the
[SPEAKER_08]: porous asphalt into the structural soil,
whereas in the non-porous, in the
[SPEAKER_08]: impervious asphalt, water has to get into
that little three foot saw cut area before
[SPEAKER_08]: it's going to get into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structural soil around here is made with
crushed limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pH is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to look at plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are plenty of plants that can
tolerate this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This happened to be elms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we then wanted to look at the
roots, but the city didn't like you to dig
[SPEAKER_08]: up everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we used ground penetrating radar to
visualize the roots and the root density
[SPEAKER_08]: under the structural soil, under the
pavement.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is Gary Riffel from Dynamic Tree
Systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we worked together for many years
looking at roots underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was six years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to show you kind of a color
rendering of root density.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here is trees three and four were plan
view.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these stripes basically are passes
with a ground penetrating radar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the color, the hotter the color,
the density, the hotter the color,
[SPEAKER_08]: the more roots in that space.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cooler the color, there's no roots or
very few roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see there's more roots here
next to the trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a lot of places where it's
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot of roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So remember this, because I'm going to
show it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is roots under impervious asphalt,
in structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to show you what roots look
like in pervious asphalt, same with
[SPEAKER_08]: structural soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the root mass, the root density is
much, much greater in structural soil with
[SPEAKER_08]: pervious asphalt.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if the trees weren't growing well,
you're getting a lot of stormwater
[SPEAKER_08]: recharge.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is 24 inches of structural soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: No need for a gravel base, because it is
basically as old as it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Open as a base.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it has 31% porosity and pretty well
similar to just aggregate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we would get six inches of rainfall
held under the pavement here and then
[SPEAKER_08]: allowed to go back into the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other message is that roots do
penetrate structural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not contained in the good
horticultural soil, which is the white
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_08]: The blue line is in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an area where there's no more
structural soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the structural soil is put in an
area and then that was it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they went back to regular soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: The grouping in the porous spot is all
more even and dense than in the other
[SPEAKER_05]: part, which is more scattered.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the issue is water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So structural soil is very well drained.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how do you get the water in?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Structural soil is great, but you still
have to get the water in to the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where porous asphalt or porous
paving makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and I'm just going to end with this,
which is our newest part of our
[SPEAKER_08]: sustainability trail, which is a totally
porous asphalt parking lot, which we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be planting a week from Thursday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our class is planting this and this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is all porous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And under is an apron around the planting
area of like eight or 10 feet of
[SPEAKER_08]: structural soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the ability for roots to get out
of this planting area.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is regular soil in here and explore
more volume.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the whole area, while allowing
for load bearing of that pavement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell got a big grant to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inspiration for the grant,
the design was done in part by Valentina,
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, put your hand there,
did all the graphics that assisted Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: in getting this.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a green infrastructure grant
program, New York State.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a green infrastructure
project, you can apply for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as long as you document everything and
keep water on site, it's mostly about
[SPEAKER_08]: stormwater, you can get funds to do these
built projects, which is what Cornell did.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any questions that we are with,
we're going to go outside and see some of
[SPEAKER_08]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I think our office, Andy, you could
speak to that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not at all unusual to do
porous asphalt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or permeable pavers too, as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking the type that they poured
on, like up at Saganic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think what you're talking about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's porous concrete, which is
different than porous asphalt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So porous asphalt is fairly common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Porous concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, we needed an 80 car parking
lot at the hospital, which is still
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_08]: People say, well, you have to clean out
porous asphalt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Porous asphalt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Porous concrete is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on, I think it was less
perfected.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of spalling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a scalable issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't, it's hard to do two parking
spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with porous asphalt, people say,
well, don't you have to clean it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such an incredible rate of
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you lose 50%, you're still going
to have very fast infiltration.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some debris, some dust gets in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you don't want to do is have anybody
sand the parking lot for snows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Salt is fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to go through.
[SPEAKER_08]: But sand will clog up the pores.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: During construction to get soil erosion,
that's the biggest killer.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to clog up the pores.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, we've had many of the hospital,
downtown Ithaca, the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this new parking lot, which we just
built and will be planting next week,
[SPEAKER_08]: is all porous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strangely enough, I think this is the
first major porous asphalt area for
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just realize there are some other
porous pavement, resin-based pavements,
[SPEAKER_08]: very expensive porous.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've seen the spec for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It calls for six inches of gravel or
aggregate under that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's much too little.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get gravel of six inches and with a
porous surface, when it gets to the point
[SPEAKER_08]: where you hit the compacted soil,
that just water is going to just go up or
[SPEAKER_08]: move.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's any slope to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you need a reasonable reservoir of
aggregate to hold the storm water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Rice Bowl example, as the canopy
closure occurs, does the need for mulching
[SPEAKER_01]: and mowing go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no mowing, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no grass there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we mulch for the first few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Until we get canopy closure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the leaves create the mulch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we sometimes, if there's a little
bit, just for aesthetics or more water
[SPEAKER_08]: holding, we might mulch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or an edge condition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Edges are always difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get canopy right to the edge.
[SPEAKER_08]: But adding organics, we put a lot of
organic in when we do this scoop and dump.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that will decompose, and that will
be eaten by our microorganisms over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll have subsidence.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we found through our research that if
we add mulch every year until we get
[SPEAKER_08]: plants creating their own mulch,
we won't lose organic matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the residential installation side
of landscaping.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally speaking, customers,
I'm in Washington, DC area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're very aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have disposable income,
typically.
[SPEAKER_05]: They understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're willing or interested in doing
the permeable driveways and things along
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: But cost is generally the issue in the
comparison between traditional bathing
[SPEAKER_05]: services and traditional preparation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume on the asphalt, on the concrete
side, the cost is also a stomach block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's partly the porous asphalt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much the asphalt itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're excavating 24 inches
versus 8 inches, there's both excavation
[SPEAKER_00]: and base course material, which really
adds up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be municipal regulation,
ultimately, that would drive this because
[SPEAKER_05]: the consumer's not driving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to decide that a runoff is
a critical issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing we wanted, before I
forget, we provided a handout over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go online.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of these things are online.
[SPEAKER_08]: The videos, booklets about the plants,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little handout that will get
you in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a big website, which all this
information is there for free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please take it and utilize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go look around.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of things to see on that
website.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing, one thing we also have
noticed with porous asphalt is that you
[SPEAKER_08]: have to have a big enough job because the
asphalt plants have to clean out a bay to
[SPEAKER_08]: put this new mix in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's too small, it's a cost to
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a bigger project would be more cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, contractors are getting used to
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, 15 years ago, it was a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's becoming second nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they making porous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they don't put fines in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most asphalt, as you saw from that
picture, the porous looked really chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally in asphalt, you get a big
range of sand particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small to larger, like number ones,
twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just use number twos and stick them
together like caramel corn, then you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just holding it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the tumens which hold it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's no few fines in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're generalizing all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough for an audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us are here from watershed
regions, really focusing on the harmful
[SPEAKER_04]: algal blooms and trying to find ways to
mitigate our stormwater runoff in
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is the state responding to this kind
of mitigation when looking at the $65
[SPEAKER_04]: million that have been put into harmful
algal blooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ultimately, DEC determines
acceptable practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do now accept?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there were infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it keeps changing, right,
Andy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the state requires or allows for in
terms of practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to keep up to date with DEC
acceptable practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is kind of checking off of
that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm curious, that grant for the
proposal that is up here, did you include
[SPEAKER_02]: harmful algal bloom prevention as a part
of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this was done a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to decide where the
nearest water bodies are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these things are not this
overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're a part of a bigger set of
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find any practice that
solves for all the things that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're getting a lot of organic
runoff that's just feeding the algal
[SPEAKER_08]: blooms, you need to find out where that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and sometimes it's agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's homeowners that fertilize
gratuitously, because scots told me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to put it down in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to put it down in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rinks you and Malene.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, that's when you have
exceptional organic runoff is when you get
[SPEAKER_08]: the algal blooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we can get all that runoff in the
ground, it would reduce that problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a bigger problem than just one
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys ever introduced irrigation
to a bioswale?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like irrigating a green roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you start to wonder,
why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we do it to establish the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but not permanently.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just be initial maybe one year in
a dry spell while the plants are getting
[SPEAKER_08]: their roots in the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, establishment period.
[SPEAKER_08]: After that, choice of plants and the
choice of soil should be able to handle
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't irrigate, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, otherwise, it's sort of
counterintuitive in terms of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, choosing wet and dry tolerant
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once they're established, it's not
initial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you plant, again, they're still in
their pots or whatever, and their roots
[SPEAKER_08]: haven't really explored that soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once they've had a year or so to do that,
then they really take over.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really get all that runoff in terms
of their ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
