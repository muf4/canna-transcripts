[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for joining today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to present on One
Health, and you'll see why in a moment of
[SPEAKER_00]: why I'm really passionate about this
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get us started though, my slides will
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you a little bit about
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Sharon Toth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a county 4-H agent in Hunterdon
County, New Jersey, which I realize when I
[SPEAKER_00]: say that, that doesn't mean anything
unless you're from New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's this little red dot over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Borders, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm about 15 minutes from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work for Rutgers Cooperative
Extension or Rutgers University.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our land-grant institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received my Bachelor of Science in
Evolutionary Anthropology from Rutgers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then my PhD in Biological Anthropology
from the University of Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to say that I transform lives
by merging researcher methodologies with
[SPEAKER_00]: educator techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like a lot of people represent
that through my talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my background always looks like why,
how did I get into 4-H with an
[SPEAKER_00]: anthropology degree?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because I was a lifelong 4-H-er,
and I really valued the experiences that I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned in 4-H and through Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to bring back that
information to my community that I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my presentation today is going to have
three main areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to define what One Health is and
why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about what I did during
my research days as a PhD student,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how I apply that to being a
county 4-H agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is One Health?
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep using this term, but what does it
really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a collaborative or
interconnectedness of human, animal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multidisciplinary approach that
recognizes that the health of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, and the environment are all
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not siloed from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings together experts from all
different fields, from human medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: veterinary medicine, environmental
science, and beyond to solve complex
[SPEAKER_00]: health problems like zoonotic diseases,
food safety, and climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some examples that we see of One Health
and how we see it every day in our society
[SPEAKER_00]: is avian flu.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very prominent right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID, rabies, West Nile virus,
Lyme's disease, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, salmonella, listeria, climate
change, contamination, deforestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have an impact on human
health, animal health, and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all interconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Venn diagram, I believe, does a
really great job of representing how One
[SPEAKER_00]: Health connects together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a simplified version I really
like to educate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows cows grazed next to a lettuce
field, and cows can carry E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli but still look healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli from cow manure in the nearby farm
can contaminate the lettuce field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then people eat contaminated lettuce
and can become infected with E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and then serious illness or even
sometimes death can result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a really simplified
version of how those animals, health,
[SPEAKER_00]: human, animal, and the environment all
connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite examples is that of the
development of insulin for diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a life-saving example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the anatomical and clinical
similarities in the dog and human
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreas, it aided in the development of
insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 1920s, scientists study
dogs to understand how the pancreas
[SPEAKER_00]: regulates blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They discovered that removing the pancreas
caused diabetes, and that insulin from
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy pancreases could restore balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a major medical breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research directly led to the first
effective treatment for diabetes in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, saving millions of lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early insulin was made using pancreases
from cows and pigs, and it was turning
[SPEAKER_00]: that fatal disease into a manageable one
people can live with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This connects to the environment though
because early production relied on animal
[SPEAKER_00]: byproducts, linking insulin to agriculture
and livestock practices, but eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns over supply and sustainability
led to biotech innovations that now
[SPEAKER_00]: produce synthetic insulin that still today
is used for millions of lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then why people who have diabetes can
continue on living a normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally like that model because
it does use a dog model, and this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I used in my research when I was a PhD
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times when we think of animal
models, we may think of using pigs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that a lot, or maybe mice,
but different animal models exist for
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for dogs, it's specifically interesting
because they share 80% of diseases with
[SPEAKER_00]: us, and mostly of the nearly 400 inherited
disorders characterized in dogs are
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make them an excellent model for
numerous human diseases, such as cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: osteoarthritis, aging, and for me,
it was knee ligament rupture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I studied the ACL in the knee,
and I'll go into that a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a very similar structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the gold standard for us,
and it has it because of the histological
[SPEAKER_00]: similarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with dogs, beyond sharing similar
diseases, they are a useful model due to
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in diverse environments like
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They share the same environments with us,
so they're exposed to the same bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollutants, and toxins, and they exhibit
breed-specific diseases, some that are
[SPEAKER_00]: very rare in humans, like sarcomas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the appearance of
spontaneous diseases as opposed to being
[SPEAKER_00]: induced like in mice, and they age five to
eight times faster than humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: aiding in a disease timeline, allowing for
observation of disease onset and condensed
[SPEAKER_00]: study time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs are also the most physically diverse
species and have the most known naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring diseases of all land mammals
after humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use them to study the ACL in the knee
because of all these similarities and
[SPEAKER_00]: their usefulness in modeling human
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main intention of my study was to
correlate biological variables in ACL
[SPEAKER_00]: rupture patterns by using comparative
anatomy of human and dog knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predisposition factors for non-contact
ACL rupture is not really well understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the force-twisting motion of
this ligament in the knee does not produce
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent rupture patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research aids to reduce future ACL
rupture incidence rates while mutually
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting humans and animal medicine
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we hear the dog term CCL
versus ACL.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called homologous structures,
which means they have similar structures
[SPEAKER_00]: due to shared ancestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And comparable to humans, some dogs
rupture this ligament at a greater rate
[SPEAKER_00]: than others, and 80% of ruptures are
non-contact, similar to that 70% in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, and we see that in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that spayed female dogs are at the
highest risk of CCL rupture, and both
[SPEAKER_00]: spayed or neutered dogs, regardless of
sex, have significantly higher rupture
[SPEAKER_00]: rates than sexually intact dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for these rupture
disparities in dogs is unknown like in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this all important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we care about our knee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just say, we'll brace it and
it'll be fine?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because muscle skeletal conditions
affect 1.7 billion people in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it contributes to nearly 166 million
years lived with disability and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest proportion of persistent pain in
all geographical regions and age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscle skeletal conditions are the leading
cause of disability worldwide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason for early leave or
retirement from work contributing to less
[SPEAKER_00]: financial security is also a lack of
physical activity can contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: decline mental health and physical health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knee injuries are also the second most
commonly injured site after the ankle,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ACL ruptures accounting for over
50% of those injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men account for the majority of ACL
ruptures, but women are more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: rupture it at a two to eight times greater
rate, while surgical interventions or
[SPEAKER_00]: rehab or common practice, only about 50%
of people will return to their full
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-injury state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this increases rehabilitation and
surgical costs and less chance of full
[SPEAKER_00]: sports reintegration or even mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a female, I find this specifically
interesting because they're at a two times
[SPEAKER_00]: greater rate to rupture their ACL,
and especially for ages 15 to 19 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And female sports participation has
increased more than 1,000% since the
[SPEAKER_00]: passing of Title IX, that where all
institutions that receive federal money
[SPEAKER_00]: must offer equal access to curricular and
extracurricular activities for men and
[SPEAKER_00]: women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nearly 8 million students currently
participate in high school sports,
[SPEAKER_00]: with continuously rising numbers over the
past 29 years, and female participation on
[SPEAKER_00]: an all time high with more than 3.4
million athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increase in female participation
suggests ACL studies prior to Title IX
[SPEAKER_00]: were really focused only on men,
and that we don't have an equal
[SPEAKER_00]: representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only in the past 30 years,
since 1993, did the NIH mandate that their
[SPEAKER_00]: funds be used for women and men in their
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, women only represent 4% of
orthopedic surgeons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout this study, I use the Golden
Retriever Lifetime Study done by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Morris Research Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found was that it was a
multifactorial process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no one cause for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hormone regulations played a
large piece, which is impacted by our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that impacted growth and development
on bone structure and how we function and
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really quick summary of what
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do I apply this all?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that have to do with extension?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I apply this to my 4-H teaching?
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I implement one of the most popular 4-H
curriculum that we see, which is 4-H
[SPEAKER_00]: embryology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very popular across the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where youth hatch eggs in the
classroom to learn about growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this relates directly to one health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the animal perspective,
youth are getting investment in another
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing the growth and development
of an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: From humans, they're also seeing the zoo
genetic diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're learning about biosecurity and the
importance of maintaining a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for the animals and
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the environment especially,
they're seeing how the environment impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I saw in my dissertation research,
how development impacts our bone
[SPEAKER_00]: structures and hormonal impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same here with embryology,
just on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also talk about sustainable farming
and food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we be sustainable farmers while
we produce food to feed our nation and our
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also do a workshop called Bone
Viage, exploring domestication through
[SPEAKER_00]: bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background in anatomy and osteology,
which is where workshops where
[SPEAKER_00]: participants learned about domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that animal and human perspective,
they're learning about the symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, the shared relationship we
have with each other and how we prove
[SPEAKER_00]: improved health with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We helped animals improve their health,
but they also helped us through
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we talk about the impact on
bone preservation, which is the term
[SPEAKER_00]: tephanomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it so hard, like you can see in
this photo, to recognize when an animal
[SPEAKER_00]: has been domesticated?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no defined aspect that goes,
this animal has been domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very gradual change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do a workshop where youth get to
work with bones hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, they're holding a horse
femur, and they get to understand what the
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomy looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use paper cutouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get to create their own animal
after they make the original animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one here is a beaver, a rabbit,
and a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to give the background
information of why they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a pug here because we
talked about that improved health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dogs being that highly diverse species,
they're being the most diverse species on
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, it's because we bred them so
widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pugs have that flat face, it's called
brachiocephalic, and why they have hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives us a lot of information on
respiratory diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have an animal science
program in your county, that's all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: One Health still applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can talk about One Health and 4-H
technologies, such as AI's impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about AI, you can talk
about the benefits and dangers to society,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the AI data centers take a lot of water
and power to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this talking about while they might
benefit us, it can really endanger our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to talk about this
all-encompassing product of human,
[SPEAKER_00]: animal, and environmental health together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not siloed from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my information if you would like to
contact me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to quickly drop this
link into the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind, it's a two-question
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love for you to take time to answer
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sharon, I have a quick question for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you bring to life the contemporary
issue of bird flu with climate change and
[SPEAKER_01]: One Health?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sort of give us that sort of
synopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you rephrase?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bird flu and the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How climate change and bird flu are coming
together from a One Health perspective of
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the avian flu being so prominent now,
we know it's a zoonotic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans, birds, and swine can spread
through each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're not seeing many cases in the
disease spreading to humans, there have
[SPEAKER_00]: been cases even in our county where it was
found in feral cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environment plays a part because
most of avian flu is being spread by
[SPEAKER_00]: wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they fly over a chicken coop and
they poop and it comes down into your
[SPEAKER_00]: coop, that's spreading the disease
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having precautions and biosecurity
is the big thing of protecting your coop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure if you walk, you go to
visit somebody's coop, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not wearing the same type of shoes
that you wear to your coop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your coop, those are the only shoes that
ever go to your coop and that they stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever go to somebody else's,
you make sure to sanitize and clean for
[SPEAKER_00]: the safety and reduces the spread of that
disease elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know if I was not clear on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
