[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill Gillian for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for everyone who's taken
time to meet with me in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been really an incredible experience
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to more interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Chris already mentioned social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do me a favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on Twitter, take out your phone
and follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Brady.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I follow half of you at least
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like many here, I'm really passionate
about science communication, science
[SPEAKER_03]: outreach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thrilled to see so many students and
faculty and staff engaged in science
[SPEAKER_03]: outreach and science communication here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really critical that
scientists actually talk science beyond
[SPEAKER_03]: our academies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll follow back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want a live tweet, you've got
my permission to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've had a lot of really great
conversations while I've been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of time interacting with students,
which I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the conversations that we've had
is, how did you as a student get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: field of plant pathology?
[SPEAKER_03]: And repeatedly, I'm hearing that it's so
important that a student knows a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: pathologist, that a student has a research
interaction, an internship, or takes a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant path course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that seems like a really important way
to get into this field that we really
[SPEAKER_03]: think of as a discovery field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for me, my path was a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But while I've never actually studied at
Cornell, Cornell has played a really
[SPEAKER_03]: prominent role in where I'm at today,
in a way that's probably not very obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually grew up on a grape farm,
Concord grape farm in southwest Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I was 10 years old,
I was really an active gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started reading a magazine called
Rodale's Organic Gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, back then, this was, I'm stating
myself here, but in the mid-80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And organic gardening was not a thing,
at least in southwest Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember my father pulling me aside
and saying, organic gardening doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something the hippies do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't waste your time on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearly, he was wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I read this magazine religiously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned a lot about gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned a lot about plant science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it was the pages of organic
gardening that taught me that I could
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have a career as a plant
scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the names that kept coming up
over and over and over again was Henry
[SPEAKER_03]: Munger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you don't know, does anyone not
know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a rough question,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, Henry Munger was an
important plant breeder and a professor at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason, he was very well
featured in this magazine back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: mid-1980s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he really, more than anyone,
I think, influenced my decision to go into
[SPEAKER_03]: plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, this magazine and his career
lit a passion in me that continues to this
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always had a soft spot for this
institution because of that connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really an honor to share with you
our research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work at the plant end of plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the hallmarks of our work has been
mining crop wild relatives or wild species
[SPEAKER_03]: related to crop plants for useful genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really work in the area of the
genomics of plant disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of my goals is to use gene bank
collections to identify genes for crop
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement so that they're more resistant
to pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for many, many years, I've worked in
the potato late-light pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a plant pathologist,
I'm sure you already know this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the causal agent of the Irish
potato famine or the European potato
[SPEAKER_03]: famine of the 1840s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a plant disease coupled with social
factors that made an Irish population
[SPEAKER_03]: almost wholly dependent on potato for
their existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had some really bad years in the
1840s, really intense late-light epidemics
[SPEAKER_03]: in potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: A million people starved to death.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Ireland, a million more left the
country, including the ancestors of John
[SPEAKER_03]: F.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quite literally, if it hadn't been for
this plant disease, the US probably never
[SPEAKER_03]: would have had a president called JFK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this disease, which was so important
in the 1840s, is still one of the leading
[SPEAKER_03]: biotic constraints of potato production
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: The price tag is somewhere in the
neighborhood of $5 to $8 billion annually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really is a very significant
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the efforts that my group has
focused on over the years, and we're one
[SPEAKER_03]: of many labs around the world to do this,
is the discovery of genetic resistance to
[SPEAKER_03]: late-light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to give you a visual of just how
devastating this disease can be,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to share with you a month in the
life of potato late-light nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a research plot at the
University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't use fungicides here at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We intentionally release the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use overhead irrigation to maintain
high humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the pathogen's happy,
a field that looks like this can turn into
[SPEAKER_03]: a field that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now obviously, the majority of the plants
in this field, the breeding lines of the
[SPEAKER_03]: potato cultivars, are susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are a few islands of green,
such as those shown there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And more often than not, those islands of
green are wild species of potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of the species that my
group has worked on over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it originates.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one originated from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the materials from a gene bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through phenotypic work such as this,
we're identifying resistance genes that
[SPEAKER_03]: could be incorporated into potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this approach is inherently
phenotype-driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's slow and laborious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now phenotyping is a lot sexier today than
it was back even a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my colleagues at University of
Minnesota, folks here in many institutions
[SPEAKER_03]: across the globe, are working on remote
imaging as a way of speeding up the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotyping process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're taking pictures of fields with
drones or with field-based apparatus,
[SPEAKER_03]: or we're doing laboratory analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, data collection is one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Data analysis is another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so plant phenotyping is getting much
larger scale, a lot of effort in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: training computers to recognize what plant
disease looks like, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while this is a lot faster and more
high throughput than walking the field and
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for those rare islands of green,
this is also inherently based on plant
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about a wild population of
plants or you think about a gene bank
[SPEAKER_03]: collection, we know there are useful genes
in that set.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also know there are a lot of genes
that aren't useful for crop production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finding a useful disease resistance
gene in a gene bank collection or a wild
[SPEAKER_03]: population of plants is really akin to
finding a needle in a haystack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would argue that plant phenotyping
is always going to be a bottleneck in
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery of useful traits in crop wild
relatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: To give an example, the four pictures you
see here are another wild potato species,
[SPEAKER_03]: selenium polyadenium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from top to bottom, they're grown
under increasing herbicide concentrations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see low or no herbicide
concentrations, very happy plants at the
[SPEAKER_03]: top.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the bottom, the majority of plants have
been killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this plant obviously lacks herbicide
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this study, I really wasn't looking
for herbicide tolerance at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to figure out how to grow
these wild species in my late blight
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery in a way that didn't require hours
and hours of hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something as mundane as how do you
cultivate a wild species becomes a hurdle
[SPEAKER_03]: to discovery of useful traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you can't do it on a large
scale in a phenotype driven approach,
[SPEAKER_03]: something like cultivation is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understanding what late blight resistance
or any resistance phenotype looks like in
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant that is morphologically and
physiologically distinct from crop plants
[SPEAKER_03]: is a hurdle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pathogen race specificity is always a
problem in plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm challenging this with one
particular race of the pathogen festins,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it actually resistant to other races?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, phenotyping is inherently
resource intensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So space, labor funding all represent
hurdles for the application of phenotype
[SPEAKER_03]: driven approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if phenotyping is a bottleneck for the
use of crop wild relatives, what's the
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the last five or seven years,
my group has been working towards
[SPEAKER_03]: utilizing our knowledge of gene function
and advances in DNA sequencing technology
[SPEAKER_03]: to develop genotype driven approaches to
inform phenotyping for trait discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the work I'm going to share with you
today is work that's happening in the Rose
[SPEAKER_03]: ACA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see why in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are probably people in this
room that know this way better than I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in order to make sense of the project
that I'm going to share with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start with a little primer on
how plants recognize and respond to
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plants really have very sophisticated
surveillance systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are multiple different strategies
that plants use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the predominant ways that
plants recognize and respond to pathogens
[SPEAKER_03]: are through genes that we collectively
call resistance genes or R genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And R genes, of course, encode R proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And regardless of the plant species or the
pathogen class against which these genes
[SPEAKER_03]: act, the proteins that they encode share
certain architectures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the predominant superfamily of R genes
encode an NB arc, or nucleotide binding
[SPEAKER_03]: site domain, and a leucine-rich repeat,
or an LRR.
[SPEAKER_03]: So NB LRR superfamily is really very
prominent in terms of plant recognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for the purposes of this talk,
I want you to remember that there are two
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors of NB LRR proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both have NB and LRR domains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they differ in the N term and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're TIR domain here on the bottom,
and a coiled coil or non-TIR type.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are two distinct flavors of NB
LRR genes or NB LRR proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that they have monophyletic
lineages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will become important in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in the plant, NB LRR proteins play
the role of cellular sentinels and
[SPEAKER_03]: switches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are constitutively expressed at
low levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the LRR in particular is involved in
protein-protein binding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through protein-protein binding,
the LRR detects directly or indirectly the
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that happens, so that's the role of
sentinel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that happens, it induces a
protein conformational change that allows
[SPEAKER_03]: the NB arc domain in combination with the
N terminal components to trigger a really
[SPEAKER_03]: elegant cascade of gene expression that
results in the phenotype that we see as
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the LRR plays the role of sentinel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The NB plays the role of switches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in addition to a pretty robust
understanding of how plants recognize and
[SPEAKER_03]: respond to pathogens, we're also living in
an age of really significant advances in
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA sequencing technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a timeline showing whole genome
sequencing in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first plant to be full,
the genome of which was fully sequenced is
[SPEAKER_03]: Arabidopsis back in 2000, followed very
quickly by rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a long time, these were our model
monocot and dicot species.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look out here at 2017,
the rate of discovery, the rate of
[SPEAKER_03]: generation in whole genome sequencing
plants is really a lot more robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got something like 250 plant
genomes that have been fully sequenced at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this project that I'm going to share
with you focuses in the Rosaceae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the key players in terms of
whole genome sequence are the malus
[SPEAKER_03]: domestica or apple genome that was
released first in 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Garia vesca, this is a relative of
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a diploid species called referred to
colloquially as the woodland strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was sequenced in 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then prunus persica or the peach was
sequenced in 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these were the first three of several
genomes that were sequenced in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosaceae.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, we've got a total of 12 Rosaceae
genomes that are publicly available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rose is coming out very soon this fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait to get my hands on it
because the Rose genome, even though the
[SPEAKER_03]: family's called the Rosaceae named for
Rose, Rose has not been sequenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not amongst the 12 that were
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still studying in this particular
study, at least yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the availability of genome resources
for Rosaceae made this a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: candidate for the work that we're
pursuing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we have worked towards trait
discovery, disease resistance discovery in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular, over the years, it's really
been interesting to me that comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics approaches have been rarely
employed for study of disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So comparative genomics are taking
knowledge from one species and applying it
[SPEAKER_03]: to another really has revolutionized many,
many aspects of the plant sciences,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not disease resistance in the NDLR
genes in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many reasons why that's the
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, plant genomes have many NDLR
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a graph that shows the 12 Rosaceae
species that we're studying in this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just plotting the number of NDLR
genes that we found.
[SPEAKER_03]: So way over here on your left is the black
raspberry genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has 43 NDLR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ridiculously small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cucumber, papaya have maybe similar
numbers, but most plants have many dozens
[SPEAKER_03]: or several hundred R genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not a lot of genes in Rubis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast, apple shown here on the
right, 663 NDLR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of R genes in plant
genomes, and the plant genomes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosaceae really vary significantly in
terms of the number of R genes present.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that creates a problem for comparative
approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, NDLR genes evolve very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a slide that my colleague
Nevin Young provided to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nevin for many years has worked in a
model legume known as metacogotroncatula.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his team sequenced a very large number
of accessions of metacogotroncatula.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this graph summarizes diversity of
multi-gene families.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across those various genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The X axis is a measure of synonymous
substitutions across these gene families.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Y axis is a measure of
non-synonymous changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that's down in this quadrant
is relatively slow evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anything up here is very rapidly
evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at these three
individuals, these are domains common in
[SPEAKER_03]: NDLR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got the NB arc, the leucine
retropeat, and the TIR domain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are amongst the most rapidly
evolving components of plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular gene is late nodulin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not an NBLR gene, but it is a protein
that's involved in mediating legume
[SPEAKER_03]: rhizobium interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in general, genes that are involved in
plant-microbe interactions tend to evolve
[SPEAKER_03]: very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense from a biological
perspective because we know that microbes
[SPEAKER_03]: are small, their population numbers are
much larger than we've seen in plant
[SPEAKER_03]: communities, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that the life cycle allows
them to adapt very quickly relative to
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to compensate that,
the plants have figured out how to evolve
[SPEAKER_03]: our genes very rapidly to keep pace with
the microbial populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that these genes evolve really
quickly presents another hurdle for
[SPEAKER_03]: applying comparative genomics approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I've talked already about the general
structure, the conserved architecture of
[SPEAKER_03]: our proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, genes reside on a
chromosome somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's relatively rare to find an NBLR
gene that exists as a single entity on a
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much more often, they occur in clusters of
functionally divergent but
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence-related copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that they're clustered within
the genes genome is really important in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of their evolution because unequal
crossing over within individual genes or
[SPEAKER_03]: within that cluster can really lead to
very rapid changes in the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: structure of these clusters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these clusters can expand and contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see a driver of a really rapid
allelic diversification as a result of
[SPEAKER_03]: this clustering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, in particular, obscures
one-to-one orthological relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of a hallmark of
comparative genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to know that the genes you're
comparing have a common evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, in particular, represents a
really significant complexity in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: applying comparative genomics approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: This graphic actually shows what gene
clustering, NBLR gene clustering,
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like in an actual plant genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is Prunus persica or the peach
genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are eight chromosomes in their rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each bar that you see here is an NBLR
gene that we've identified.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our study, and you can see a really
strong tendency for these genes to cluster
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this really is a very important
mechanism for evolution of these genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to take just a moment to
summarize this idea of comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are three main reasons why we
haven't seen application of comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics approaches for NBLR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, there are many of them
within the plant genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They evolve very rapidly in response to
microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this idea of orthological
relationships are really very rapidly
[SPEAKER_03]: obscured.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm here to tell you that I think
there's a lot of potential for comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics for NBLR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the application of comparative
genomics to this particular gene class can
[SPEAKER_03]: help us identify traits in gene bank
collections for crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working in the Roseaceae.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably don't need to introduce this
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horticulturally very significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also, in addition to being
horticulturally significant, has a very
[SPEAKER_03]: robust phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that everything that we call
Roseaceae today came from a common
[SPEAKER_03]: ancestor that lived about 100 million
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: 59 million years ago, rose, raspberry,
and strawberry diverged from a common
[SPEAKER_03]: ancestor.
[SPEAKER_03]: 52 million years ago, the poms,
so apple and pear, diverged from the stone
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, stone fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: 32 million years ago, apple and pear
diverged from a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that all the stone fruits
today, the cherries, the peaches,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plums, have a common evolutionary
origin that is more recent than 32 million
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't know exactly when that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important that we've got really
robust genome resources for Roseaceae.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a well-established phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this phylogeny also has a really
significant chronological component.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this combination of traits allows
us to ask and answer some really
[SPEAKER_03]: sophisticated questions about trait
evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we're focusing here on
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the last several years,
we've been working in this system to
[SPEAKER_03]: identify ways of essentially a strategy
and a computer pipeline that allows us to
[SPEAKER_03]: make meaningful comparisons across
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Dr. Leon Van Eck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a postdoc working in my group and
he's actually been responsible for much of
[SPEAKER_03]: what I'm going to share with you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, key to our approach to comparative
genomics is recognizing that these gene
[SPEAKER_03]: clusters, while very important
biologically, represent a degree of
[SPEAKER_03]: phylogenetic redundancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our goal is to look at ancient
relationships of our genes and understand
[SPEAKER_03]: how speciation events in the family have
influenced the R gene component in
[SPEAKER_03]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the clusters that we see today we know
are relatively recent in origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that they have a common
evolutionary origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of these genes in a cluster today
could be traced back to a single copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a phylogenetic analytical
perspective, they're really redundant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've opted to collapse these into a
single composite sequence that represents
[SPEAKER_03]: a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we demonstrated through a series of
empirical studies that an 80% protein
[SPEAKER_03]: identity level in the NB arc domain in
particular is the correct definition of
[SPEAKER_03]: this diversity bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to talk about why we ended
up with that number.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this diversity bin, as we think of it,
in my mind is akin to a species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all understand that species is
number one in artificial construct.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that a species is a biologically
meaningful entity that represents a series
[SPEAKER_03]: of genotypes that are genetically diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the same way, this composite group,
this diversity bin, represents a set of R
[SPEAKER_03]: genes that are genetically diverse,
but still has biological meaning,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you'll see in a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've also created a standardized
terminology to go along with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rather than calling these composite
groups, we refer to these as ROSR80
[SPEAKER_03]: groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that stands for ROSACA R genes at 80%
identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can number these sequentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a community, this becomes a resource
for dialogue about the evolution of these
[SPEAKER_03]: genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ROSR80 groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the ROSACA, we've got 12 different
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our computer pipeline identified a total
of about 2,500 R genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the key things that we're doing in
this study is applying a common set of
[SPEAKER_03]: rules across all 12 species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the numbers that we identify in a
particular species sometimes varies from
[SPEAKER_03]: what's published in the literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because our definition,
our stringent rules, are a little
[SPEAKER_03]: different than what we see different
communities applying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we call an R gene in apple really
corresponds to exactly the same definition
[SPEAKER_03]: in peach or strawberry in this particular
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these 2,500 R genes could be collapsed
into 651 ROSR80 groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is still a large number, but it's
small enough that we can start to
[SPEAKER_03]: visualize data in new ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of this really is about data
visualization and observing these
[SPEAKER_03]: evolutionary pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that we've done in
this study is to create phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a maximum likelihood tree
generated by our pipeline from these 651
[SPEAKER_03]: ROSR80 groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each of the branch tips here are these
diversity bins that represent multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: different DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this tree can be annotated with all
kinds of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, I'm layering on information about
the representation of individual sequences
[SPEAKER_03]: across the various genomes in the ROSACA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I could show this as the 12 different
species with 12 concentric circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets really, really complicated very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead, I've opted here to show this
at a tribe level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are four tribes represented here
in the ROSACA, the Rubiae, the Botentile,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Amygdalae, and the Pyrieae.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rubiae, in this case, is a single
genome sequence of Rubus, so black
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Botentile includes strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got six different Fragaria
species in this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amygdalae are two different prunus
species, and the Pyrieae are apple and
[SPEAKER_03]: pear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this visualization allows us to see
certain trends that the genes are
[SPEAKER_03]: represented differentially across these
various genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also, at a topographical level,
we've defined nine different clades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reflected in this outer ring, also shown
by the color of the tree itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are labeled the clade A through
clade I.
[SPEAKER_03]: And importantly, we can demonstrate that
this tree, that the topology of this tree
[SPEAKER_03]: points to these two broad, evolutionarily
distinct lineages of NBLR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mentioned the TIR and non-TIR type.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in fact, we see that same
evolutionarily pattern reflected in the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure of this tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that serves almost as an internal
control, telling us that the pattern that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're seeing in this approach has
biological relevancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of time went into this simple
diagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that we've got this, we can start
to make certain evolutionary observations
[SPEAKER_03]: about the patterns of diversification of
these R genes across the various species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to list four evolutionary
observations coming out of this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is that R gene lineages are
predominantly of ancient origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this tells us is that this
magical plant that lived 100 million years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago that gave rise to everything we call
Roseaceae today already had the remnants
[SPEAKER_03]: of those nine R gene clades back 100
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as that plant diverged into
distinct species, the plant physiology
[SPEAKER_03]: changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The geographic representation of the
plants changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pathogens that it encountered
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see adaptation of the R genes
throughout speciation events.
[SPEAKER_03]: But almost all of the R genes that we see
today can trace their lineage to a common
[SPEAKER_03]: ancestor that lived 100 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, we see from our analyses that
everything is everywhere except when it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that, I mean that the nine clades
are predominantly, the nine R gene clades
[SPEAKER_03]: are predominantly represented across the
12 genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to highlight the exceptions because
I think those are really the interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show this a couple different
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to represent this data,
but I'll do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show it in a couple different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this complicated figure is best read
from right to left.
[SPEAKER_03]: The right column here represents the 651
rosary lineages that we've created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've broken these into the TIR and
the non-TIR types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, we've mapped the representation of
those lineages back onto the individual
[SPEAKER_03]: clades, so those A through I that we've
defined.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we've mapped the presence of the
clades onto the 12 genomes that are
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzed in this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you have really good eyes and you
really stare at this a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are a couple of things that will
jump out at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, clade F right here,
really, really tiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, there's a single rosary
sequence that represents clade F in this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clade F is only found in apple and pear,
so the palm fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absent in the prunus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absent in strawberries and in
raspberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that tells us that that particular
clade is probably of recent origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of these are really ancient 100
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one had to have evolved some time in
the last 32 million years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you study this for a long time,
you'll see that clade A, well represented
[SPEAKER_03]: across the rosaceae, but missing in the
two prunus species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hypothesized that this might have
been lost sometime within the last 39
[SPEAKER_03]: million years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I can show this in a different way on
this tree you've already seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clade F is this thin blue line right here,
present only in apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: In pear and missing in the other species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And clade A is missing in the two prunus
genomes that we've studied.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that must have been a recent loss,
at least no more than 52 million years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these are really hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our data set, while we've got 12 genomes,
it's ultimately limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're both technical and biological
reasons that we might see this pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this really warrants more analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be analyzing more genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are really interesting patterns
that we can only see through comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another exception to the everything
is everywhere rule comes from phragaria
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were fortunate to have access to six
different genome sequences of phragaria
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the six species here are shown as
columns in this table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nine argin clades that we've
defined are rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are a couple types of data that
are represented here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The size of the circle indicates the
relative number of individual DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: sequences per clade per species.
[SPEAKER_03]: A related measure is the color,
which is the number of rows or 80 groups
[SPEAKER_03]: per clade per species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, the thing you need to know to
understand this is if you see a circle,
[SPEAKER_03]: that means there's an argin from that
clade in that particular plant genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bigger the circle, the darker red
the circle, the more individual sequences
[SPEAKER_03]: are present.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump out immediately, clade F.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that tiny little clade that we see
only in apple and pear, completely missing
[SPEAKER_03]: in our phragaria species.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this species is phragaria vesca.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the very first sequence for
phragaria species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And phragaria vesca has really been touted
as a model system for analyses in the Rose
[SPEAKER_03]: ACA for many different applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really sort of disturbing to me
that we found no evidence of clade A,
[SPEAKER_03]: D, or F, E in this particular plant
genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, there could be technical reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be biological reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if we sequence a different genotype
of phragaria vesca, those sequences would
[SPEAKER_03]: be present.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this is sort of a wake-up
call, I guess, for overuse of model
[SPEAKER_03]: systems in sending plant genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we really need are lots of plant
genome sequences from lots of different
[SPEAKER_03]: individual genotype within each species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a third evolutionary observation from
the study is that patterns of R gene
[SPEAKER_03]: homology reflect species phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll explain what this means in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this really is justification for a
comparative approach for R genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we remember that in this study,
we've collapsed the phylogenetically
[SPEAKER_03]: redundant diversity in these R gene
clusters into a single composite sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Importantly, these sequences, while
defined at an 8% identity level for DMV
[SPEAKER_03]: protein, we have not constrained species
representation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some cases, these groups comprise
sequences from only one species.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, they might contain
sequences from multiple different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to clarify that I'm talking
about the representation within individual
[SPEAKER_03]: ROSR-80 groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a broad clade could be represented
across the ROSR-80 group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, and we'll talk about this
in just a moment, these sequences shown
[SPEAKER_03]: right here are found only in apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an example of a ROSR-80 group
that comprises sequences from one species,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though the clade overall is
represented across the ROSR-80.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we only look at representation within
the ROSR-80, we see that the majority of
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals in individual ROSR-80 groups
comprise sequences that come only from one
[SPEAKER_03]: tribe, the closely related species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's represented by the numbers in
these circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this makes good sense, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is consistent with this model of
rapid evolution of R genes to adapt to
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen pressures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we see ROSR-80 lineages
comprising sequences from more than one
[SPEAKER_03]: tribe, the more closely related the tribe
is, the more common shared individual
[SPEAKER_03]: sequences are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, we see the stone fruits
and the pome sharing 17 ROSR-80 groups in
[SPEAKER_03]: common, and Phrygaria species and Rubus
species sharing four.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in contrast to the more distantly
related tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more distantly related you are,
the less likely you are to share sequences
[SPEAKER_03]: in common.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what phylogeny is built on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this more or less serves as a
justification for comparative genomics
[SPEAKER_03]: approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this really works for R genes as well
as for other genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this graph also shows something that I
find just fascinating and perplexing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to hear your thoughts on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always think about R genes as evolving
very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed you the graph.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used that terminology multiple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are certain R genes that we've
found in this study that are very slow
[SPEAKER_03]: evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in particular, four ROSR-80 groups
comprise sequences from all the tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So over 100 million years, these genes,
the protein sequences, have not diverged
[SPEAKER_03]: by more than 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does not match the pattern of
responding to changing pathogen pressures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the key questions that comes to
my mind is, what are these sequences
[SPEAKER_03]: doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few models that we've gotten
in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be involved in non-host
resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they're so good at what they do,
they've been conserved in the ROSA-CA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're defending a would-be pathogen
that we don't even think of as a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be engaged in mediating
positive plant microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe they have entirely different
functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be involved, for example,
in environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some key experiments we can
think of, look at their transcription
[SPEAKER_03]: patterns, upregulate them, knock them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, what do you challenge these
plants with?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you knock one of these genes out,
what do you challenge with?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd love to hear your thoughts on
exactly how we can tackle what these
[SPEAKER_03]: things are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this really, I think, illustrates the
power of comparative genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were looking at the genome sequence
of apple, certainly those gene sequences
[SPEAKER_03]: are present there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have no idea that they're highly
conserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So through this comparative approach,
we begin to see that understanding these
[SPEAKER_03]: patterns of diversification actually can
tie back to putative biological function.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what we want to leverage in
the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the fourth and final evolutionary
observation I want to share with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, is the most exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that species differ in
patterns of our gene diversification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this really provides clue to how to
use this to mine those gene bank
[SPEAKER_03]: collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've seen this tree before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already pointed out that clade E is
well represented across all of the species
[SPEAKER_03]: in this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: But within the clade, there are certain
subclades that show very different
[SPEAKER_03]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this subclade that I'm highlighting is
a good example of diversification that's
[SPEAKER_03]: happened only in the palm fruits,
only in apple or in pear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very, very well represented in apple
and pear.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this subclade is absent in these other
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, this means something.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an evolutionary reason why this
has happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would predict that that has some
biological function that's important to
[SPEAKER_03]: apple and pear, but irrelevant to the
other plant species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's another layer of data that I
want to layer on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk in more detail about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This outer circle that you see here is a
heat map that shows the composition of the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual rosary group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember, the rosary groups are the
branch tips here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this actually shows you how many
individual DNA sequences went into
[SPEAKER_03]: defining that R gene, that the rosary
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark color indicates two sequences,
which is the minimum definition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this study, the largest rosary
group has more than 60 sequences,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's shown as white.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within this subclade, for example,
we see a multitude of colors, orange being
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of in the 20 to 40 individual DNA
sequences going into that group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look across the tree,
you see many examples of this sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: pattern of evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So apple and pear really prefer this
clade, telling us that there's something
[SPEAKER_03]: happening in a functional evolutionary
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast, strawberry loves this
particular clade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding what these patterns are,
I think, is really key to linking DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence to putative function,
and then ultimately mining these for the
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement of crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the four evolutionary observations,
just to conclude this piece, R gene
[SPEAKER_03]: lineages are of ancient origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is everywhere except when it's
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patterns of R gene homology reflect
species biology, and species differ in
[SPEAKER_03]: patterns of R gene diversification.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was all sort of observational
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next phase, I want to tell you
about a couple hypotheses that are
[SPEAKER_03]: emerging from here that really only
happened because we're looking across
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the areas I've really been
interested in for a long time is an answer
[SPEAKER_03]: to this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has agriculture escalated the molecular
arms race between plants and pathogens?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really an elegant literature out
there that documents that large-scale
[SPEAKER_03]: monocultures practiced in modern
agriculture has had significant impact on
[SPEAKER_03]: the effector suites of pathogen
populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen that in multiple different
pathosystems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's perfectly logical that we
would see the same pattern in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd look a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in plants, what we think is happening
is that pathogen pressures are driving
[SPEAKER_03]: plant genomes to diversify specific
alleles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we talked about in terms of
clustering of these genes, one of the key
[SPEAKER_03]: drivers for allelic diversification is
expansion of R gene clusters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thinking about evolutionary patterns
where individual species have lots of R
[SPEAKER_03]: genes and high allelic diversity in
certain clades or subclades on our tree,
[SPEAKER_03]: we think is an evolutionary indicator that
pathogen pressures are causing the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: to diversify in those genomic regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to test this, we've turned to the
apple scab pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now apple scab is aptly named.
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes scab in apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's caused by the fungus venturia in a
qualus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has for a very long time been a
target of apple breeding efforts in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there have been a total of 20 R genes
or resistance genes defined at a
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypic level in the apple scab
pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are labeled RVI1 through RVI20.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think two of these have been cloned.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in fact NBLRR genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of them have been mapped to
varying degrees and are useful for
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't actually know what the
underlying gene is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this study, we called the literature
and put the associated molecular markers
[SPEAKER_03]: back onto the apple reference genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could find likely NBLRR candidates
for 15 of these genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we looked at those 15 genes,
we hypothesized the apple scab genes
[SPEAKER_03]: should occupy these large,
species-specific, highly-diversified
[SPEAKER_03]: rosar-80 clades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, I'm showing it only for three
of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: RVI4, 15, and 1, the candidates for those
genes reside in that highly-diversified
[SPEAKER_03]: subclade and clade E that I described.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, each of these comes from a
rosar-80 group that contains many
[SPEAKER_03]: different DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this pattern of allelic
diversification, I think of it as really
[SPEAKER_03]: iterative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Evolution, perhaps apple hit on some gene
sequence that worked really well against
[SPEAKER_03]: venturia and equallus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then evolutionary dynamics created
more allelic diversity at that locus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of that allelic diversity works
against venturia and equallus,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this idea of reinventing functional
genes seems to be a pattern of evolution
[SPEAKER_03]: that plants are adapting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's reflected very nicely in the
overall topology of our tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm looking across our 15 candidate
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found really strong statistical support
for this idea that important agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: genes reside in these highly-diversified
clades.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gives us a clue in how we can
actually go after gene bank collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we develop strategies for generating
sequence data from gene bank collections
[SPEAKER_03]: at those loci, we suddenly have a way of
recognizing which genotypes or species or
[SPEAKER_03]: populations have novel DNA sequence or
protein level diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that information then can form
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this used as a system can really speed
up discovery of useful traits for plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this idea of mining is really where
we're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the first step towards that,
we're pursuing actually in the Rose Black
[SPEAKER_03]: Spot pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Stan Hockenstein is a professor at
University of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: David Zlizak is at the University of
Wisconsin River Falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've collaborated with these two guys for
probably 10 years on Rose Black Spot
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan's actually a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's part of the USDA CAP called Rose
Breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the focus of that is to develop
molecular markers linked to useful disease
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance traits like Black Spot and
Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in connection with that project,
we've already generated large segregating
[SPEAKER_03]: populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've done a lot of phenotyping data
and SNP marker analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to leverage that data set and our
ROSR-80 system to identify perfect markers
[SPEAKER_03]: for marker-assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this context, I'm defining a
perfect marker as one that's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: derived from the causal gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the goal is to actually land on top of
the allele that makes ROSR resistant to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Black Spot path.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for this, we're adapting DNA sequence
cow capture approach called RENSEQ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was pioneered by Jonathan Jones's
group in, ironically, the potato late
[SPEAKER_03]: blight system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is that a series of DNA sequence
baits are created from known R gene
[SPEAKER_03]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's used then to pull down
corresponding, not necessarily identical,
[SPEAKER_03]: but corresponding sequences from DNA
solutions from, for example, gene bank
[SPEAKER_03]: collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives us a pool of R gene-enriched
DNA that can be sequenced at large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're using this in ROSE.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're creating a DNA baits from what we've
learned are the nine clades in the ROSE
[SPEAKER_03]: ACA.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already created resistance
susceptible bulk based on our ROSE
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotyping that we completed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to create sequence libraries
that have allele level resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll identify candidate polymorphisms
and, of course, validate on the larger
[SPEAKER_03]: data set.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this really serves as a proof of
concept that would be directly applicable
[SPEAKER_03]: to ROSE breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think could be really ported to
almost any plant family, almost any gene
[SPEAKER_03]: bank collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, for example, downstream,
we'd like to do this in the apple scab
[SPEAKER_03]: pathos system or in potato late blight or
in wheat rust.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has really a multitude of
applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to wrap up, in this seminar,
I presented comparative genomics framework
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're calling the ROSR80 system.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really what we've done is to
define a set of rules for looking across
[SPEAKER_03]: plant families at the evolution of these
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've created a computer pipeline that
does that in a semi-automated fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the ROSE ACA, some of our evolutionary
observations are that our gene lineages
[SPEAKER_03]: are at least a million years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is everywhere, almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our gene distribution reflects phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most important is that species
differ in patterns of our gene
[SPEAKER_03]: diversification.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is our entree into hypothesis
testing, linking individuals, our gene
[SPEAKER_03]: sequences or our protein sequences,
the putative biological function.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the end goal here is to
really effectively mine gene bank
[SPEAKER_03]: collections for crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, the genotyping will drive
informed phenotyping that will sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: fast forward our process of plant
improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, if I've got time,
I'm very happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the question was, do our genes tend to
cluster near recombination hotspots in
[SPEAKER_03]: plant genomes?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this idea of clustering is really
important in terms of driving overall
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution and adaptation, creation of new
alleles at these loci, but other factors
[SPEAKER_03]: like being in genome locations that are
more prone to recombination is another key
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're often associated with transposable
elements, which I think probably has a
[SPEAKER_03]: biological role.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are many factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably don't have a full,
complete understanding of what's driving
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but your question's spot on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking specifically about the
four?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the question referred to that
small set of our genes that really have
[SPEAKER_03]: not evolved very rapidly over 100 million
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question was, are these our genes,
are the cognate effectors highly conserved
[SPEAKER_03]: in pathogen populations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are guards of the highly conserved
plant protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're asking if the conserved our
genes are guards of highly conserved plant
[SPEAKER_03]: protein?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I would even go so far to say
that the cognate effector probably is
[SPEAKER_03]: highly conserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that whether that is a
non-host that's consistent with the idea
[SPEAKER_03]: that they might play a role in non-host
resistance, I think it also could be
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent with the idea that they may be
involved in mediating positive
[SPEAKER_03]: plant-microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I'm speculating at this point,
because we don't have any data about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But probably, I think that's a logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I knew the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, in that F clade,
that tiny little clade, our gene clade,
[SPEAKER_03]: that seems to only be represented in apple
and pear, what's it doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it corresponding to some unique
pathogen that's only found in apple and
[SPEAKER_03]: pear?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are many unique pathogens of
each of the species in the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a good guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know how to narrow that down.
Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any hypothesis for the
dramatic difference in numbers of our
[SPEAKER_01]: genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so Bill's asking, why do the number of
our genes in rosaceous genomes vary from
[SPEAKER_03]: 43 in rubis to more than 60?
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 in apple?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it actually means something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me give two schools of thought on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this idea out in the literature
that woody plants should have more our
[SPEAKER_03]: genes, because they're longer lived.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have traced this back to the poplar
genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be just sort of put out there
as a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it in multiple different papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see no evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't understand how a woody plant
says, oh, yeah, I need lots of our genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that's the driver.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is actually happening relates
to the agriculture intensification of
[SPEAKER_03]: these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more highly intensively farmed plants,
things that have a longer history of
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, things that are a broader
worldwide distribution, I think should
[SPEAKER_03]: have more our genes, especially compared
to the wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though we've got 12 genomes in
the study, we don't really have that many
[SPEAKER_03]: wild species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I'd like to do with our
pipeline is do sort of a meta-analysis of
[SPEAKER_03]: the 251 plant genomes that we do have and
start to look at life history of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, cultivation history, the
agricultural significance of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's woody or not woody,
and see what the correlation is with the
[SPEAKER_03]: number of our genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a biologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there has to be a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know what it is yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to speak up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this idea, the question relates to
agricultural intensification.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the driver?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that influencing the putative
change in our gene numbers?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're both intentional
selection, unintentional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in agriculture, as we know,
it's 10,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody had a great idea 10,000 years
ago to actually plant some of the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: that she went out and harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: That act alone, the domestication process,
put selection on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plants that don't shatter, plants that
overwinter, plants that taste good,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was an inherent selection that
went on during that domestication process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably people 10,000 years ago
didn't want to eat scabby apples any more
[SPEAKER_03]: than we do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they probably ate the ones that looked
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't intentional selection,
but it was selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in more modern times,
breeding, we're intentionally putting that
[SPEAKER_03]: selective pressure on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's probably a combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the key things that has come out of
our study, though, is it's really changed
[SPEAKER_03]: the way I think about evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always thought of evolution as
happening over millions of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are genes, are they even generation to
generation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we seeing changes in these clusters?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that'd be a really cool set of
experiments to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with whole genome sequencing becoming
more accessible, it's something we
[SPEAKER_03]: probably can do in the not too distant
future.
