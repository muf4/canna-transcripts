[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My title says Potato Variety, Diversity,
Attributes, and Farmers' Needs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably most of you know where Ethiopia
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopia is the former name of Abyssinia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the center of diversity of more than
16 crops, like sorghum, teff, nougat,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the center of diversity of more than
16 crops in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But potato is not endemic to Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is believed that it is originated or
introduced about 150 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this green shaded area is very suitable
for potato production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is estimated above 3 million hectares.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably Ethiopia has possibly the
highest potential of potato production in
[SPEAKER_01]: sub-Saharan Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trend also, the potato acreage
expansion, also shows that in 1970s,
[SPEAKER_01]: potato production was 30,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2014, it was 179,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is about a six-fold increment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because potato is a very good food
security crop, because it is early
[SPEAKER_01]: maturing, high yield, and it is good for
food in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the productivity of potato is
decreasing through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, it is about 10 tons per hectare
when compared with 40 tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we compare North American
productivity, Ethiopian potato
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity is about nine tons per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the productivity will be
decreased even farther because of these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drought is aggravated through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late blight, especially the main potato
diseases in Ethiopia, is devastating and
[SPEAKER_01]: aggravated through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depletion of soil fertility because of
soil erosion is aggravated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these causes, these problems also
really make potato crop decreasing even
[SPEAKER_01]: farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ethiopian Agricultural Research System
established in, especially the potato
[SPEAKER_01]: program, established in 1975.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to increase the productivity of the
crop, released 31 new potato varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: with assumption that local varieties are
low yielding and they have narrow genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with assumption that these improved
varieties are released selected for their
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and late blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the major selection criteria for
the research system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other recommendation the research
system did is shift planting seasons to
[SPEAKER_01]: rainy season, because in the dry season,
the rainfall status is not dependable for
[SPEAKER_01]: potato grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the research system recommends the dry
season production to main rain season
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have four growing seasons in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Belk, Balmer, Mahar, and Mesna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belk, Balmer, and Mesna are dry seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is the main rain season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the research system recommends instead
of planting potato in these seasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: planting potato in this season using the
main new varieties is a good strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the research system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how is the farmer's response for these
research recommendations?
[SPEAKER_01]: The new varieties have not been accepted
in most of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As expected, what is the reason behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers want to grow local varieties
rather than new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers still grow potato in the dry
season than in the new season.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the reason behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to see those problems, we proposed
about four research objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is assessment of local
varieties, their distribution,
[SPEAKER_01]: and importance in different agroecologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one, identify farmer variety
needs in different agroecologies,
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping systems, and market access.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one, determine genetic
relationship between local Ethiopian
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties with different sources in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth one is measure the relative
tolerance of Ethiopian potato variety to
[SPEAKER_01]: water stress using screen house
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to attain these objectives,
we conducted a series of objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one, the first research
activity, it is published in American
[SPEAKER_01]: Journal of Potato Research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says potato variety diversity,
determinants, and implication of potato
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding strategy in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a survey for six districts
representing different agroecologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the Ligand, this is a very
dry area, and these two are moist areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area, it uses bimodal rainfall,
and it's cool highland.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mid-altitude area, and the farmers
target produce potato for the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this district, new variety
intervention is in high status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the survey contains semi-structured
interviews, focus group discussions,
[SPEAKER_01]: field and storage observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we recorded those local varieties and
new varieties, new varieties which I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: those varieties released by the research
system so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 14 varieties are grown in
different areas of the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the major varieties differed between
districts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Shashaman, these Agadir
and Nachababa are the main two varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these varieties are widely marketed in
Addis Ababa market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the northwest, these three varieties,
Abalo, Sukwari, and Samoni are the main
[SPEAKER_01]: one, and in Goumar and Geta, these variety
are the main one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 14 number of local varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you come to the new varieties,
about six varieties are recorded and
[SPEAKER_01]: grown, but three varieties are widely
grown, Sisai and Gudan and Bellada.
[SPEAKER_01]: From 31 new varieties, only three
varieties, that is 9% of them are adopted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the aggregate area allocated to new
varieties is 23%.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the number of varieties grown
per household, most of the farmers grow
[SPEAKER_01]: potato, grow more than one varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, most of the farmers in Goumar
and Geta grow more than 40% or more than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers grow three or more varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for risk avoidance and for some
characteristics, I'll come through it
[SPEAKER_01]: within a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each local varieties have its own
specific characteristics, and in each
[SPEAKER_01]: agroecology, farmers have varieties for
different purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers have varieties for drought
tolerance, farmers have varieties for
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptation to low soil fertility,
especially in remote areas, in remote
[SPEAKER_01]: areas where chemical fertilizer is not a
main issue, a main source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers have late blight resistance
varieties, varieties with storage
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers have varieties for market and
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also recorded potato production
practices, because this is helpful to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the farmer's needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we see those farmers who apply
fertilizer, especially in two districts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Banja, they don't use it, they don't
use fertilizer at all, and Ligand,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 58%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even from those farmers who use
chemical fertilizer, most of the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: use diamonic phosphate instead of urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the research recommendation is both,
both diamonic phosphate and urea is
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended, but most of the farmers want
to use only diamonic phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the farmers do not use
phenoxide for late blight, except
[SPEAKER_01]: Shashamani and Gumare and Geta farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come to seed source, most of the
farmers use their own seed source,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in Gumare and Geta,
90% of the farmers, the farms used their
[SPEAKER_01]: own seed, especially in the highland
areas, and this market also has its own
[SPEAKER_01]: share, especially in the highland areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is quarried above 3,100 meters above
sea level, and Ligand, it's also a very
[SPEAKER_01]: cool highland.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these areas, there is no bacteria
reported so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in these areas, market share has its
own play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the second of our activities,
is evaluation of genetic diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopia and potato germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collected 44 local varieties with
supporting information, that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: traits, the farmer's traits, and for how
many years they produce these varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we collected from northwest Ethiopia
and southern Ethiopia because these two
[SPEAKER_01]: locations represent more than 70% of the
potato area in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used molecular characterization and
morphological characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA was isolated from 44 Ethiopian local
varieties and 31 CIP varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did this using CTAB protocol in
Ethiopia and clarified using coagulation
[SPEAKER_01]: in Walter lab and genotyped in 8,310
standard SNP marker using Illumina array.
[SPEAKER_01]: And SNPs from 22 American and 70 European
clones also included.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from these markers, we used this
amount of SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case of morphological characters,
we collected those 44 varieties and
[SPEAKER_01]: planted in the screen house and evaluated
for the flower characteristic,
[SPEAKER_01]: for stem and other plant characteristics,
tuber characteristics to confirm our DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, DNA result is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 44 local varieties, about 15
varieties are unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are duplicates, named duplicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, this variety is well-known in
the northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also grown in the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has six names in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is called Suquare.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Suquare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this variety is widely grown in
Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one, Abalo, is also widely
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this variety, Abadamu, it has a very
good tuber shape, but the farmers do not
[SPEAKER_01]: want to grow this variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is reported that it is drought-tolerant
variety, but it has a bitter taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the main problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Nachaba variety is widely seen in
Addis Ababa market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also grouped Ethiopian varieties in
relation to European, American,
[SPEAKER_01]: and SIP varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is SIP varieties group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three groups based on the cluster
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the SIP group.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is American group, the black.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is European group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopian varieties are found in two
groups, in SIP groups and European group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the oldest varieties,
like Abalo, Samune, Natbagoro,
[SPEAKER_01]: Drame, these are in the European groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latest in local varieties is in the
SIP group.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense because 35 years ago,
Ethiopia introduced potato varieties from
[SPEAKER_01]: European countries, not from SIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, most of Ethiopian research
system introduced potato varieties from
[SPEAKER_01]: SIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably these varieties may be
derived from SIP sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: The principal component analysis also
showed the same trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ethiopian varieties are located in the
SIP and European sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the American sources are widely
distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the heterozygosity also showed
American sources are highly heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_01]: followed by European.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ethiopian sources are better than SIP
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we see the FST test, Ethiopian
sources are closely related to SIP and
[SPEAKER_01]: European than American.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the third activity, it says genotopic
variation in potato growth and yield
[SPEAKER_01]: response to water stress during cool and
warm season production of the West
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you we have four seasons and we
want to taste especially those highly
[SPEAKER_01]: drought-affected seasons, Belk and Mesna.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to taste different varieties in
these seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we arranged our ports.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a port experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We arranged the ports in four
replications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each treatment has two ports.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a regated one in the green,
and the red port are the stressed one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used water markers and tensiometers
installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tensiometers are not functioning well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used water markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water markers can monitor the moisture
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moisture level greater than minus 0.03
megapascal will be regated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less than this one will be stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ports, the plant is regated
uniformly until 40 days and then stressed
[SPEAKER_01]: again for 41 days, like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the result shows that this is,
sequaria is a widely grown variety,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can use this variety as a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a German variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is reported to have good drought
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no variety out yielded this local,
this local check.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in warmer season, this variety is
really, it has a very good potential when
[SPEAKER_01]: compared with this one, 11 gram per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this variety gave 209 gram per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very good drought tolerance ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see the water stress
susceptibility index in the Mesno cool
[SPEAKER_01]: season, some varieties, a new variety,
a local variety, it is reported to have
[SPEAKER_01]: good drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Abaddamu, I told you previously,
these have a very good low susceptibility
[SPEAKER_01]: index.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Belgrade season, this variety,
new variety, and this German variety has
[SPEAKER_01]: very good tolerance to drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lower the number, the better,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the lower the number, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the granule and the pictures,
in the stress treatment, some tubers have
[SPEAKER_01]: a good marketable size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this variety, not Bogoro, it is very
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it reaches 1.5 SSI value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cannot find marketable tubers size.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the percent unmarketable,
small size tubers, comparing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Czech, Suquare, this variety, Abaddamu,
a local variety, this granula,
[SPEAKER_01]: this sieve advanced clore because we
included this variety because it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: good tolerance to drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gera, a new variety released for
droughts, stricken areas, has a very good
[SPEAKER_01]: high number of, low number of small tubers
in both Mesno and Belk.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see the AMI analysis, it is the
same trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: This granula, Abaddamu, they fit well to
the warm season condition to Belk season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this regime China, Suquare,
is good for Mesno or cool season.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the correlation matrix,
[SPEAKER_01]: those trades in relation to yield,
marketable tubers yield in total,
[SPEAKER_01]: total tuber yield, those stem weight above
ground biomass and leaf area ratio have
[SPEAKER_01]: negative relationship with yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But harvest index has a positive
relationship with marketable and total
[SPEAKER_01]: tuber yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my last presentation, my last
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identification of farmer priorities in
potato products through participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: variety selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is accepted for publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used PVS approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PVS approach uses first situation
analysis, search for varieties and
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is related to experimentation
because we did situation analysis in our
[SPEAKER_01]: survey and we did search for varieties in
our second experiment that is genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this study is intended to find out
really the local varieties are low
[SPEAKER_01]: yielding, we need to test that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to test that why the farmers
do not want to grow in the dry season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the research recommendation in the wet
season, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to check that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to find out what are the
farmers' variety needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used two districts in the highlands
with different agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is dry and the other wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used diverse set of varieties from
local and from new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we organized farmer's research groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: We organized farmer's research groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each group has 39 members.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each group has its own chair and
secretary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they evaluated the varieties in the
flowering stage, in the harvesting stage
[SPEAKER_01]: and after three months after storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Ligand area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Yilmana area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grouped based on gender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably we wanted to see the gender
issues here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we recorded those 23 varieties to
collect these 23 traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: First we asked farmers which are the best
five varieties and what is the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also asked them what are the bad
performing varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the reason behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these traits are recorded from
those reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we record those reasons and the
farmers evaluate those traits again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have male ratings here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have female ratings in each location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from here, high yield, long shelf life,
because long shelf life varieties are very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very determining traits for
variety acceptance in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research system didn't want to see
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They simply see the yield and a little
blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the farmers really consider this is a
very important trait and suitable for
[SPEAKER_01]: sequential harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmers want to use, want to harvest
two times at least in one growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drought tolerance, low soil fertility
adaptation, especially in Ligand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males are very, they have a very good
concern in soil fertility adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late blight resistance, suitability to
boiling, suitability to stew, that is for
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the main traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also another trait, market demand,
especially in Yilmana, tolerance to wind
[SPEAKER_01]: and hail damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thick stems, these are very, very
important traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tested in the field, we tested the
yield of local varieties and new
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, Ethiopian local varieties
are lower yield than the new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late blight is about 24%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 ton per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in the new varieties,
we cannot get 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the new varieties are not low yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case of seasons, because we tested
two seasons, the dry season, that is
[SPEAKER_01]: Belmer, and the main rain season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those late maturing varieties fit well
to the Belmer season, because these
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties needs long maturation time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belmer season is a long maturing period.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short, early maturing varieties are
fit well to the Mher season, the main rain
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is impossible to recommend those
late maturing varieties to grow in the
[SPEAKER_01]: main rain season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our conclusion, in case of potato
genetic resource assessment, we recorded
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopian major varieties, probably this
may be the first report, their
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution merits in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number of varieties grown per household
and reasons documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic variation among Ethiopian
varieties and outside clones are
[SPEAKER_01]: documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our study also negates the belief that
Ethiopian varieties have narrow genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethiopian varieties does not have a
narrow genetic base, based on our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield response of selected local
varieties under water stress is
[SPEAKER_01]: documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: This finding also negates the belief that
Ethiopian local varieties are low
[SPEAKER_01]: yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not low yielding, probably
because we started with this tester seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably those seeds probably infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be the reason for low yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our study, Ethiopian local
varieties, some of the varieties at least,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're good, good as new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case of production systems,
four seasons recorded, we named one
[SPEAKER_01]: season, because there was a confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it Belmer season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Belmer season, some people say it is
Mher, some people say it is called Belk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is in betune.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call it Belmer season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Differences in growing season between
potato growing sub regions were
[SPEAKER_01]: documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Major potato production challenges and
their importance are recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case of farmers variety needs,
we give answers why new varieties are not
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted as expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have answers about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers cited 23 traits are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Key variety traits differ among
agroecological zones, cropping systems and
[SPEAKER_01]: market utilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Northwest needs another
variety, especially Northwest needs long
[SPEAKER_01]: storable varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: South farmers need quick dormancy
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a difference in demand of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have recommendations, these
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is good to register the main Ethiopian
local varieties and prepare an Ethiopian
[SPEAKER_01]: potato catalog with some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilize the available major varieties for
future breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiply this stator starter seed of major
farmer varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incorporate additional quality and stress
tolerance traits during variety
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And address the variation in agroecology,
cropping systems, market access during
[SPEAKER_01]: variety development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have international programs through
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because without this program, I would not
be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank international programs,
Borlaug Leap U.S.I.D., Richard Bradfield
[SPEAKER_01]: Award, Chris Plurian Church, Inaudi
Center, International Potato Center,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopian Biotechnology Research
Institute, and these personnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you really, thank you so much
indeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: One question that I hadn't thought of
before, which was you found that only a
[SPEAKER_04]: small number of the varieties you looked
at were genetically distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 14 out of how many?
[SPEAKER_04]: From 44, we found 15 unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you designed your water stress
experiment, you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That information came later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So were the varieties that you chose for
the water stress experiment, were they all
[SPEAKER_04]: unique varieties that were not the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my varieties in the water stress
are unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, we included some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we removed that later on, because we
conducted two experiments, water stress
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't really design them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You removed some because you found out
that they were similar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I remember we included two
varieties, that is leca and archimene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the molecular characterization,
these varieties are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we removed one, like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you continue to go along with future
breeding programs, what kind of traits
[SPEAKER_03]: will you primarily focus on, or what will
be your first traits that you decide to
[SPEAKER_03]: focus on?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the Ethiopian research system,
because I am part of it, and we usually
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on yield and lead supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand now, right now,
these two are not only, the two traits are
[SPEAKER_01]: not only these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storage is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the farmers want to store for
several months for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, Avaro variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avaro is very known variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmers love it, because it is,
it can stay two years in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very unique variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So storage is the main one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storage trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other traits like drought
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is based on the agroecology conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Market also, it's own value.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when you go in Shashaman,
in the southern Ethiopia, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce red skinned variety,
no one uses that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to grow red skinned variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is depending on the market
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market in Aki Sababa uses white
skinned varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the farmers do not accept those red
skinned varieties like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So markets also, it's own share,
storage, environment, drought,
[SPEAKER_01]: and dead plight is also the major one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of your results do you think will
surprise the Ethiopian research community
[SPEAKER_00]: the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is genetic, the genetic
diversity analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in so many reports I have seen
that, for example, Sequary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sequary reported six types.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are assumed as new varieties,
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the 44 local varieties are
considered as identical varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our results show that most of them are
good case.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good, very good result,
I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is that local
varieties are not low yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our results show that local varieties are
not low yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even Ethiopian local varieties have
some diversity within the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really the two important
messages that are very important for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethiopian research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you add more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now I have a follow up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you began your research, did you
think that local varieties were low
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you think there were so many
different local varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of duplication of local
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you began your research, having been
an Ethiopian potato researcher for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, were you expecting this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this a surprise to you too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even those high yielding varieties or
local high yielding varieties are very
[SPEAKER_01]: few, but they have good attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you cannot get these attributes or
these traits from new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the traits we get from Avalu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still we cannot get, or we could not get
these traits from new varieties or from
[SPEAKER_01]: American varieties, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also some varieties in the
eastern part of Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so, especially for drought
tolerance, there may be some important
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't test them because I have no
time to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the near future, I'm going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to collect those local
varieties in the eastern Ethiopia,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the Hararpi areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even we have some local varieties in
the central Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some varieties are not included in the
genetic analysis because we didn't test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found them after DNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe some very important local
varieties are very good for closing
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose, but they are very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can be a starting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great to see that you included
women farmers in your study.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if you could help me understand
how much decision power they have in
[SPEAKER_02]: determining what varieties actually get
planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in one location, the farmers
told me that the females are responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for selecting tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they're very good in identifying
varieties, variety traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, in a trait, sequential
harvesting trait, this is a very important
[SPEAKER_01]: trait for women than men.
[SPEAKER_01]: The women rated this trait higher than the
men.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have concern for the food,
for the supply in the Laga area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a power to accept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can live, but we cannot totally
say females can decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in some farmers, and some women
farmers have also independent husbands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can decide which variety they can
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you explain what you mean by
sequential farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sequential harvesting, for example,
in one room season, the women goes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, especially in the Belmar season.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the August season,
[SPEAKER_01]: during around maturation, but not fully
matured.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to the field and harvest some
tubers and cover the soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do not disturb the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took some bigger tubers and cover the
soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after two weeks, they go back again
and harvest some tubers, big tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, that is sequential harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good trait for women
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is a good means for food
security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in August, you cannot find any
crop harvested at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why potato is a very, very good
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it maturates in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: July, August is a very serious month for
food security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these hungry months is called hungry
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: These three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potato is only crop harvested during
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we say potato is a good crop
for food security.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can be done about virus in the seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when we visited, we saw fields
where yield had to be kept at 75% because
[SPEAKER_05]: of all the disease in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I included our varieties to our
research activities, we tested the
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties for diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: For six viruses and one bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more than 80% of our collection is
infected by viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, for one variety,
agaza, we found from 10 tubers,
[SPEAKER_01]: only one tuber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we collected from different
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only one tuber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found only one tuber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we multiply the screen out in vitro and
the screen out to get adequate amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really very, very challenging
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, there's a study, even if we use
clean seeds, we can increase Ethiopian
[SPEAKER_01]: potato program by 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of Ethiopian farms are infected by
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to do more about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the government trying to start up a
seed multiplication problem that helps
[SPEAKER_05]: reduce the virus mode or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some seed production schemes,
especially from these lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they usually concentrate on new
varieties, not local varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have two tissue culture facilities
in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is in Boleta, it's about 27 kilometers
from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is in Baharga.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're working to multiply probably
more than 40,000 tubers per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they focus on new varieties,
not local varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after my work, International Potato
Center, the people from International
[SPEAKER_01]: Potato Center took some tubers,
many tubers from my collection to multiply
[SPEAKER_01]: in larger bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably that may be very helpful for the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our capacity is very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why farmers use only their own
seeds every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 20 years or 30 years,
they usually use their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the causes for poor
productivity of the crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions for Saman?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much, Saman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Saman gets on the airplane at 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
