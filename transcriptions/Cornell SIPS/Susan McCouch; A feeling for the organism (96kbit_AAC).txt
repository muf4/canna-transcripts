[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to actually,
I'm going to tell you a story about rice
[SPEAKER_00]: and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an appropriate story to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rice is a perennial semi-aquatic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers 10% of Earth's arable land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most rice is grown on farms that are
less than a hectare in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 82% of the rice on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 90% is consumed within the
country where it's produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those statistics should tell you quite
a bit already about what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: situate you for, which is if most rice is
grown and consumed locally and not traded
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally, that leads to much
greater diversity in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice production in terms of countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three largest countries in the world
account for over 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of rice produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's China, India, and Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at this little map
showing where across the globe we have
[SPEAKER_00]: rice production, I hope that little red
spot comes forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real reason why China and India
outproduced other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because of the land mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because those red areas signify that
they get three seasons per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three crops on the same land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice if you look across,
the blue is showing you the areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce two crops per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green is areas that produce only
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Asia, which is where the majority
of rice is grown, what you see is also
[SPEAKER_00]: that within those countries that are
producing the majority of the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: rice, there are a vast number of different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, thousands of varieties are
produced every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, as I said, they're produced
and consumed locally, every locale in much
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rice growing world has its own
favorite rices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really trade their rices
widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go from village to village,
you will be treated to rices and cuisines
[SPEAKER_00]: that have evolved with those rices that
are unique to that village.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to preferences that have to
do with quality as well as to the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: or the edaphic constraints of the region
where they're grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's interesting to note that the
relationship between production and export
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite unequal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you see here are that there's
only 10% of rice that's exported from any
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very inelastic supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always more demand for importation
of rice than there is rice in the export
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see that there are two countries
that predominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's India and Thailand, and Vietnam
being a close third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is because there are really
only two types of rice that are exported
[SPEAKER_00]: in any large quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you sitting here will know which
those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the two, what we call,
supreme quality rices on the international
[SPEAKER_00]: market, basmati and Thai jasmine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two rices alone account for over
80% of rice that's exported because people
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking to pay for high quality rice
on the export market, even as countries
[SPEAKER_00]: like India are importing lower quality
rice to feed their people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very interesting kind of market
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unlike that of the other major
cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat or maize, for instance, are normally
very big commodities in the international
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not prized so much for their
local attributes in terms of cuisine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other thing about rice that I
think is very interesting is that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: these different ecotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the genetic diversity of rice
is partitioned partly because it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding species and partly because
their adaptations and whole germ pools,
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pools, that are adapted to these
different rice ecotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about rice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've divided them into the dry and the
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the dry side, we have the upland
rice, which accounts for only about 9% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the land that's used to produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rain-fed lowland rice, which we call
dry rice because it's completely dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: on rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it's too wet, but often it's
too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are the wet rices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see from this topography or
topographical map that when you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the wet rices, these are rices that this
is that semi-aquatic nature coming
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the irrigated paddy rice,
which accounts for about 50% of the land
[SPEAKER_00]: planted to rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the flooded day crew,
which is an idea that rice is planted on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shores of rivers and the rivers flood
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's often planted on the shores
of the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are saline type rices as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mangrove swamps and areas that flood
periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the deep water rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published a paper about a month or
two ago in Science about the mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: deep water rice, where rices can rise
very, very rapidly to keep up with floods
[SPEAKER_00]: that come and stay for months at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the interesting thing about the talk
I'm going to give today is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk at all about the deep water rice,
which has grown on only 5% of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk more about the problems
that we're facing as a community as we
[SPEAKER_00]: think about maintaining rice production
into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So irrigated paddy accounts for production
on about 50% of the acreage that's planted
[SPEAKER_00]: to rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it accounts for 75% of the rice that's
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very, very productive ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires that you have control of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept of irrigation is not just
that it's standing water, but you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: water on and take water off at will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now normally, you do not plant into
standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant into very low paddy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you bring the water up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, before you harvest
rice, you have to be able to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: water off and dry it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the future, part of the future's
discussions that are going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: international community is about the
concept of what we call alternate wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: and drying, where you really need control
over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring it in and take it off,
and you can actually pull the water off
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stimulates a lot of root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stimulates, in some cases,
better productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you want to bring it in during
grain filling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so the irrigated paddy is the most
productive ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rain-fed lowland rice accounts for
only 19% of production, but is planted on
[SPEAKER_00]: about 36% of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the ratio is quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rain-fed lowland rice is actually
a major ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major ecosystem in many countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the poorest farmers end up
planting on either rain-fed lowland or the
[SPEAKER_00]: upland and the deep water environments,
where they have no control over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So control over water in the rice
production system means that you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to manage your, the management
is usually more sophisticated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not dependent on rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have to introduce you to at least
a couple of these ecosystems so I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: on and explain further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people look at the paddy system and
they think, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't produce any rice in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough water on the planet
to continue to produce rice in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to walk back a little bit
and explain something that you may already
[SPEAKER_00]: know and some of you may not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the paddy system has evolved partly to
take advantage of wet land so there's land
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world, of course,
but a lot of the land in Asia actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the edges of rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of major rivers that flood
every year and the only crops that can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive in those flooded areas,
the only major cereal crop that can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive is rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other real explanation for why
people flood and want to continue flooding
[SPEAKER_00]: the land is because it's the oldest form
of weed control that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a crop that can grow in
standing water, and as I've said,
[SPEAKER_00]: rice is the only major cereal that can do
that, then when you bring water up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level, you do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drown out most of the weed species,
if they're not related, closely related to
[SPEAKER_00]: rice or if they're not an aquatic weed,
and you provide standing water,
[SPEAKER_00]: stagnant water, when it goes anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll push the pH to pH seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that optimizes the availability of
nutrients in the rice paddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having flooded rice, standing water,
an anaerobic situation, you give rice an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage over weeds, you give it almost
the perfect nutrient supply, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using land that could not be used for
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of the history in a
package of why we produce or why the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has moved towards this kind of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to mention that the reason
rice can do this is because it's capable
[SPEAKER_00]: of taking oxygen down from the chute down
to the root through the arachnid cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to have a chute above the water
line in order to be able to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has to access oxygen from the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it oxygenates its own roots by this
system of passing oxygen through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the other really big problems
with the rice paddy today, although it's
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal for growing rice, is that among
the microbial populations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and in the paddy as a whole,
in these anaerobic soils, are the
[SPEAKER_00]: methanogens that are pumping out methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that puts a lot of pressure on the
rice community too, along with the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh water to move out of the irrigated
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want you to understand that when
we think about moving out of the paddy
[SPEAKER_00]: system, we're going to have to deal with
things like weeds and nutrient disorders
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rice community has not had to
deal with as it's bred rices for these
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigated systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think about the other extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have control over water and you can
irrigate, you're very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other extreme is that you live in
these upland areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the absolute poorest part of the
rice-producing community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slash and burn field in Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's very poor soils throughout
this part of Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you slash and burn, you only get
about two or three years of production
[SPEAKER_00]: before you die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have to move out and leave the land
fallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the origin of upland rice is quite
interesting because these rices have
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved in these environments for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have learned to make
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually traditional varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not professionally bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of manual weeding and a
lot of anxiety about drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I show you this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Laotian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Laotian community in the slash
and burn hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other parts of the world
that grow upland rice in a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture shows you the Cerrados of
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they cleared parts of the Amazon,
they started planting rice in the Cerrado
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, which are upland in the sense that
they're very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they plant rice with a, usually they
plant it the way we do in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, completely mechanized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is they've slashed and they burned
the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go in and early on, before they
started planting pastures, they planted
[SPEAKER_00]: rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they planted upland rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they planted it with machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they left it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let the weeds compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't worry anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came back in at the end of the
season and harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started breeding their varieties
for this very extreme upland ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those varieties today are very,
very endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And demand, especially through parts of
West Africa, where rice consumption is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only other ecosystem I'm going to
talk about is the Rainford Lowland
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one has benefits and some very
severe challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see in the top left is the
droughted area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Rainford Lowland field where it
hasn't rained for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gentleman is actually replanting,
trying to fill in areas where his rice is
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning due to the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see people going in and
trying to replant seedlings in these
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, hoping that the rains are going to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lower right, you see the flash
floods, which is the opposite problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is constantly a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a growing problem with climate
variability, where you have both drought
[SPEAKER_00]: and submergence in the same season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally, people had a rainy
season and a dry season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they planted very different rice
during the rainy and the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're getting rain during the
dry season and drought during the wet
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having to breed for things that
can withstand both drought and flooding in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same season.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the opposite poles, you see problem
soils that are in parts in the one is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the top right is in Colombia, the lower
left is in Liberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these problems are very similar,
where you have iron toxicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: unavailability of phosphorus, and things
that go along with acid soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the breeding in those areas is
actually also a very interesting endeavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and one in which I've been very involved
and continue to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one on the lower left is a picture of
the iron toxic fields in Liberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a few varieties in the
front rows that are actually doing quite
[SPEAKER_00]: well in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been a long history of people
looking for tolerance to iron toxic soils
[SPEAKER_00]: in the glabariba, which is the rice that
was domesticated in that part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, just to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
the geography of these ecosystems and then
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you something about the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the geographical distribution of these
ecosystems, if you just look at that map,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a bunch of blue dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the irrigated fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're concentrated throughout the
high producing areas of China,
[SPEAKER_00]: India, and Indonesia, those three large
producers in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see some blue dots a little bit
down in Uruguay, in South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Madagascar, in a couple of Mali.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few areas in Senegal where they
irrigate, and then in the United States in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mississippi Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see throughout most of Africa
and parts of South America are blue and
[SPEAKER_00]: red dots, indicating the rain fed lowland
and the rain fed and the upland,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is of course rain fed in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parts of the world that are
producing rice outside of the irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: system, those are the parts of the world
where rice consumption is growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, as you see, they don't have
controlled irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeding for rain fed lowland and all
of the incumbent problems that come along
[SPEAKER_00]: with it is actually servicing a great part
of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice that within,
in Asia, you see Southeast Asia and vast
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of India and Nepal where you have
rain fed and upland systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the parts of the world where
the breeding has not been very efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the Green Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Green Revolution breeding,
those semi-dwarfs that went out,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all require controlled water and
controlled fertilizer, pesticide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and usually the beginnings of mechanized
labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we align the geography of
ecosystems with the climate risk map,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course you see that they're quite
expectedly across these areas where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about rice production being
focused in these problem areas with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call non-ideal growing conditions,
meaning they're the rain fed lowland and
[SPEAKER_00]: the uplands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the areas also that are being
exposed to the highest climate risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the rice production
challenges?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked my whole life really,
it's funny to be working on rice and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about rice breeding here in
Ithaca, New York, because most people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think about it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're certainly not that familiar
with these environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, this has been my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot about what the
production challenges are in the parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world where rice is not only a source
of food, but it's also a livelihood and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rice production challenges that we
face are to accelerate the breeding of
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielding, climate resilient,
and resource-efficient varieties for these
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to reimagine how rice is managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a huge endeavor that involves
many people, some of whom are in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room, thinking a lot about agronomy and
water management, and also thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: when and where rice is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that China is already
opening up new rice production areas in
[SPEAKER_00]: the northern part of China, north of
Beijing, counting on global warming to
[SPEAKER_00]: move their rice production zone from the
south farther north as the climate warms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also in the process, and very
actively so here at Cornell, of developing
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive models to help optimize the
genotype by environment, by management,
[SPEAKER_00]: by microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's predominantly the
methane-producing microbes to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: those interactions in future rice
production environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to improve the connectivity among
breeders, farmers, millers, service
[SPEAKER_00]: providers, input vendors, policy makers,
and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of work going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, I wear another hat,
which is the director of the Digital Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work going on in digital
ag, especially in India and China,
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to leapfrog over some of the
problems that they're encountering with
[SPEAKER_00]: the traditional forms of extension and
outreach, to use digital technologies more
[SPEAKER_00]: wisely to try to help make these
transitions that are going to be needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed their people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I did want to say, so I have these
themes of genetic development and
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity, resilience, and resource use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I'm going to give you some
examples that are going to interweave some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these ideas as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those three themes will be coming back
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was Jim who said,
when I graduated from Cornell with my PhD,
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved with my family and my two little
kids to the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a rice breeder, this is the
most beautiful thing you can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: is look outside of your lab and see all
the rice paddies right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine all the experiments that
you might want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are those electrophoresis units.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was RFLP days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Southern analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our RFLP map consisted of 135 RFLPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had taken us two years with three
people working 24-7 in order to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: that map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to kind of think back to what
the early technology was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Jim said, I did a lot of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during those early years, we not only
trained at IRI, but I actually went out to
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the national programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early 90s, China was in a very,
very, very different place than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: today and trained many of the people who
are today ministers of agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing wonderful things for their country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was back in those days when I don't
think any of us could have possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: imagined what that country would do in
terms of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my time at IRI was also punctuated by
my love of the GeneBank and all that it
[SPEAKER_00]: represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a picture of a brick and
mortar building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GeneBank actually isn't in that
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beneath that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GeneBank sits in an earthquake-proof
vault underneath that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my lab was in that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I had to do was go downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 180,000 different
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seed packs, most of them unused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know much about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they had passport information,
which is that you know where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: collected, when they were collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you knew a little bit about
some of the morphological traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you really didn't know much about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this sort of enticing
opportunity to use this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where to begin when there are 180,000
of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you would do,
of course, was think about the ecologies
[SPEAKER_00]: from which they'd been collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would tell you something about the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could think about the geography,
and that might tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also think about any comments
that had been made and registered on those
[SPEAKER_00]: seed packs when they were collected about
what farmers used these different rice
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is, and I'll come back to
this at the end, is I've been fascinated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the idea that traditional farmers had a
kind of closer communion with the land and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ecosystem and with the challenges
than most of us have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, that there was a lot
embedded in these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could just extract that
information, it would be useful to us as
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other thing is that, of course,
when I went to Erie, I had to decide what
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a nice map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all 135 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were a lot of challenges that
needed to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Rockefeller Foundation,
who was funding my position at Erie,
[SPEAKER_00]: had done a study to determine which traits
were the major constraints to rice
[SPEAKER_00]: production in the environments in which
they were interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had helped to target my work and
the work of many others at Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next part of this story is about
what traits, what discoveries,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what outcomes we have seen over the
last, that was in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I calculate that, I think that's
over 25 years over that period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first traits of interest was
the concept of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And roots, of course, have something to do
with water and nutrients and anchoring and
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody had really got a very good
handle on the genetics of roots at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one of those tantalizing
opportunities to see whether these
[SPEAKER_00]: different root structures, which you see
in this photograph, could actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: tractable as genetic characteristics of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at salinity and submergence
tolerance and iron toxicity tolerance in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of things that had to do with the
soils in these rain-fed areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a pathologist coming out of a
pathology background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was also very interested in diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first one is rice blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one to the side is the bacterial
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the green leaf popper is a
transmittable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the litter of a virus, the yellow
model virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these were early on of the Tungra
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were early on the kind of traits
that I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a relationship with a guy who
was a soil scientist there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that, I developed an interest
in understanding nitrogen fixation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that this was
genetically tractable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published the very, very first
paper showing that you could track genes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant that corresponded to the
ability to fix or stimulate nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is associative nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not nodular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was obviously some kind of
exudate coming out of those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have the tools at that time to
study further either what the exudates
[SPEAKER_00]: were or which microbes were doing the
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to mention this paper
was published, as you see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a very early start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the material that can be used to
pursue that today, if I were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes today, that's one of the
things I would certainly pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also fascinated by domestication
and, as I said, the early land raises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does a geneticist and a breeder
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do a lot of crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, crossing in rice, you see this
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually emasculate every
single floret that you're going to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite a laborious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clip the floret just before the
answers are up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can make your crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still done manually throughout all
cross areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were developing populations in
those days, mostly biparental populations
[SPEAKER_00]: that were the source of QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, this is 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a big deal because this was
an opportunity to get at traits
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically that had only been able to be
under selection by breeders at the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were looking for parents that
were, of course, they had trait contrast,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in one case, susceptible or resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be genetically divergent
because we only had 135 RFLPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want those RFLPs to be
polymorphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take two lines that are very
closely related, you wouldn't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: markers to cover the genome to do a QTL
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these were indica by japonica
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be crossable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted fast generation time because we
were making these immortal recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go on about the details of
this, but I just want to say that many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the populations that we made in the early
90s when I first went to Erie are still
[SPEAKER_00]: the basis of what is being used to derive
and clone genes today and also to drive a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the breeding that I'll talk about
in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were indica by tropical japonica
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The countries of origin were things like
the Co 39 by Morabarican.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were from India and from Cote d
'Ivoire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were irrigated by upland crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They segregated for all kinds of pests and
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They segregated for root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They segregated for drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They segregated for seed size,
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bottleneck, of course,
was phenotyping because you could genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: one population if you could create the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would take several years,
but you had two or three seasons a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could do this fairly rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I'm going to say is we created
several populations, and those populations
[SPEAKER_00]: are, in fact, a source of wealth today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get your hands on them,
they're publicly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're ever working on rice,
and I'll tell you more about the kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: resources we've built, these are really
good opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, I have the seeds right
here at Cornell, should anybody want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the early papers was this paper
called Locating Genes Associated with Root
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphology and Drought Avoidance in Rice
via Linkage to Molecular Markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my graduate student, Mike Shampoo,
who you see up in the upper right-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, led this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was published in 95, and I only got
to Erie in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot of work, and I want to
just walk through what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grew rice in the greenhouse using
these PV C pipes, because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring root depth and doing some
calibrations on root thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew them in aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have hydroponics, but we had
aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the length of those
roots, those are only six-week-old plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were because we had an upland
variety in our cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also grew them in the field,
and we've held water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's what we call managed stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to apply stress when we
wanted to, because we had irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was all RFLPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so RFLPs, of course, are really
cumbersome and really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the Takeishi there
grinding the tissue on liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we produced this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the map that I produced here at
Cornell before I went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had about 150 markers in those
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those little boxes you see to the left
of each of the 12 chromosomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating where we had, let's say,
QTLs associated with root morphology,
[SPEAKER_00]: either from these greenhouse or
aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where they overlapped is the
coloration or the barbershop holes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes where they overlapped with
field-level drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were starting to show that you could
find regions of chromosomes where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could associate root traits and root
morphological characteristics with
[SPEAKER_00]: performance under drought in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was absolutely revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I took this result to my boss,
Ediri, he looked at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't name him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very famous rice breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at me, and he said, Susan,
QTLs are a figment of your imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice he was not on the list
of authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will note that one of the people who
is on this list of authors, he will come
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the story a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note Dave McKill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm going to highlight this little
region at the bottom of chromosome 9
[SPEAKER_00]: because part of the story I'm going to
tell that has to do with Dave McKill comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the bottom of chromosome 9,
that QTL comes back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we had a lot of cleaning and
counting and measuring of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a team, or Mike Shampoo had a
team, of people that were all involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this team of people would work day and
night to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had plastic bags in the PVC pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would cut them at certain depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would wash, measure, weigh,
and with a caliper measure the width of
[SPEAKER_00]: these roots to look at root
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, this is an extraction of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a lot of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed a lot of DNA to do southern
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these were P32 labeled blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you are shaking your heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you've been around as long as I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this was a tremendous challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see very clearly the scientific
potential of our mapping, our QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marker-assisted selection was right on
the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this process was really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to generate bi-parental
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do phenotyping and genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was RFLPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really laborious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes had to come in through
Philippine customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nothing like the work that we do
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each population segregated for only
two alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started making lots of different
populations because everybody was sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that their particular combination was the
one that would be most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people, so many moving parts,
so many expensive reagents, and so little
[SPEAKER_00]: connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So information didn't move that easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these were pre-internet days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so data sharing was difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data management was beginnings of Excel
files.
[SPEAKER_00]: But data analytics, we didn't have the
computational power we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this made it into a way I
started thinking, this is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taking way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not making the kind of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, the breeders were going along
independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were completely irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagreed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagreed with my boss that these were
figments of our imaginations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were clearly not on the breeding
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I came back to Cornell after five
years at ERI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genomics was moving down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were moving out of RFLPs and moving
into SSRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my grand visions was to be able
to genotype the gene bank at ERI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, wouldn't that be wonderful?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could just genotype the gene bank,
we could make digital selections as to
[SPEAKER_00]: which kinds of materials we wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't exactly as easy as it is
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did get our first NSF grant to
build a roadmap of natural variation in
[SPEAKER_00]: rice based on, obviously, a selection of
the materials in the gene bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much diversity is there in sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it organized?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where is it found?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've already seen the maps in the
distributions of ecologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we wanted to add a molecular
genotypic layer to over lay on what we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought we knew based on phenotype and
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can we learn about
genotype-phenotype associations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start making predictions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what knowledge and tools do we need to
accelerate breeding and the management of
[SPEAKER_00]: new rice varieties given that RFLPs were
not going to do the job?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we did was to collect a
sample of diversity from the gene bank
[SPEAKER_00]: based on mostly geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we focused on land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some elites in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of land races because that's
where the maximum amount of variation was,
[SPEAKER_00]: after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our collection was from across the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using SSRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we moved quickly into SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think our lab here at Cornell has
been in the vanguard of providing markers
[SPEAKER_00]: to everyone in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never protected them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put everything into the public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even today, there isn't a QTL paper
that's published that isn't using the
[SPEAKER_00]: markers out of the Cornell lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been very proud, actually,
when I go around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many people tell me that they're
so grateful that they were able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this technology as it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the first thing we did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we looked at the subpopulation
structure of sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well known that there are two
varietal groups, the japonica and the
[SPEAKER_00]: indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the picture in the upper right-hand
corner shows you what my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues taught me when I first went to
Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said there are three subpopulations,
the japonica, the japonica, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the japonica is simply the tropical
version of temperate japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two are the japonicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this thing called
indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told me everybody in the world
who produces high-yielding rice is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing indica rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some analysis using, first of all,
our SSRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw sort of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the indica group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't quite conform to the picture
that they had painted for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the tropical japonica
and the temperate japonica, the blue and
[SPEAKER_00]: the green here on the left, are very
closely related in the PCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, they are very distinct in the
minds of the Erie breeders because they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in such different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very closely related
evolutionarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, this huge group that they said
was indica turns out to have two very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive evolutionarily distinctive
subgroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not well differentiated either
in terms of their geography, where they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, nor in terms of their morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're easily crossable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is called indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is called oush, which is a
Bengali word for the season of the year in
[SPEAKER_00]: which these rice have grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the oush subpopulation, as it turns
out, had always been considered part of
[SPEAKER_00]: indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from this PCA, I think you can see
that evolutionarily, it is almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: different from indica as the tropical
japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flew in the face of all that was known
about rice genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, we applied the molecular
markers to the kind of material that was
[SPEAKER_00]: being grown in the US, which is high
yielding and subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody called it indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we showed that it's all tropical
japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything grown in the US is tropical
japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no indica that's grown in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of it all, I don't know if
you see this little thing called aromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle, that little purple,
that cluster of dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the famous basmati, the supreme
quality rice, which is exported,
[SPEAKER_00]: which everybody, or most people in the
world, really value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it showed that actually the aromatic
is not indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always called indica because it has
long sling grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's an admixture between oush,
and japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was even more heretical for the
Indians who prized this rice and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistanis who prized this rice as being
of indica origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just been an interesting road for
me because I had no preconception about
[SPEAKER_00]: any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no national identity bound up
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things didn't sort out the way that we
thought they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped explain why it was so
difficult to make basmati by indica
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses because actually basmati is more
japonica-like than it is indica-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some geographical distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say, if you step back,
I hope you can see this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of red and yellow in the top
right corner on the Asian continent and
[SPEAKER_00]: subcontinent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around much of the rest of the world,
in Africa and both North and South
[SPEAKER_00]: America, it's mostly light blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light blue is the tropical japonica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red and the yellow are the oush
and the indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see that the oush and the
indica, which are predominantly grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tropical zones there in Asia,
are associated with the high-yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: types that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is interesting here is that it's
the tropical japonicas that are grown
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout most of the rest of the world,
some of which are very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielding, as we see in the United
States and in parts of South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it scrambled people's understanding
of both what we could do with our
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm and how we were combining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some extent, it helped challenge
some thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a distinct population,
which you see as these bright yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: circles centered in the Bangladeshi River
Delta and in East India, if that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive, evolutionarily distinctive
type of rice, what is it that makes it so
[SPEAKER_00]: special or isn't it special?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people claim to grow oush
varieties today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of the rest of the story that I'm
going to tell you is what we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: learning as we start looking for
stress-tolerant genes, almost 100% of
[SPEAKER_00]: which are coming from the oush
subpopulation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've constructed diversity panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our diversity panels, some of which we
constructed here with NSF funding in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with our colleagues in
Arkansas at the USDA, and some of which we
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed at Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consist of all five subpopulations,
the indica, the oush, the tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: taponica, temperate taponica, and
aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these varieties, they are mostly
traditional varieties, have all been
[SPEAKER_00]: purified for at least two generations,
and then purified from single panicles for
[SPEAKER_00]: two generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have inbred sources of seed
that can be distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my lab here, thanks to NSF funding,
put 700,000 SNPs on all 1,600 of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are now available as the basis
for association mapping in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Erie group then, in collaboration with
China, has now added an additional 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were fully sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have collectively about 4,500 lines
of rice which have been purified,
[SPEAKER_00]: are publicly available, and have
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the beg for the rest of the community
is, what do you want to do about
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can phenotype these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can request them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could request subsets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, for free, you get your genotypes
over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of phenotypes do we want to look
at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've looked at all kinds of
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very large collective now of
people who can use these lines or subsets
[SPEAKER_00]: of these lines to phenotype whatever they
want in the field, in the growth chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: in any country in the world that allows
them to import those rices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my lab has been doing quite a bit on
panicle structure, on seed size,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, and color, on stresses related to
water, on things like ons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the barbed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have followed some of that work on
disease resistance, on canopy temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then on this fast growth in response
to rising water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots and lots of different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the beauty of this is that the
students who used to come into my lab
[SPEAKER_00]: could choose a phenotype of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had material at their fingertips
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots are still some of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we did was,
15 years after our first root phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in the Philippines,
was to work with Randy Clark, who was part
[SPEAKER_00]: of Leon Cochin's lab at the USDA,
and Janelle Jung, who was a PhD student in
[SPEAKER_00]: my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy built this cool little, this was
just the early version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even cooler now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this automated or semi-automated
phenotyping system, where we grew our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, I think you can see the,
yeah, grew these plants in a Jellum gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like a sort of clear Jellum gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would rotate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the cylinder, kind of a big
cylinder, actually, in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had, that was on a revolving
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the camera and could take
revolving pictures of this, so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could reconstruct 3D images from these 2D
captured images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was the early days of what
we're calling today high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping, and image capture,
and then automated image processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I just want to say is,
we would take 40 images per plant as it
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on its base.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were imaged over different days,
because it's completely non-destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the software that Randy built,
the Root Reader 3D, software could
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstruct single 3D images of each
individual's root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, because you could have
replicated, these were all inward lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you had replicated versions of this,
you could start to look at population
[SPEAKER_00]: level, genome-wide associations,
using these reconstructed 3D images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really quite a powerful
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I think back to the days at Erie,
where we were 40 people using a caliper to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure roots, and we couldn't do anything
that was non-destructive, this was
[SPEAKER_00]: completely non-destructive, what we were
able to do was the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at root system
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used 373 individuals from all the
different subpopulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured 13 different traits over three
days in the four subpopulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't use aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not using the basmati.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using just the indica,
the oush, the temperate, and the tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: toponica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the 12 chromosomes of rice are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big lines are the QTLs,
because we had biparental crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as our association mapping panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little tiny red ones are the GWAS
QTLs, or the GWAS signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see, in some cases,
the GWAS signals overlap with the QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other cases, they sort of spanned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other cases, they were completely
independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the biparental cross was
IR64-biosusenic, captured only two
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the association mapping panel
captured many alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can appreciate that they weren't
all entirely overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, one of the take-homes of this
slide is that the QTL resolution was so
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower than the GWAS resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the same population size,
you would get much better resolved regions
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest if you used the GWAS as
compared to the QTL, or the biparental
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a Manhattan plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see along, I think most of
you probably know how to read a Manhattan
[SPEAKER_00]: plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the 12 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 700,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all lined up in linear order
as they are arrayed across the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the negative log probability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just essentially a kind of
p-value for an association between the SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: and the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the most significant SNP up at
10 to the minus 7 on chromosome 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It corresponds to this region on
chromosome 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a GWAS hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an association for root length in
the indica subpopulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at what these beautiful
concatenated images look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: now don't get upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you where there is no
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the SNP that I'm showing you is 66 kb
away from the peak SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point here is these are
concatenated images.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has 39 different individuals
replicated to form a concatenated image of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the root length was in these indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the indicas that carried the A
allele at this SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the indicas that carried the B allele
at the same SNP, there were 118 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two root lengths are roughly the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you move over and you look at the
peak SNP, which is the SNP that was
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly associated with a difference
in the phenotype in the root length,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see is that the A allele carries
the short root length, and the B allele
[SPEAKER_00]: has a longer root length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a slightly different number
because, of course, there were
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinants between this SNP and this
SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of plants in each group has
shifted slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, two take homes here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resolution is about 60 kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, if you look at the ones in
between, you start to see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see little remnants of the
difference, but it's not as significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the p-value is not as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a pretty good resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In rice, if you have a 60 kb resolution,
you're still talking about several genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you have 60 kb on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have roughly 100, 120 kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have at least 20 genes in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've narrowed your search space
considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, meanwhile, OK, we were doing this
work here, our NSF funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very excited about the new
phenotyping possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were moving quickly to get a much
higher resolution view of the associations
[SPEAKER_00]: between genotype and phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our colleagues at IRI had continued
down the road of the bi-parental mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were doing amazing work measuring
not only with calipers, but they'd also
[SPEAKER_00]: started to automate their phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to do it in the field,
which I clearly was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the collaborations that
I've had over these years have kept me in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say that while I was
doing the work here, they were doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day at PAG, the two groups were
getting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got up to give a talk, and my colleague
at IRI gave up talk right after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized we were doing the same
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing it in the field, and we were
doing it with this automated phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was, are we discovering any
of the same PPL regions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to show you that this work
involved planting rice seedlings into a
[SPEAKER_00]: spaghetti colander, which was then planted
into a tub, which was sunk into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you could manage drought,
if that's what you wanted to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that you could pull it up and clean
off the roots much as we had been doing 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years before at IRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is then you could clean
off the roots and then clip the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could measure them as they came
out of the colander.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the different phenotype that was
being measured by this group was whether
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots grew straight down or whether
they seemed to sprawl out across the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: at a different angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another group at IRI had been doing
phenomenal work looking at what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's called phosphorus
starvation tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they had come back to the
understanding that it was a root phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: that determined phosphorus uptake in
scabies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able to do this with a very
high savaging ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to my theme about roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next slide shows what the
discovery that was being made by the
[SPEAKER_00]: groups who had been doing this for 15
years in the field entailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it entailed a cross between IR64 and a
traditional upland variety from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Philippines called Kinandang Patong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kinandang Patong had very deep roots
because it was an upland variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IR64, which is the quintessential
indica out of IRI, it is planted on more
[SPEAKER_00]: acreage even today than any other rice
variety in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has very shallow roots because it's
grown in the irrigated system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't need deep roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed those two, and then he back
crossed and intra-breast the region with
[SPEAKER_00]: the largest effect QTL for deep roots into
the IR64 background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he created a near isogenic line of
IR64 carrying one region on chromosome 9
[SPEAKER_00]: that carried the deep rooted QTL from
Kinandang Patong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trait donor was, of course,
one of those early land races that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: selected for one of those bi-parental
crosses made back in the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was publicly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did he discover when he cloned
that gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: He found that this gene, which he calls
draw1, and many of you are familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: this work, that a single base pair
deletion in exon 4 changed the root angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that change in root angle,
so this is the deep rooted and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: shallow rooted, and that change in root
angle had no effect in yield under
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigated conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under moderate drought, the IR64 could
no longer keep up with yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the NIL that had that one
introgression on chromosome 9 associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with that QTL was doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under extreme drought where IR64 died,
the NIL was still able to survive and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is really remarkable is he
showed that that one base pair deletion in
[SPEAKER_00]: exon 4 that changed the root angle
enhanced grain yield under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he could show it because he developed
the NILs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pairs of lines that can go out
and be planted in the field under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for those of you who are wondering
what this gene does, it's an unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no correspondence to anything with
known function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that it's negatively
regulated by auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows a higher expression of the draw1
protein causes the downward root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are variants in the germplasm
array that have more or less production of
[SPEAKER_00]: the draw1 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in cell elongation at the
root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it localizes to the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to move quickly because I
have a feeling I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go on and say, and I hope Kenang
Yu is on in Geneva, because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: feature some of the work that Kenang Yu
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did it originally at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an important story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with the sub1A gene,
which confers submergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one I just talked about was draw1,
which is related to the downward growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, which confers drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a different phenotype
entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a phenotype now that is of
great importance in the same RAIN-fed
[SPEAKER_00]: systems where the drought is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for submergence tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the submergence
tolerance is conferred by what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: the sub1A gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a single base pair change in
a gene of unknown function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete addition of a new member
of an ethylene response factor gene
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, Kenang showed in his
work when he actually cloned this gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that the sub1A was the new member.
[SPEAKER_00]: The B and C are shared with the reference
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the A gene was not present at all in
the reference genome, which is why it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a challenge to clone in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular donor was called
FR13A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Ausland race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carries this incredible opportunity to
survive under submergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically holds its breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an ethylene response factor gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to tell this bit of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you look at the citation that's
up there, some of you may recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: name Kaufman, William Ronnie Kaufman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ronnie Kaufman was a breeder before
myself and before Dave McKill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at Erie in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the papers that he produced in
1981 was called Inheritance of Submergence
[SPEAKER_00]: Tolerance in Rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the take home of that paper was that
there was a single major gene associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with submergence tolerance and that it
would be important in the rain-fed lowland
[SPEAKER_00]: areas throughout South Asia where flash
floods were a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was followed by a paper by Dave
McKill who came in as Ronnie 's
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement for the rain-fed lowland
breeding program at Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he published a paper where he had
actually improved semi-dwarf varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were high-yielding varieties,
by intergressing this gene into those
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dave McKill, when Ronnie came back to
Cornell, Dave McKill took his place at
[SPEAKER_00]: Erie and was still there when I went
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dave McKill was trying to breed based
on phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had to flood these things and see
which ones survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I got there, Dave McKill came
to me and said, I know exactly what I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make this population with this
donor because it survives under
[SPEAKER_00]: submergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to do a QTL analysis with your
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to give me markers so me,
I as a breeder, can start moving it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the backgrounds that I really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that project, which again started
in the early 90s, took the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually a cloning project back at the
University of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kinong Zhu, who is today an apple
breeder up in Geneva, did this incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: work where he had to clone a gene that
didn't exist in the reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was quite challenging for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they'd cloned it, they were able
to move this gene quite readily into other
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me just say, before they'd cloned
the genes, they knew where it was based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the early work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those markers went to the genome
mapping lab that I had initiated at Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people started putting it into the
major varieties that were planted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded zones across South and Southeast
Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had a line in the Swarna
background, which is one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly planted farmer-preferred
varieties throughout this rain-fed lowland
[SPEAKER_00]: area in India and Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had put the Sub1 gene into,
through backcrossing, had put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: Swarna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those varieties were already in the
early testing phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm showing you here is what
happens under a drought, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: under a submergence of 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30 days after planting, the crop is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a flash flood comes and sits on
top of the rice for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it pretty much wipes out the Swarna
that doesn't have the Sub1 in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sub1 has come from an outland race
called FR13A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have that in progression in
your line, your material holds its breath
[SPEAKER_00]: until the water subsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can do that for about 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the water subsides,
it can regrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this saves people from what they're
doing here is they're trying to go back in
[SPEAKER_00]: and replant that field in order to salvage
their crop for that season, where here
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have to replant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the value of this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a lot of foresight because the
first crosses were made in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gene was cloned in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the back crossing had already
begun at Erie once they had markers from
[SPEAKER_00]: the earlier bi-parental QPL mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're showing here is the number
of different backgrounds that they used
[SPEAKER_00]: for introgression of that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Dave McKill with great foresight
thought, if we're successful, this gene
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be put into different backgrounds
for different countries where different
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers have different grain quality
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we get it into the varieties that
they already like, then it'll be an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: swap for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking them to do anything
different than they've already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make near-isogenic lines,
and they'll see for themselves whether
[SPEAKER_00]: this is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this started at Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was Sefti's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sefti also was a student out of my lab who
then was at Erie doing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they moved it through back crossing
into a variety of different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see in this graph is that the
sub-1 variety always outperform the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-sub-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under increasing days of submergence,
although they all decline a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the submergence quality, the sub-1
varieties always do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within five years, the first
releases, the actual first variety
[SPEAKER_00]: releases were in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within five years, 10 million farmers and
10 million hectares of rain-fed lowland
[SPEAKER_00]: land, of flash flood-prone rain-fed
lowland land were covered with sub-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the backgrounds are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one gene is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 450 different government,
NGO, farmer organization, and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that were involved in getting
this material out from Erie and from that
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program out to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of the record uptakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the fact that they chose to do
this by not redefining the variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: just redefining one trait, helped with
that uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say that they had a
whole strategy for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being part of a strategy, any of you
who do work, that even if you start by
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning a gene, if you can plug into one
of these networks, your work may take off
[SPEAKER_00]: and really have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important that you
understand the strategy behind the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do, because these strategies are
not simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They involve many, many, many people,
public sector, private sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: government, NGO, as we were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, here are a few points
that I would like to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sub-1 gene was introduced in the
farmer preferred varieties, as I've said,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one different for a different target
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flood-prone areas themselves that were
being targeted were identified using
[SPEAKER_00]: remote sensing, GIS, and ground
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there are a whole slew of
people in the government already using
[SPEAKER_00]: digital technologies to figure out where
the most likely occurrence of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses is, especially with climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: At-risk villages then were targeted for
variety that we call participatory variety
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, or PBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all prior to release,
so it was part of the selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used male and female farmer input
to make sure that women who were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of preparing this on the culinary
side, or who were involved with the
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting, were involved in the
decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also included local checks so
everybody could see for themselves whether
[SPEAKER_00]: these varieties were something they wanted
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of trying to plant one target
area with a large expanse, they chose to
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute mini kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are about five pages of seed per
village.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were provided to thousands of
targeted villages to allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer-to-farmer dissemination of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is all inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers save their own seed, and when it's
good, it moves very quickly from farmer to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't require seed companies in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coordination that was required was
quite considerable, and this was all
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinated under what they call the
STRESA project, thanks to the Bill and
[SPEAKER_00]: Melinda Gates Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
is very big right now in trying to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of coordination that is needed
between the scientists, the breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: the government and agencies, and the
technology exchange that is required to
[SPEAKER_00]: really make this kind of thing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming down to the end of my talk,
and I just want to say there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful stories about the one gene at a
time that make a big difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sub-1 and the semi-dwarf before it,
and the PISTL, which is the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: starvation tolerance gene, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell many of these stories,
but really the question is, is one gene at
[SPEAKER_00]: a time enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think about what's happening
around us, and the climate is changing
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, and people are fleeing the
countryside in droves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly due to climate change, and the
civil unrest and the disasters that
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, as I go back to think about
the beginning of the talk, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: export market for rice is so inelastic
that when there's a crop failure due to
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change, there isn't enough in the
international market to make the rice
[SPEAKER_00]: available that people need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a massive kind of feeling of
unrest, and an accelerated desire to move
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I know I've gone through a
little bit over time, and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to take you down this road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the rise of the Walmart model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all affected by it, and breeding is
affected by it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You generate infinite amounts of data on
every aspect of your subject matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's toothpaste, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart, it's not all about breeding and
other people that need our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use machine learning algorithms to
define patterns and generate hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you learn from the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You validate your models.
[SPEAKER_00]: You redefine your hypotheses by testing on
new populations and new environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way that Walmart moves is
they figure out what works in one
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look for the population that's most
like it, and they take that exact retail
[SPEAKER_00]: model, and they start applying it
somewhere else, and it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use validated models to predict
behavior or performance of future
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and environments, and you beat
the competition using data and
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This model is the model right now,
the big data model, that most of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: working under, and it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our parallel in breeding and
genetics, where you collect lots of data
[SPEAKER_00]: on phenotype, on environment, on genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You develop models as quickly as you can
that integrate all of those and help you
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the performance of your lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You continuously update your models.
[SPEAKER_00]: You iteratively improve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use predicted breeding values to
increase selection intensity, increase
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy, and decrease cycle time,
and then you modify your breeding design
[SPEAKER_00]: to take advantage of new efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Walmart model in breeding,
and we're all being asked to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate for reasons that we all
understand, but it's taking us down this
[SPEAKER_00]: road of more, constantly more,
faster, and hopefully better, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this two-world phenomenon,
the thing I call, or my colleagues over in
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering call, the digital twin
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have breeding pipelines, which are
basically a collage of genetic resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding populations, and improved lines
that are cross-evaluated, selected,
[SPEAKER_00]: and recombined in a recurrent cycle in
biological time under field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That material is physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge about that material is dynamic
and evolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And side by side, you have a genomics
pipeline, which is a collage of algorithms
[SPEAKER_00]: and analytical procedures that process,
reprocess, intersect, and integrate data
[SPEAKER_00]: in parallel computing streams,
generating a series of models and
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions about future performance to
guide selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is representational and it
resides in cyberspace, and hopefully it
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects the reality, the physical
reality, of the food that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce in order to maintain livelihoods
and to maintain adequate human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the challenge for our generation,
or for actually, I would say, the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, is really the challenge of how
you're gonna integrate automation and big
[SPEAKER_00]: data into a conception of the world that
still maintains touch with reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have digital tools, data streams,
simulation, and prediction, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely revolutionized the way we see
the world and our ability to make
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions about the future world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's imposing disruptive change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question as I come to the close of
this is, can we integrate the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we continue to discover diverse
alleles and mechanisms that confer
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience and nutrient use efficiency,
and also to use genomic selection or
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic prediction to efficiently combine
them with all the alleles that we have for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and quality in our elite breeding
material?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna just end by these few thoughts
I have at the end of this presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that beyond breeding and
statistics, rice is also a bridge to human
[SPEAKER_00]: history and deeply held cultural values
and perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a source of beauty, it's an
essential natural resource, it's a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that provides livelihoods, promotes health
and wellbeing, and it's the foundation for
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership, education, and innovation,
and for me, a source of inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I thank you all for
listening, and I thank the group that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with and my funding sources over
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
