[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of my talk today is Variation in
Winter Survival Mechanisms of Wild and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to point out that I
don't like to work with grapevines when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ugly, green, and filled with
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I prefer to be out in the field in the
middle of the winter when it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable and the vines look like
they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into the actual
research, I wanted to give a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of an enhanced introduction to
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As was brought up, my background's in
molecular biology and plant biology in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my graduate and postdoctoral work was
mostly in population genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: population ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with cultivated and wild
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I moved on to my postdoc,
I worked with bentgrass and canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had a lot of experience
jumping around in different plant systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and always from a population biology
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to understand crops and
their wild ancestors and the traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've managed to select from the wild and
then use for crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout my studies, I've always been
very interested in adaptation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of stress responses in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's particularly interesting
that plants can't remove themselves from a
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to adapt or they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the past, I've worked on a
number of different stressful conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant's point of view,
including aluminum tolerance in rice and
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide resistance and drought
resistance in canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bentgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to make a point
of is that in jumping around in these
[SPEAKER_00]: different systems and looking at
population genetics and population
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology, I tend to also move between the
lab and the field frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a good set of molecular
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also tend to do a lot of
experimental work out in the field and in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses like are pictured down here on
the bottom right to set up stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and try to model how the
climate might be changing and affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I just wanted to also introduce
the USDA ARS GGRU or the Grape Genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based up on the Cornell Extension
campus in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside GGRU, we have two major research
programs, which are titled up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a research program looking at
improving grape root stock and scion pest
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a second program called the Genetics
and Genomics of Grape Growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Development and Quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the program that I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inclusive of these two programs,
there are five research scientists with
[SPEAKER_00]: associated support staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganyu Wangzong is our research leader,
and he focuses on functional genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lance Kale-Davidson focuses on biotic
stress genetics, particularly powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and downy mildew of grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Owens focuses on fruit quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angela Baldo is our computational
biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as was pointed out, I joined the group
a year ago, and my focus is abiotic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, with focus on cold tolerance,
but also dabbling in drought resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and salinity resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a premier in case anybody isn't
familiar with grapevines, Vitis vinifera,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated grapevine, is one of the most
important horticultural fruit crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consumed as fresh fruit, dried for
raisins, or pressed for juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: or fermented in wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually about 71% of the grapes that
are grown are grown for wine production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapevine is really interesting from a
population genetics and population ecology
[SPEAKER_00]: point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of cultivars grown
across the world, but many of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something perfect about growing
conditions thousands of years ago that
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers vegetatively propagated a certain
set of cultivars time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those cultivars are grown across
the planet in a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really interesting from the point
of view of abiotic stress adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a sequenced genome that
allows us to start applying molecular and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic tools towards understanding how
traits are inherited, traits are
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the population biology point of view,
there are three different gene pools in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genus Vitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Asia, there's approximately 40 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about two European species,
Vitis vinifera is the cultivated grape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and its wild ancestor is also considered
European.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in North America, we have roughly 20
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these numbers change a little bit
depending on who you talk to, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the general layout of wild Vitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the USDA in Geneva, we maintain the
cold hardy grape germplasm for the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have roughly 1,600 different
genotypes of which we have all the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed some of the species here in
the bottom right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are species names that I'll be
using throughout the rest of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitis estivalis, Scinaria, Labrusca,
Rhyperia, Rupestris, and Volpina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an idea of the
distribution of these species,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've placed three of them on the board
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitis rhyperia is in the top left corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can see, the lime green is a
county level distribution of where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find records of Rhyperia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it's really diverse in the
type of climates that it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: inhabiting in the US, all the way from
southern Louisiana to Manitoba and Quebec,
[SPEAKER_00]: and west to east from Colorado and Montana
to the northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine a lot of different
climate gradients exist in that swath of
[SPEAKER_00]: geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of potential for wild
grape accessions to carry unique
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations to some of these abiotic
stresses that I'm tasked with working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put up Vitis labrusca and Vitis
estivalis just as another comparison in
[SPEAKER_00]: that almost all of these wild species have
a very wide geographic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the different species have the
potential to be mined for important
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to mention that cold stress
response and hardiness is a really complex
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different traits that
could be playing a role and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: different time points throughout the
growing season that cold stress could be
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note that cold stress is
tissue dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at green tissues versus
dormant tissues, what the plant perceives
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cold stress could be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots versus shoots perceive temperature,
salinity, drought, all very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to kind of dial down and
figure out which traits are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: workable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a vast array of mechanical
and molecular mechanisms that contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can remove a damaged plant organ
and avoid cold shock, it's one potential
[SPEAKER_00]: way to get around sustained damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could have an army of molecular
chaperones that help stabilize membranes
[SPEAKER_00]: and proteins when the plant is undergoing
a cold shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down on the bottom of the screen is my
attempt to draw a growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to illustrate here is that
as the plants go from winter to spring
[SPEAKER_00]: through summer to fall and back into
winter, there are different points in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season that cold can affect the
plant survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: In winter, we could have very sharp drops
in temperature that kill dormant tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the spring, after bud burst,
unseasonable frost can damage green
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing can occur in the fall prior
to plants having enough time to acclimate
[SPEAKER_00]: and go to sleep before the coming winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sort of stresses, the tissue
dependence and the difference in defense
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms are shared across perennial
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of variation in what
tactics work for different model systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one general theme are these cold
binding factor genes, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factors that seem to be
activated by cold and drought stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: create a molecular cascade of defense
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of cold tolerance in
growing tissues is to prevent ice
[SPEAKER_00]: formation from forming inside of living
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is also my personal attempt to
draw what cold damage looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an art degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant cell on the left with an
attempt at thylakoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitochondria, nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine there's lots of different
cell organs inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant perceives freezing stress,
it tries to export water to prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of ice forming inside the living
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water can freeze outside of cells and not
damage the living tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is called the high temperature
exotherm, where ice freezes and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: cause lethal damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as temperature continues to decrease,
the ice creates a water gradient that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes water to continuously be pulled
from the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cell starts to be stressed by
dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if dehydration becomes extreme,
you can start having membranes fusing
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, the molecular and
mechanical mechanisms that are defenses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are mounted to prevent ice formation
within the cell fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have ice crystals form within the
living cell causing lethal damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is called the low temperature
exotherm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to avoid this, say it gets
warmer, water can reenter the cell as the
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient is switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your membranes have fused together,
you can have lethal damage, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant tissue didn't freeze solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as the membranes re-expand,
they rip apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you lose cellular function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole list of potential
mechanisms to prevent this cascade from
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's avoidance mechanisms like super
cooling, transporting the water out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, formation of sugar glasses to keep
membranes apart, tissue barriers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also mechanisms that are typically
called tolerance mechanisms, where
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes may change their polarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be chaperones emplaced inside
membranes to prevent them from fusing with
[SPEAKER_00]: one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cryoprotective proteins could be produced
to help stabilize protein function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compatible solutes could be produced
to increase the plant cell's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold onto water, even when there is a
water gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like if you try to
put it into molecular terms, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process of coal and dehydration stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green arrows are promoter arrows,
red repressor signs are genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: function as repressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to just bring up was that
you have cold or changes in light or
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydration, some sort of external
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads to a transcription factor cascade
that culminates here in the CBF regulon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I mentioned the cold binding
factor genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genes activate a whole series of
downstream genes called core genes and kin
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, many of which we don't know what
they do, other than they lead to the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of cryoprotectants and
compatible solutes, sometimes soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars, all which are thought to help with
that prevention of lethal dehydration and
[SPEAKER_00]: ice formation within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different aspects of cold
stress and hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dormancy and reduced
deacclimation, so how the plant perceives
[SPEAKER_00]: winter is coming, how it goes to sleep,
and then reactivates in the summer or the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwinter bud survival is understanding
how buds can survive lower and lower
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures without having that internal
ice occurrence, and then survival against
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and fall frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that pops in my mind is
maybe we don't need to worry about cold
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If climate change is occurring and global
temperatures are rising, we just need to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a couple more years, and then winters
will be 70, and there's no reason for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about the way that
climate change is predicted to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's supposed to be more and more
erratic weather patterns, and so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential for rapid changes in
temperature exposing green tissues to
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of when that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pictures from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2006, if we look at early April,
what the phenology of the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like, versus roughly 20 days later,
you can see that there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, a lot more bud burst in those 20
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind you, this is from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like in April of the
following year, after they've had a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very warm month of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenology is advanced by several weeks,
and this must sound very similar to what
[SPEAKER_00]: we had this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenology gets advanced a month early,
then we have a return to normal cold space
[SPEAKER_00]: spring temperatures that wipes out early
green tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that the dark green has
been completely reset to the lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: green, showing you that there's been a lot
of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's estimated that this particular
Easter freeze caused somewhere around $2
[SPEAKER_00]: billion worth of agriculture and
horticultural damage, impacting lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: our standard crops, wheat, rye,
barley, and corn, and then all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit crops, which are listed down here at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the sort of climate,
swift changes in climate that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about as far as cold tolerance
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I should keep my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green tissues are very cold,
tender, and they can't survive long bouts
[SPEAKER_00]: of freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on grapes, this is important to note
because grapes are primarily fruitful in
[SPEAKER_00]: the primary bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inflorescence maristems are laid down
the year before, and so whatever bursts
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that primary bud is where you're
gonna get your fruit and your harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a killing frost in the early
spring that kills off the first bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will usually survive because
they'll push buds from secondary and
[SPEAKER_00]: tertiary buds, but they'll be far less
fruitful if they produce fruit at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really bad from the farmer's
point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just illustrates what that sort
of frost kill looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the end of the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to now tell you about
three sort of preliminary studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: were conducting to try to get at looking
at grapevine cold tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one's gonna be looking at
dormancy, chilling, and deacclimation in
[SPEAKER_00]: wild grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're gonna look a little bit at
midwinter bud hardiness and finish up with
[SPEAKER_00]: a little discussion on osmotic mechanisms
that could be contributing to midwinter
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, acclimation and dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize if this is a little too
redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where everybody is on cold
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as dormancy goes from the point
of view from the plant, there's several
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the growing season, basil buds are
thought of as being paradormant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is right here, where apical buds are
suppressing the growth of those buds
[SPEAKER_00]: through hormone control.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants enter fall and they start
receiving lower temperature cues and light
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature cues, you have a change in
molecular and metabolic status that tells
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to start going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called endodormancy once the
plant's gone fully to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really haven't gotten to the middle
of winter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final stage of dormancy is
ecodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs after endodormancy has been
fulfilled by currently some unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is ready to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing keeping it from growing is
the fact that it's still winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental parameters of growth
are not favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those are lifted, growth resumes in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is sort of what the curve in
dormancy looks like, pictured here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acclimation takes place over several
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deepest hardiness and dormancy occurs
in the middle of the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you enter spring,
deacclimation and resumption of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs at a much faster rate than the
plant took to become acclimated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of cold that the plant needs to
experience to fulfill endodormancy is
[SPEAKER_00]: important because if the plant doesn't
achieve that magical number, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: return to growing conditions in the
spring, buds will not burst synchronously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have growth occur on grapevines,
but it'll be a spotty, one bud here,
[SPEAKER_00]: one bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desynchronized bud burst leads to very
desynchronized flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And desynchronized fruiting,
desynchronized ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so farmers don't want to be harvesting
grapes at multiple time points in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go through and get it all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to have grapevines
that are able to satisfy the endodormancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chilling requirement, prior to the
growing season, depending on where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads us to this idea of a dream
grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing grapes in a warm
climate, you want a grapevine that goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep in the winter, but only needs a
small winter, because you only have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small winter, that will, leading to
grapevines that will then burst
[SPEAKER_00]: synchronously in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cold climates, we don't mind so much
how long the chilling hours are,
[SPEAKER_00]: because our winters are plenty long.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want is a grapevine that comes out
of dormancy and kind of takes its time,
[SPEAKER_00]: slows itself down, because otherwise you
end up with what we ended up last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have grapevines pushing in the early
spring, followed by a sudden frost,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we lose parts of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on where you're growing
grapevines on what sort of traits you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do to assess chilling
requirement in wild grapevines is we go
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the germplasm in November,
early November, and take cuttings right
[SPEAKER_00]: after the first killing frost,
the frost that knocks down the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect a whole bunch of canes and put
them in a cold room at five degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five degrees C is sort of the sweet spot
for the cold clock in grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they're held at five degrees or
lower, they start counting towards the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of that endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then take the cuttings out of the cold
room at several time points during the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter and put them in forcing conditions
and see if they're ready, if they've
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfilled that endodormancy time limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just, the picture on the left here
is what the experiment looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bunch of cuttings in a growth
chamber, and we go down and assess whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the data looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: From one of these experiments pictured
here is results from the cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevine Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have sort of a randomly chosen time
point to assess when endodormancy has
[SPEAKER_00]: ended, and that's at four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If 50% of the buds have burst after four
weeks in forcing conditions, we consider
[SPEAKER_00]: endodormancy to be fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here that for Cabernet
Sauvignon, we don't really call the 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: bud burst until, oh yeah, Geneva can't see
my pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep forgetting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say around 1,000 hours of cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this graph, the far
right line is the darkest red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's zero hours in the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut it from the field, put it in a
growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you step back in lines and in
more and more pink color, these are time
[SPEAKER_00]: points where the cuttings have been in the
cold room for a longer and longer period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that it takes about 1,000
hours for Cabernet Sauvignon to be ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I want you to note is
the longer that you keep them in the cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: the faster they burst and the more
synchronous they burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple different clocks going
on here, an ultimate clock and then one
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can speed up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the journal level cutoff
for endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50% bud burst at four weeks in
forcing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a little subjective though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to show you tons and tons
of graphs, but I wanted to show how we
[SPEAKER_00]: have variation within the germplasm
samples that I'm evaluating from the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have genotypes that require very low
amounts of chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top of the slide here,
we have Riesling and then a wild species,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitis riperia from Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see for both of these
cultivars that they satisfy their
[SPEAKER_00]: endodormancy with very little chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with increased chilling, you actually
have, with the Riperia from Manitoba,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't require any start.
[SPEAKER_00]: At seven days, they've burst to
completion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very fast out of the gates
after a certain amount of cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have genotypes that require high
amounts of chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's two wild species, Vitis fulpina
on the left and Vitis rupestris on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see by looking at the
distribution of the lines, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: require a lot more chilling in order to
satisfy that bud burst requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another way of looking at the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take all the cuttings that were
placed into the growth chamber after 500
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of chilling, this is how many days
they require before they burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you an idea that there are
some varieties that will not burst at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 hours actually means never burst in
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these buds, though they're totally
viable, don't burst after eight weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: without chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need this chilling in order to get
that counter going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, you can see that they get
better and better in bursting with
[SPEAKER_00]: increased chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want you to know is that
there's a big difference between,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this example, Amurensis on the bottom,
which requires very little chilling and
[SPEAKER_00]: bursts faster and faster and faster,
and Vulpina, which requires a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even after 2000 hours, it's increased
its chilling time, but it can never really
[SPEAKER_00]: match the speed of Amurensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's got to be some genetic
control over the clock and the speed of
[SPEAKER_00]: that clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture on the bottom is three accessions
of Vitis fulpina and three accessions of
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitis cinaria, just demonstrating to you
that we have variation within a species
[SPEAKER_00]: for the response as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Vulpina, you can see that all three
varieties start out together the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they accumulate chilling
hours, they start to diverge in their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to hit any particular bud burst
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinaria is kind of the opposite in that
with very little chilling, the three
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties are very diverse in their
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as they accumulate chilling
hours, they converge on a set.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's three weeks to bud
burst after 2000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just to illustrate some of the
phenotype that we're trying to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: with dormancy and bud burst rates in wild
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to also understand how this might
relate to midwinter bud hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the trait that's been the focus of
the majority of grapevine breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grapevine breeders have typically used
Vitis riparia from northern locations in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been very successful in conveying
midwinter bud hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've placed up here two examples,
Marquette and Frontenac, both of which are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive the temperatures of
negative 36 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with this may be that Vitis
riparia sessions can be very prone to
[SPEAKER_00]: early bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put down here, again, the Manitoba
sample that I showed you before,
[SPEAKER_00]: that after a long winter, they're able to
break bud after one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a situation where we have a really
warm March and then a very cold April,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that carries a lot of riparia
background might be more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: frost damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to understand how genotypes
differ in midwinter hardiness in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: make good breeding decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we assess midwinter hardiness using
digital thermal analysis, which is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at that low-temperature exotherm that I
pointed out in my cartoon, the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: at which the water freezes inside cells,
signaling lethality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this by excising buds from the
field, putting them in this nifty
[SPEAKER_00]: programmable freezer, lowering the
temperature over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the water inside the bud goes from
liquid to crystal and it freezes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a small release of heat,
which is registered as a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to observe at what
temperature buds die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, pictured in the graph,
you can see two strong peaks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two primary buds from two bud
cuttings as the temperature caused lethal
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a very small peak afterwards,
which is probably a secondary bud that was
[SPEAKER_00]: still attached to the cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary and tertiary buds tend to be a
little bit hardier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can track these hardiness values
throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what last winter looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are daily min and max temperatures
with the freezing point illustrated here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the horizontal black line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flip between Fahrenheit and Celsius
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it until I was practicing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go with relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always below the freezing point in
these graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see with our winter is it
was pretty warm in November and December.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a little bit chilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then around New Year's, we got a pulse of
very cold weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another few days of very,
very cold weather warmed back up and we
[SPEAKER_00]: had a super warm mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to see this go,
you'd see our April come crashing back
[SPEAKER_00]: down on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the DTA results for Vitis
vinifera, Cabfranc and Riesling,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the values from this past
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the LT50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the temperature had dipped down and
intersected with one of these lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would expect about 50% of the buds on
that plant to have been killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, good news, nobody had
that problem this winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also mention that this is all
data that's been collected in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with Tim Martenson,
who runs the extension on the Geneva
[SPEAKER_00]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: His group does all the collection of the
buds and the DTA runs, and then I do some
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like if you look at
hybrid varieties, Concord and Noire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a similar pattern to the
vinifera in that they decrease with
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature over time, but then they get
much more responsive to switches in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dips in low temperature cause dips in
the DTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Concord and Noire are able to respond
to that cold signal better or faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: the vinifera cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like if you overlay
them, just so you can get an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, mind you, none of these cultivars
experienced damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all plenty hardy, but it's still
interesting to me that the hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars are able to respond at points
when the vinifera cannot respond or
[SPEAKER_00]: chooses not to, does not respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm interested in understanding if
that is a trait that correlates with the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild germplasm and if that's something
that we can select on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a example of the data that Tim
Martenson's group puts up for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers have access to this data
throughout the winter so they can make
[SPEAKER_00]: choices about their pruning technique,
whether or not they need to account for
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to their vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in 2009, 2010,
Cab Franc and Riesling, well below the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness line needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Cayuga White and Concord to
hybrid varieties, you can see that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: much more responsive in the LT50 curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look in the 2010,
2011 season, again at Concord,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that's very reactive to
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really interested in understanding
what the control is of that ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to point out is
that these changes in LTE are temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a age over winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responding to accumulating cold
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictured on the left of this graph are
riparia cuttings, one kept in the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: room, one collected from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is Volpina, same situation,
cold room and field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that with the field
exposure to cold, the LTE value for the
[SPEAKER_00]: field riparia and the field Volpina are
much, much hardier, much lower than if
[SPEAKER_00]: they were kept in the cold room under
those dormancy-inducing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to understand what promotes the
change in hardiness and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological mechanism is behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the data from this year,
looking at LTE values obtained from wild
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the V.
[SPEAKER_00]: vinifera and hybrid genotypes are pictured
on the right-hand side of the graph in
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the black graphs or bars are wild
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it far exceeds the
ability of vinifera at this early point in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've color-coded riparia blue and Volpina
pink here so that you can see that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: wide variation in the ability to get
increased cold hardiness within species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within riparia, we're seeing six degrees
difference between the samples we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Volpina, we're seeing a four-degree
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering if midwinter hardiness
and deacclimation rate can be pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This V.
[SPEAKER_00]: riparia on the right-hand here from Iowa
represents this negative 17.6 level of
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the left from Manitoba
represents the negative 23.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, if you're super hardy,
does that make you always deacclimate
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these separate modules that we can
select apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it one adaptive complex that's been
transmitted through time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're working on figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I wanted to tell you about
was trying to get at the physiology behind
[SPEAKER_00]: what could be increasing the bud
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at whether or not sugar
type or concentration could determine cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness in these four varieties that Tim
Martinson's group works on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of data from other perennial
systems and also from grape that suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: that cold hardy varieties tend to have
higher sugar concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dormant buds, at least with
grape, tend to accumulate higher levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: raffinose in hardy buds than in sensitive
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the sugar levels in those
four varieties, Concord, Noire,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cab Franc, and Riesling, to see if there's
a correlation between their bud hardiness
[SPEAKER_00]: and sugar throughout the whole season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the four sugars we look at are pictured
here at the bottom, glucose and fructose
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and
fructose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raffinose is a sucrose molecule with
galactose added on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these sort of represent a
carbohydrate pool that could be moving
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth between trisaccharide and
monosaccharide states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought maybe one of these
sugars will tell us something about
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness, but it could be that it's the
flux between the four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that actually have something to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looks like if you look
at sugar concentrations in those four
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabernet Franc and Riesling are on the
left side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord and Noire are on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to notice is that
sugars oscillate greatly throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same winter season that we
just looked at, bud hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go up, they go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always seem to go up and down
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there doesn't seem to be a pool
trade-off where we have sucrose decreasing
[SPEAKER_00]: and then glucose and fructose increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that all the sugars seem to more or
less be moving together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want you to notice is
that Concord and Noire tend to have much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher sugar levels for all sugars as well
as total sugar than the two vinifera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look just at glucose and
raffinose, you can see what I just
[SPEAKER_00]: explained that Concord and Noire have much
higher sugar levels throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Riesling, which is the more hardy
of the two viniferas, also tends to have
[SPEAKER_00]: more sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like the sugars are correlated
with bud hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to test this by looking at
33 different wild varieties to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this is just a cultivated phenotype
or if this is something that occurs across
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we don't see is the sort of
correlation that you would hope to see
[SPEAKER_00]: between sugar and DTA values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pictured here, on the left is Concord,
on the right is Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top colored line is total sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just collapsed all four sugars
together because they cycle together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's easier to look at one line
than it is to look at four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how total sugar levels
cycle throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictured behind the sugar is the daily
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the bottom is the LT50 for
Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if sugars were playing a direct
role, we would expect then as the LT50
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases in Concord that we see sugars
increase in opposition if they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: driving mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that the coldest point in
Concord's hardiness correlates with the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest point in sugar, but it's pretty
arbitrary difference between the high
[SPEAKER_00]: points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see something very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of oscillation without changes in
hardiness and no dramatic increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness that correlates with sugar
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't appear that the sugars are
driving hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does kind of look like sugars are
cycling with winter temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might just be because I stare at
these all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks a little bit to me like at
least in the beginning of the winter here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord seems to be cycling at sugars
along with changes in highs and lows.
[SPEAKER_00]: After our first real cold freeze,
the sugars kind of depart from that
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that may have something
to do with fulfillment of dormancy or some
[SPEAKER_00]: other physiological marker that we haven't
covered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're looking to see if the
sugar level correlation falls apart when
[SPEAKER_00]: we look at lots of different varieties
with lots of different hardiness levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to make a point of noting
that there could be some other
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental parameter like our winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe our winter was, it was awfully warm
and perhaps these correlations start to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall apart when you have less severe
winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of other parameters that we
haven't considered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final thing I want to leave you with
is that these are all characterization and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping research projects that we're
getting off the ground to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand which traits are the good ones
to go after for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also taking a genetic approach to
mapping some of these cold hardiness
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several segregating populations
between hybrid varieties and wild
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be screening them for chilling
requirement, bud burst, LTE, and osmolyte
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pictured here is just an example of
what we've been able to look at so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sugar level in one population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictured in the two blue arrows in the
bottom left corner are the parents of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the two parents
produce almost essentially the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of sugar in their buds, but their progeny
produce this huge transgressive array of
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're hoping to look into this some
more and see if we can figure out if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to pull traits apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just going to wrap up with that
cold stresses, cold stress and cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness is a suite of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really complicated and we're working
on trying to pull things apart into
[SPEAKER_00]: manageable bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wild germplasm that we have access to
carries variation in these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to draw on those traits in
order to improve grape germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see from the cold hardiness of
vinifera that both Riesling and Cab Franc
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go down in the middle of winter,
but they table off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of opportunity for us to
improve grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mechanism of cold hardiness really
isn't clear at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar level might have a role in it,
but it does not seem to be the driver at
[SPEAKER_00]: least with one year's worth of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to come back several times and
tell you more and more as the story
[SPEAKER_00]: progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so not with the four that we're
looking at, they were all moving in sync.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible they're being hydrolyzed
from starch reserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not look at starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only place that I know where
they could be coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question and a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hasn't been corrected for anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the investigation into the
responsiveness for hardiness, we just
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I'll be able to give you a
little bit more input on that after this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The samples that we're running include
both male and female vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you pointed out, our germplasm is
not run like a vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't control crop load.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't control vigor at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really I need to team up a little
bit more with a viticulturist who could
[SPEAKER_00]: give me a hand with understanding that we
could probably deploy some things with
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit removal in a vineyard setting and
see how that affects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I don't have the answer for
you though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason we kept them at five degrees
C is because that's the temperature of our
[SPEAKER_00]: cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the literature on chilling requirement
is the chilling portions that perennials
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to count begin below seven degrees C
and stop at zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep it in that sort of
sweet spot for chilling fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could definitely try treating at
zero over the longterm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to make sure that the plants
were acclimated sufficiently so they could
[SPEAKER_00]: be held below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry weight, just to give you some
background on the method there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we tried processing these buds fresh from
the LTE experiments and found that when we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to mechanically process them and
grind them up and they were wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we got less sugars extracted because
of the way that the grinding went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been freeze drying them in order
to make pulverization easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your point is good and it would be
easy enough for us to take fresh weights.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably pretty slight because these
buds are very tiny and they weigh very
[SPEAKER_00]: little to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes sense that if they're
increasing, they're osmolytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a very interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if rootstocks impact scion
hardiness, but if we need to try maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: graph the same scion onto a bunch of
different rootstocks and watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on what we expect the buds to be
going through in winter, they're more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less physiologically sealed off from the
cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they're responding on their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's true, then I guess you wouldn't
expect rootstock to contribute much,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for roots actually contributing
much through the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could definitely test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another trait we could be looking at
and having an impact on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't looked on it mostly because I
don't know a whole lot about wood
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology and I'm a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes sense that if you had a
greater capacity to transport
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates that perhaps you could
elevate that level prior to winter and
[SPEAKER_00]: start off at a heartier level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I would say is that we
expect that the buds are not drawing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cane tissue so much throughout the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they've shut down, the paradigm has
moved through the leaves of senesce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not expecting there to be a ton of
communication metabolically or molecularly
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping for the sooner rather than
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's so much the price
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's untangling how messed up the genetics
of grapevine actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the nephra, it's super
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are combinations that were formed a
long time ago and preserved in a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you compare between varieties,
we run into a lot of problems just mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: known genes because they move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inversions, deletions, this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we move to the wild species,
it just gets crazier from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that the whole GGRU group
is interested in pushing forward
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing in these wild species and we've
been working on it trying to get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild species as a reference genome so
that when we do those mapping populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be able to mark and map the
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we still lose a lot of
markers because there's no reference
[SPEAKER_00]: location for them in nephra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly hope it's in the next years or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the Iowa riparias in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one from Quebec in that study as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not south.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought our experiment wasn't working
when I got that data because the Manitoba
[SPEAKER_00]: riparia went so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have collaborators in South Dakota who
also work with this riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, riparia takes 1,500 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our experiment, it took nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our heads together and thinking
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to note is that there's chilling
going on before we get the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anywhere near 2,000 hours,
but every night it gets cold, that clock
[SPEAKER_00]: is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how your fall transition from
summer to winter is, how steep that
[SPEAKER_00]: transition is, that can really change what
that zero point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we came up with is in South Dakota
where you have a rapid transition,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hot, shortfall, deep into winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It counts a lot slower because it can only
count every time that comes back above
[SPEAKER_00]: zero, zero and seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot longer under that climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have a lot of cool nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts counting way before we can
actually go to dormant plasma and make
[SPEAKER_00]: dormant cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what our thought is with why
something so northern would appear to not
[SPEAKER_00]: need chilling at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really does need chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just starts that clock much earlier
than we are able to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we're counting chilling hours
prior to our zero point to see if that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes our scale at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it across a much wider swath.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to wait for the plants to go
dormant enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drop their leaves that can go out and
cut cuttings from our germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some riparias are very photorescent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would expect they would go dorm early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drop the clock early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if the photoreceptor clock is tied
into the cold clock in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some riparias are very photoresponsive and
they drop their leaves well in advance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others hang on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have that data from our
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this year's study, we expanded the
riparias to include ... We have one
[SPEAKER_00]: population from Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, excuse me, Texas and Iowa and
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to see things start to pull
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it this year too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Asian varieties, Amurensis,
burst very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all leafed out when we had that
scary frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viniferas were still quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see a lot of burning on the stuff
that burst in our germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you completely in that within
a vine, you could go out there and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like ... Here, it took out all six
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole vine over here is totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the next vine over, it's every
other bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of any reason that there
would be site-to-site location
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose there could be something along
the lines where certain buds incur a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-lethal amount of damage through the
winter, which makes them more susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to frost in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just weaker bursts.
[SPEAKER_00]: To us, they look fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think the microclimate is a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get an eddy or just a local drop of
a few percents of a degree, it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to cause that lethal symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to categorize it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ultimately what I would love to be
able to say I deployed was grapevines that
[SPEAKER_00]: have green shoots that come out in the
frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early spring, and it doesn't matter
what frost you get, they have a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to shrug it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to take a couple
more years though.
Let's thank Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
