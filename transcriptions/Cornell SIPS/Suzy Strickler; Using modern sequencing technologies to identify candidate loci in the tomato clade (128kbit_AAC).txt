[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so similar to last week's speaker,
the last time I was in this room,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually defending my PhD
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was talking, of course,
about mapping and Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'll be talking about
Arabidopsis mapping and tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: In full disclosure, I'm not actually a
plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a bioinformatician.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the projects that I work on
have direct application to useful
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, as Joyce mentioned,
I have a little bit of an heirloom tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: obsession.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is my rainbow of tomatoes from my
garden two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last summer wasn't so great because it's a
bit wet, and various disease problems
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: But two years ago, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be talking about tomato and also
closely related species today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this phylogeny, you can see what I'm
considering the members of the tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: clade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are 13 species in the tomato
clade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that one of them is actually
missing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll be focusing on these today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also Solanum likeopersicoides,
which you can see at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is also another species we'll be
talking about today, which is an outgroup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nice thing about these is that they
can actually be crossed with varying
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ones towards the bottom of the tree
tend to have self-ingratability and also
[SPEAKER_01]: unilateral incompatibility, which can be
can make it a bit more difficult to cross
[SPEAKER_01]: those to cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones towards the top of the trees tend
to be self-compatible.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mainly found in Western South
America, so Peru and Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the map here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can get this thing to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, and there's also two species that
are found in the Galapagos Islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit blurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Galapagency and cheese maniae,
which are found solely in the Galapagos
[SPEAKER_01]: Islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look kind of similar, the different
wild species of tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some of the diversity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Haberkites tends to have a lot of
trichomes, so it looks kind of fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in the middle here,
there are some seedlings that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the bottom, you can see Haberkites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reference tomato is Solanum
lycopersicum Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's growing in the middle of this
tray here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think this is really working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the top, we have
Pimpinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pimpinellifolium is pretty closely
related to the cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's variation in fruit
color and size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wild species tend to have smaller
fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also tend to ripen to green,
so they never actually change.
[SPEAKER_01]: They change to red, like your typical
garden tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the two species from the
Galapagos Islands, cheese maniae and
[SPEAKER_01]: Galapagency, that are orange-fruited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see here a number of fruit that we
got from Roger at TGRC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sent us some from their fruits that
they grow there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really nice for one of our
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the diversity in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some of our wild species growing in
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that they're indeterminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this sprawling phenotype,
as opposed to some of your more common
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated tomatoes, which are determinate
and don't get nearly as tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, you can cross the wild
species with cultivated tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this turns out to be really useful,
because cultivated tomato has undergone
[SPEAKER_01]: three bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was the original bottleneck that
happened during domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a second bottleneck happened when
they were transported to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a third bottleneck occurred when
they were transported back to the US for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's estimated something like 5% of the
diversity So there's a huge loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in the cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's nice is you can take the
wild species, which have a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and interesting traits,
and then you can cross these to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might think, so here's some more
of my tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think that they're looking at
that fruit shape, that there's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a diversity of phenotypes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually controlled by a few
loci.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few genes lead to sort of this
diversity of phenotypes that you see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wild species have been used in
breeding for a number of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been happening for the last
several decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can be used in breeding for
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see one of our collaborators on
a project is interested in tomato yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf coral virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has a cultivar that is resistant to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see in the bottom picture on
this line is called GH13.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants in the back are nice and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're resistant and the ones in the
foreground are not resistant to tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow leaf coral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'll also be talking about
bacterial specks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another trait that wild species
have been used to increase resistance to
[SPEAKER_01]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wild species can also be used in fruit
quality and nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some other things like leaf
morphology and flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'll be talking about some
different projects that we've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the common theme in all of these is
using bioinformatics approaches to map
[SPEAKER_01]: genes of interest in tomatoes and their
wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I'll talk about is
defining introgression boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this started originally as something
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first came to Lucas's lab as a
postdoc, we were handed the sequence from
[SPEAKER_01]: Galapagensis, the land of Galapagensi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was an interesting species,
because like I said, it came from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Galapagos Islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it evolved in relative isolation until
recently, except for a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: species that were found in the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very closely related to like a
persicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the work done at that time,
and even now it's a bit unclear where it
[SPEAKER_01]: falls on the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really sure why my picture is
so blurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Galapagensi actually falls here
with Cheesemanii, Pimpinella folium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and like a persicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little unclear how these species
are related whenever you do phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to do some work to try to
clarify that using the genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, since we knew that Heinz,
which is our reference genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: has Pimpinella folium in its parentage,
we also wanted to figure out where in the
[SPEAKER_01]: reference genome, Heinz, we could find
introgressions from Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to do that, we selected an old
heirloom line, yellow pear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see another one of my garden
pictures there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an old heirloom line that
existed prior to modern breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be free of introgression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was our control, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do this, we devised a pipeline that's
adapted from White et al, a paper that
[SPEAKER_01]: came out in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had five different species that we
looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the reference Heinz genome that
we used to map all of our resequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: data onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Galapagensi, Pimpinella folium
data that came from the tomato genome
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was publicly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our yellow pear resequencing data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, potato sequences
available at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mapped all these to Heinz,
the resequencing data to Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we created genomes from these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we substituted in the SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any place we had a gap, we masked
those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also then masked with repeat masker so
we could get rid of any repetitive regions
[SPEAKER_01]: that we couldn't be really sure where they
mapped to Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we did whole genome alignments with
these five species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran PALP to try to delimit where the
phylogenetic breakpoints were occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: along the alignment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then each one of these partitions,
we ran Mr. Bazon to determine a tree for
[SPEAKER_01]: that partition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all these trees were mapped back
onto the Heinz genome so that we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to see where a change in topology occurred
along the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In conjunction with that, we also plotted
the density of SNPs across the Heinz
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was resequencing data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used a standard SNP calling
pipeline, mapped the data called SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put these into bins of 10
kilobases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we plotted the density of SNPs
along the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can see at the top of the
diagram, or at the picture, we have Yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: Pear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second species is
Glepagensae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third is Panellifolium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at Yellow Pear,
where that red circle oval is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see there's sort of this little peak
and the SNP density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you come down to the last
plot, you see that there's a reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: SNP density there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a putative introgression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever we took that location and
then also used our data from the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: genome plot, we found that there was a
change in topology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would expect Heinz and Yellow Pear
to be clustered together in the tree,
[SPEAKER_01]: since they're actually both from
lycopersicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of the expected topology.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you move on to topology 2, you see that
it's flipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now Heinz is actually closer to pin 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is indicative of an introgression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you go outside that little
blip, you see it goes back to the original
[SPEAKER_01]: topology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by using this method, we were able to
find four regions in the Heinz reference
[SPEAKER_01]: genome where the introgressions have
occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one is on chromosome 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really sure what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just have been a happenstance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know of any known resistance
genes that are in that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: In chromosome 9, we have verticellium
genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to find introgressions
from pimpinellifolium that introduced
[SPEAKER_01]: those genes into Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the I gene for fusarium
wilt resistance on chromosome 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to delimit the
introgressions for each of these genes in
[SPEAKER_01]: Heinz, which now is really useful because
Heinz is our reference for the other
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be able to rule out these
introgressions that are occurring in our
[SPEAKER_01]: reference genome so that we don't think
that they're something of interest in the
[SPEAKER_01]: population that we're actually looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so now I'll talk a bit about mapping a
single gene using a mapping population
[SPEAKER_01]: with a close relative to Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was some work done by Sarah Hind
in Greg Martin's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really fortuitous because we
had just sequenced yellow pair and Sarah
[SPEAKER_01]: shows up in my office and says,
we just found this interesting phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: with yellow pair and I heard you have the
sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got off to a really good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the phenotype is that yellow pair
actually has reduced resistance to
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial infection, which you can see
here on the leaf on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see much more symptoms of speck
than on the leaves on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was great because we had the
sequence, so we can go ahead and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: find some candidate genes for this
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to remind you, again,
this tree is really blurry, but the two
[SPEAKER_01]: arrows are pointing to Lycopersicum and
Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are two very closely related
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the two species that were
used in the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LE1589 is Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the same accession that was
used in the tomato genome project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had sequence for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the yellow pair from our previous
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Sarah crossed these two to develop
the mapping population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she took a batch of susceptible
plants, which we used for the next step of
[SPEAKER_01]: the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an overview of the pipeline that
we used to identify the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing was to take those
susceptible plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sarah put them into batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were then sequenced on one lane
of Illumina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were mapped onto the yellow pair
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from our previous work in the
Galapagency project, we already had a
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow pair genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mapped these reads from her samples
onto yellow pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we called SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever we call SNPs, the SNPs that we
find should be coming from Pimpinella
[SPEAKER_01]: folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should be Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we plotted the frequency of these
across the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we had a region of interest,
then we went in to see what actual genes
[SPEAKER_01]: were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is from her paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the plotting of the SNP
frequency looked like from Pimpinella
[SPEAKER_01]: folium as we go across the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at, try to use this thing
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chromosome 4, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where my red dot was briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that there is a reduced
frequency of Pimpinella folium SNP and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dense frequency of the SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it drops off towards the beginning of
the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was our region of interest to try
to find the gene that's responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the really great thing about that was
that, as I said, we had the yellow pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went into that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked for any SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That were causing a change in the coding
sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we found is that there was one
gene in yellow pair that had some
[SPEAKER_01]: deletions that were causing a shift,
a frame shift in the coding sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was only happening in yellow
pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't happening in Pimpinella folium
or HINE or the other accessions that we
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a pretty good indication that
that was our gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed some markers and Sarah
went on to see to do some fine mapping to
[SPEAKER_01]: confirm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does turn out that that was the
actual gene conferring the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she went on to do a number of
very elegant experiments in the lab to
[SPEAKER_01]: elucidate what this gene is actually
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know more about that,
I'd highly recommend reading her paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing, another project,
is moving on to QTLs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we're mapping to an intermediate
relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not as close to cultivated tomatoes
from Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was some more work coming out of
Greg's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a former postdoc in his lab,
Zilong Bao, noticed that in this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular accession of Habrakites,
we have resistance to Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see in the leaf on the left,
looks nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see the really
susceptible one on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was also an intermediate
phenotype here, which you can see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, keep in mind, this is a little
bit more distant species that we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: in this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that's important to keep in
mind is that some of these issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: detecting recombination and then also
using high end of the reference genome
[SPEAKER_01]: gets a little bit more tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is from his paper, an overview of
how we did the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he mapped PtOS, which is essentially
cultivated tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two Habrakites developed an F1 and then an
F2 population.
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s were barcoded individually and then
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we aligned these to Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems we ran into is that
the read depth was a bit on the low side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to create a tool that would
actually create bins of genotypes as you
[SPEAKER_01]: go across the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since the SNP density was so low,
it was oftentimes difficult to accurately
[SPEAKER_01]: call heterozygous sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by taking an average across the bin,
we were able to determine what the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: consensus genotype should be for a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was how we handled the low
coverage data in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we took those average genotype
calls and went on to perform standard
[SPEAKER_01]: linkage analysis with our QTL.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in doing that, we found some,
we found a region on chromosome two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: region on chromosome eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The region on chromosome eight ended up
being basically the whole chromosome and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was very little recombination there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he decided to move forward with
chromosome two since it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went on, similar to Sarah's project,
to design some markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used the Habrakite sequence that we
had from the resequencing because there
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a Habrakite genome like there is for
Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we developed some markers based on
his sequence and then he was able to fine
[SPEAKER_01]: map to about a one megabase region on
chromosome two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a number of genes,
candidate genes, there that he did some
[SPEAKER_01]: further work on to look at expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit tricky though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this project was obviously more tricky
than the FLF3 project for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we're looking at a QTL so we
don't have the single strong effect locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, as I mentioned, it's a more
distant cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had this problem with reduced
recombination and some of the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also there isn't a Habrakites
reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you're doing something like
this, if you don't have a reference genome
[SPEAKER_01]: for both of the parents, you don't really
know what is in that segment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible that there could be genes
that are in there that aren't in Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these gene models we're predicting
from the Heinz annotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that oftentimes resistance
genes, they can be rapidly evolving and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can change by copy number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be of interest is to have a
Habrakites genome to see if those same
[SPEAKER_01]: genes are actually found in Habrakites in
that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a good experience for us to
give us sort of the rationale for having a
[SPEAKER_01]: reference genome for other projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of alluding to another project
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing now that we know that having a
reference genome for the more divergent
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato species is really helpful,
we moved on to a project with
[SPEAKER_01]: Lycopersicoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very divergent species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually an outgroup to the tomato
plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can still cross it with cultivated
tomato, but it's a bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was also another nice accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a postdoc, there still is a
postdoc, in Jim Givinoni's lab that was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing some work on the Lycopersicoides
introgression lines out in a field that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're currently using.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a couple years ago, and it was
really good conditions for spec that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our postdoc was interested in looking
at some fruit quality related things in
[SPEAKER_01]: the introgression lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since the conditions for spec were
really good, he was able to see that there
[SPEAKER_01]: were some plants that were actually
resistant to the spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's super interesting because it
has two really cool things going on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wrote a proposal to the Triad
Foundation that we have at BTI and
[SPEAKER_01]: rewarded a bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: To pursue this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here in the introgression
lines where they've found various loci
[SPEAKER_01]: that are involved either in the fruit
quality, so carotenoid biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: or pathogen resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the Triad, what we were able to do
is make the genome for Lycopersicoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to sequence it using our
funds, which is really great because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really helped a lot of our downstream
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we sequenced the genome
at about 80x coverage using PacBio
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we corrected those reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not familiar with PacBio,
it has a very, very high error rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing you need to do with it
is map the reads to the longest,
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly 20% of the reads, and then correct
those reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you use for assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried two different assembly tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Falcon is known as the diploid
assembler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also tried Canu, which is a
modified version of Solera assembler
[SPEAKER_01]: that's used for PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ran two different assemblies,
actually many different assemblies using
[SPEAKER_01]: two different tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found, based on N50 values,
average length, the resulting assembly
[SPEAKER_01]: size, that the Canu assembly was the
better one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we move forward with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did polishing using both the PacBio
reads and then also we had Illumina reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mapped all those onto our genome and
tried to remove as much of the error as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible because PacBio often will leave
indels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, obviously, you don't want to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took that polished assembly
and we used that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sent that off to Dovetail to do Hi-C
and also their Chicago libraries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was magical because whenever we
got that back, it was chromosome length
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically have our assembly in 12
pseudomolecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we got that back, then we just did a
little bit more work to fill in gaps
[SPEAKER_01]: because the Hi-C will create gaps in the
genome, which are just ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take your PacBio reads and,
again, map them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you can span those gaps and
fill in the missing sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what our assemblies are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they're looking like so far
compared to the published Peneliai and the
[SPEAKER_01]: published Lycopersicum genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that the Hi-C did a great
job because we didn't have really any good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic maps to use for Lycopersicoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Hi-C was able to pull in all of
these scaffolds and get our genome
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly up to pseudomolecule level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longest sequence in Lycopersicoides is
133 megabases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically a whole chromosome,
which is really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contic size is huge, which is,
again, good because we want to predict
[SPEAKER_01]: gene models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have really long stretches
of continuous sequence, you're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to predict your gene
models very accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the total length is comparable to what
we expect the genome size to be for
[SPEAKER_01]: Lycopersicoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pretty happy with our results for
this genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of a standard analysis that's
done with genome assemblies and also
[SPEAKER_01]: annotations to give you an idea of how
complete your genome assembly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are genes, Busco, or a set of
genes that should be universally
[SPEAKER_01]: conserved, and they should be present in
single copy in the plant lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look for these in your genome to
see how many of them you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see, so LA2951, that's
Lycopersicoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that we have very,
very few missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have fewer missing than if you
run the same analysis on tomato 2.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really statistically
significant, but it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these three other assemblies in
blue are other packed bioassemblies we did
[SPEAKER_01]: with coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have those there as a basis of
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, things are looking really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a bit of a higher duplication
level in Lycopersicoides of the Busco set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find that if I remove, so whenever
you do the HI-C, you get your
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudomolecules, and then you get some
other sort of contigs that weren't pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I remove those, that number drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of that stuff that
didn't get pulled in is actually another
[SPEAKER_01]: haplotype that was assembled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's also probably
chloroplast in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be what would be causing
this duplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Lycopersicoides is very
heterozygous, so we would expect that
[SPEAKER_01]: there would be some cases where the two
haplotypes didn't get merged together in
[SPEAKER_01]: the assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, what people really care
about with genome assemblies is finding
[SPEAKER_01]: the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next step was to run software
called Maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Maker works by, first you repeat-mass
the genome because it's you leave the
[SPEAKER_01]: repeats in there, it confuses the gene
prediction software.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you repeat mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you train some ab initio gene
predictors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used Augustus and SNAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you train those with a training set so
that you have a model for what the genes
[SPEAKER_01]: should look like for the particular
species that you're annotating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put all this into Maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also give it EST, RNA-seq data,
all kinds of expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And data basically, you feed that into
Maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will give you a bunch of
predicted gene models that are never 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're a good starting point of where
coding regions should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we did that, we got about almost
38,000 gene models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is comparable to what you see in
Penelia and Lycopersicom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we tried to do functional
prediction with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are they likely to encode?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used this using BLAST sequence
similarity and then also interpro scan,
[SPEAKER_01]: which looks for domains in the protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a nifty little tool that we're
really trying to encourage people to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said with the annotation,
you never have things 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one way of helping with that is to set
up these instances of Web Apollo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so users can come in and actually edit
their gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what this is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, what you have are your gene
model up at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the predicted gene model for Maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have tracks below that show
all of your RNA-seq data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had ISO-seq here.
[SPEAKER_01]: ISO-seq is sequence that comes from PacBio
sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's nice about it is it should,
in most cases, give you a full length
[SPEAKER_01]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are really good for annotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have RNA-seq from different tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you need is an account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this set up for cultivated
tomato, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of you are working on that and are
interested in particular genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can contact us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can set you up with an account.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in and actually change gene
models and correct them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this goes into a database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whenever we release the next
version of the annotation, all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: changes will be incorporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought I'd throw this out
there in case any of you are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: mycopersicoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be making this publicly available
in the next week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be pre-publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be free for anyone to use as long
as you agree to our access agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be on soulgenomics.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can let me know if you're
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we have this genome,
we want to move forward with the projects
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at these genes that are involved
in disease resistance and fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed a pipeline for predicting
or creating markers to map traits in these
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since likeopersicoides and
likeopersicum are so divergent,
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes it's difficult to get enough
recombination if you generate enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually map genes very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that was done was to
cross likeopersicoides to pineal AI,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually get more recombination
and find that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of this, we made the pipeline
so that it would give us markers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: for use in crosses between
likeopersicoides and pineal AI and crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: between likeopersicoides and Heinz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mapped likeopersicoides to the
published pineal AI genome and to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Heinz genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we used Mummer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took those results and we
identified any region where we had an
[SPEAKER_01]: indel that was greater than 30 base pairs,
but less than 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those parameters can be tweaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we used Primer 3 just to design
primers on either side of that indel that
[SPEAKER_01]: we could use to distinguish differences in
the F2 population to use as markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to confirm that these would actually
work in PCR, then we took them and we
[SPEAKER_01]: blasted them back to the respective
genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because since the genomes are quite
different, sometimes the primers wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: match 100% or sometimes they would map too
far apart or do something unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to do that last step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in doing that, for likeopersicoides
and pineal AI, we have about 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for likeopersicoides and
likeopersicum, we got about 600 markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason there's less for
likeopersicoides and likeopersicum is
[SPEAKER_01]: because, again, they're more divergent,
so less things aligned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also when we would blast the
primers back, since we were predicting
[SPEAKER_01]: them on one genome, oftentimes those
primers wouldn't match 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some tweaks we can make to
the pipeline to pull out a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: markers if we needed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the last mapping approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a work in progress as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a collaboration with Greg
Martin's lab is to see how we can use GWAS
[SPEAKER_01]: and TOMATO to look at novel disease
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this, there is a lot of data that's
publicly available for various TOMATO
[SPEAKER_01]: lines and also wild species and
pimpinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've taken advantage of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a paper where they see plants
360 lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those were likeopersicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another data set of about 100
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those include wild species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have snipship data and
some other things that were just put into
[SPEAKER_01]: the SRA at NCBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took all of this data and we
generated this big tree from all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't that tree, but it kind of
gives you the idea of this is a subset of
[SPEAKER_01]: those accessions, which is a little bit
easier for presentation purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it gives you some idea of how things
sort of fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's how you would expect
likeopersicums clustered together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have your land races down here by
the star and heirloom lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue is serraciforme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So serraciforme is generally believed to
be admixture between pimpinellifolium and
[SPEAKER_01]: likeopersicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the green at the top, we have
pimpinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the yellow is some more divergent
wild species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was useful because now we can
select from these clusters
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: To use for screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to get a broad picture of the
diversity that's present in tomato based
[SPEAKER_01]: on this work with the resequencing data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sarah Hein, who was a postdoc in Greg's
lab, and Samantha have worked to select
[SPEAKER_01]: samples from this tree and then to procure
seed for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think right now in Sammy's office,
they're running like a whole germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: storage center.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of seed from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Robin and Holly, also in Greg's
lab, are involved in screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're screening for novel phenotypes,
pathogen phenotypes of Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: responses to Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really nice is that since we
have all the sequence data and now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting these phenotypes to tie in with
it, we can try to use GWAS to get at the
[SPEAKER_01]: low side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're causing these interesting
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some work done by Adrian
Powell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been using, so the first thing
that he tried to do was we know FLS3 is
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in pathogen response.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a sequence from a number of
individuals who are non-responders,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more who are responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking all the sequence data,
and the phenotypes that we already have,
[SPEAKER_01]: he did some work to see if we could
actually detect the known gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell from the Manhattan plot,
he was able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a bit of noise, but you see this
nice strong peak on chromosome 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you zoom in to where that is
occurring, that actually is at the FLS3
[SPEAKER_01]: locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, Adrian's working on fine
tuning this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he'll be interested in applying
this to the new phenotypes that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing I wanted to talk about
briefly is a little bit of advertising for
[SPEAKER_01]: one of our group members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wrote this program called
SNP-BINNER.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is useful for the creation of BIN
maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have GBS data or RNA-seq data
and you generate a lot of SNPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes that can be a bit too much
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So BIN maps are a way of sort of reducing
the complexity of that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing it does is,
so in this case, it's been tested with
[SPEAKER_01]: RILs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes each line and it looks for the
crossover points in each line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then based on an algorithm,
it takes those crossover points and
[SPEAKER_01]: constructs a BIN map from that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the other thing about it,
there are some other tools that do some
[SPEAKER_01]: similar things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one, if you have a VCFL,
it basically will take VCFL from any SNP
[SPEAKER_01]: caller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a little overview of
basically how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the top, we have the RILs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, it does a step that I'm not
showing here where it uses some hidden
[SPEAKER_01]: Markov models.
[SPEAKER_01]: To identify the genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So genotype calling can be messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does some work to sort of smooth
those out and determine the recombination
[SPEAKER_01]: breakpoints, which you can see at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it uses an algorithm to take
those recombination maps and collapse them
[SPEAKER_01]: into a BIN map, which can then be used in
QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has actually been used in a paper
that we hope will be coming out soon by
[SPEAKER_01]: Itai Gonda and Jim Jibunoni's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he used SNP in his analysis of some
fruit quality traits in a Pimpenelifolium
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato RIL population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, if you really want to
play with the tool, it is publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: available on GitHub.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go there and try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, we've only used it on RILs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that Itai has been testing
it out on an F2 population, actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: F2 population from the Hebrokites project
that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in using it on F2,
we can touch base with him and see how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's working with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nearing the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, I work as a
bioinformatician.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very, very just absolutely
thrilled that I get to work with all these
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful people in molecular labs that
are willing to share their data with us
[SPEAKER_01]: and let us mine their data for exciting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you probably noticed, a lot of this
work was done in conjunction with Greg
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So specifically, I'd like to thank Zilong
Bao, who was the lead on the Hebrokites
[SPEAKER_01]: project, Sarah Hind, who was the lead on
the FLS3 project, Samantha, who's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the work with the mapping of the Leica
persicoides genes, and then also Robin and
[SPEAKER_01]: Holly, who are doing this big screen and
working with Adrian, the GWAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Givinoni lab specifically,
I'd like to thank Ari, who's done a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the RNA sequencing for our Leica
persicoides genome, which allowed us to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene model prediction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Itai, who worked with David on the SNPBINR
project, and Yumen, who is awesome at RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction and gave us really high quality
RNA sequence for our iso-seq sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: for the annotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the Mueller lab, who is always
extremely helpful and obviously has spent
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of time there, and the Glapagenzy
work was done while I was a postdoc in his
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our collaborator, Buring-Usadel,
and specifically Alessandra in his lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: who has helped with the Leica persicoides
genome project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roger at TGRC, who always is sending a
seed and things that we need to get our
[SPEAKER_01]: work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the BCBC group, which,
as Joyce mentioned, is newly formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: David, who wrote the SNPBINR software,
and Adrian, who is doing GWAS analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst many, many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's David's in the left corner there
and Adrian's on the right, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some weirdo photobombing in the
middle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really exciting day for us
because this is when we got our first BCBC
[SPEAKER_01]: server.
[SPEAKER_01]: That empty slot that we're peering into is
where our new one terabyte memory server
[SPEAKER_01]: is currently residing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working very, very hard on assembling
a milkweed genome for George Jander right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, of course, money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good that people give us money to do
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge thanks to VTI who supported a number
of the things that the BCBC group is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NSF that occasionally does hand out
money, and the Triad Foundation for a
[SPEAKER_01]: Persequoides project.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing, one last advertisement.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any of the grad students and
post-docs, or really anyone, if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested or want to know more about
bioinformatics or have a problem with your
[SPEAKER_01]: project, we run this bioinformatics hour
at VTI on Wednesdays one to two and
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursdays 10 to 11 in the resource center
where the fish tank is, but I hear it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to stop by during those times,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come and talk to us and maybe we
can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we'll be starting the VTI
bioinformatics course on March 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the topics that we'll be
covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those are things that are useful to you
that you'd like to know more about,
[SPEAKER_01]: just send me an email and I can let you
know the schedule and sign you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the GWAS that I mentioned,
that particular, that was just looking
[SPEAKER_01]: within a persicum.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not saying you're going to try
to do GWAS within that goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Adrian, who is sitting behind you,
and he can correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think we're trying to stick to a
persicum because whenever you add
[SPEAKER_01]: pimpinella folium, then there's structure
issues and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's thank Susie again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
