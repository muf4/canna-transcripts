[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to my talk about weeds and weed
management and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Lynn Sosnowski, and I'm an
assistant professor of weed biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology, and management and specialty
crops here at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds in any cropping system compete with
the crop for water, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and light, and that can directly impact
yield, quantity, and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds that become established in crops can
alter the microclimate around the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can then impact disease development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weeds can actually serve as alternate
hosts for both pests and pathogens in
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetation that isn't controlled can
reduce the final harvestability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the absence of any kind of vegetation
control chemicals in the hemp crop itself
[SPEAKER_00]: may necessitate the use of multiple and
integrated practices to suppress weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that become established.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to integrated weed management
in hemp, the first step should always be
[SPEAKER_00]: proper site selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means avoiding fields with
perennials or extremely high weed
[SPEAKER_00]: densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to start clean,
make sure to try and stay clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always manage and harvest your cleanest
fields first.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to planting date,
you might be able to plant and get ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if the field that you're
planting into has a lot of summer emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: weed species, choose an earlier planting
date that allows your crop to get up and
[SPEAKER_00]: gives it some kind of competitive
advantage against the vegetation it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be competing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a stale seedbed technique where you
stimulate the germination of weeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then eliminate emerged seedlings both
physically and chemically can be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: useful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But understand that not all weeds are
going to respond equally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species with non-dormant seeds might be
better controlled under this strategy as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to species with dormant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you have the best planting
conditions that you can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, making sure you have a nice
even seedbed so that you have good soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: seed contact for even germination,
which will improve the crop's competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you plant with appropriate
densities to minimize that open space that
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds can then colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using transplants, this can be a
really useful strategy to give your crop a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive size advantage over the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choosing varieties can have an influence
on how competitive the crop is as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the heights and the branching
traits that that variety possesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be cultivating,
make sure you keep your rows as straight
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible to maximize cultivation
performance and get the weeds while they
[SPEAKER_00]: are small, either at the white thread or
the early seedling stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using plastic mulch,
remember that this is still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: require weeding between beds and removing
weeds that emerge through the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though herbicides aren't available
for you, if you're using hemp directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're likely to be used in crops that
are planted before hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to pay attention to this
because these products have rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on the label and hemp may not
be explicitly listed, but the term other
[SPEAKER_00]: crop often is, and hemp is going to fall
into that other crop category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in understanding
the type of plant back restrictions that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be encountered in industrial hemp
production, I suggest doing a Google
[SPEAKER_00]: search for the terms Wisconsin hemp and
rotation restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're really likely to find this nice
handout that was produced by UW Madison,
[SPEAKER_00]: which explicitly looks at the restrictions
that are associated with the herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: that are used in pre-seeding crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the rotation
restrictions that my colleagues at UW
[SPEAKER_00]: Madison found across multiple herbicide
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they're extremely varied
in the amount of time that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait before you can plant industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, for the Fusilade and
SelectMax labels, there was a one month
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: For something like Pursuit and Mesethopyr,
there was a 40 month rotation restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now understand the list is not inclusive
and labels can and do change and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: your responsibility to always consult the
labels before making any herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: application and before planting crops
following herbicide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we don't have herbicides
currently labeled for use in hemp doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that we aren't looking to see how
herbicides affect hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of herbicide trials that are
currently underway in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're being undertaken for multiple
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of which is to identify active
ingredients that will be safe to use in
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and to address pest management needs
in the US hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second reason is to identify
herbicides that will be able to control
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp escapes that occur in following
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third reason is to characterize
herbicide symptomology in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide carryover or drift injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's considerable interest in
conducting hemp herbicide trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: very few have actually made it to formal
publication stage yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one exception being some work that's
been recently undertaken by Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Flesner's group at Virginia Tech
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really good paper where they
evaluated herbicide tolerance of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp in both greenhouse and
field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective of the research that was
conducted in Michael Flesner's lab was to
[SPEAKER_00]: test hemp tolerance to both pre-emergence
and post-emergence herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say pre-emergence herbicides,
we're talking soil applied herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking post-emergence,
we're talking foliar applied herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did conduct this across years and
they did do the studies in both greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and in field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they saw was variability across
time and between growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although with respect to the results,
they did find that esmatolechlor was the
[SPEAKER_00]: least injurious of the soil applied
herbicides in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although their greenhouse trials did
suggest that other active ingredients may
[SPEAKER_00]: have potential for future research.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the foliar applied
herbicides, quazalephop and sethoxidin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are both grass herbicides,
were found to be the least injurious of
[SPEAKER_00]: the post-products along with clopyrrolid
and bromoxanil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like you to know that we're also
conducting herbicide trials here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Agritech.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the results from a preliminary
screening project that we've started to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the safety of post-emergence or
foliar applied herbicides on industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that our results largely
agree with those that were achieved by
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Flesner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily, if we're looking at percent
injury, the post-emergence herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in our trial providing the least
amount of injury to hemp are clathidin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a WSSA1 herbicide, clopyramide
and bromoxanil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plan to continue these herbicide
screens both in the greenhouse and under
[SPEAKER_00]: field conditions this fall and in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: The previous slide showed you our
post-emergence herbicides that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a suite of pre-emergence
herbicides that we'll be evaluating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we'll be doing it in both the
greenhouse and field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to have some trials describing the
impacts of herbicide carryover and drift
[SPEAKER_00]: on crop growth and yield development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also hoping to look at the biology
of hemp and evaluate its competitiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: with both current weed issues such as
velvet leaf, foxtail bindweed and
[SPEAKER_00]: nightshade and up and coming problems in
New York, such as Palmer amaranth and
[SPEAKER_00]: water hemp.
