[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't going to

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just coming in for a quickie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to release this on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very welcome for a Thursday bonus
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get to the main topic,
I want to do a little bit of bragging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Organtica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organtica is a medical marijuana
dispensary in the state of New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are located in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in Albuquerque or a New Mexico
medical marijuana patient, be sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: visit my friends at Organtica because I
bred a strain called Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise is golden goat to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys at Organtica got some seeds and
they grew the Arise and the Arise has been
[SPEAKER_02]: testing consistently in the high 20s to
low 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their most recent test tested at 32% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 35.84% THCA and 32% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tested by my friends at Steep Hill
Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations and big shout out and much
thanks and much love to everybody at
[SPEAKER_02]: Organtica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I've got a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I hold the highest THCA test at
Steep Hill Labs with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not grow it, but I bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means there's a lot of potential in the
Arise and a lot of potential in the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains I crossed with the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to everybody there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, shout out to my friends at Handmade

Apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to keep this episode short,
I need to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to quit bragging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move into the main topic of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is about something called
Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as
[SPEAKER_02]: SADD, also known as Winter Depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about winter depression and
feeling sad and ways that some cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: may help us out with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I want to come up with a podcast
about SADDs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because lately, I have felt this funk in
my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blaming it on this weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a California person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up right near the beach,
boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was fucking stupid,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's okay because I meant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seriously from the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up 20 minutes from the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go to Bolsa Chica Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go to Huntington Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go to Seal Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be all over the beach,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lifeguard Stand 23 at Bolsa Chica Beach
used to be the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the waves are ripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the kids could go do whatever
we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the... I was a young kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the older kids could go smoke
some dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: The even older kids would drink beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gave a shit what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a beach kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss that constant sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss just that vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Colorado now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In about October, November, it gets
fucking cold and it gets really dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: The days get really short, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the days didn't get as short
in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the winter comes, the days feel
shorter in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just could be me being older and not
being a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's fucking with my head,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: These dark, cold winter months,
you can't go outside and do what you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: normally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get up early for work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to defrost the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Rogan put it best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Rogan said there are states that are
called... He calls them the fuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: States because when you get in your car to
go to work in the morning, you spend three
[SPEAKER_02]: or four minutes sitting there going fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, because you're so
[SPEAKER_02]: cold, your body can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stomach muscles tighten up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brain starts twitching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your neck gets all stiff and you just got
to wait for the car to defrost and so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could drive to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snow drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels to make me... It seems to feel
like it makes me weak and slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes my bones and muscles hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not enjoying the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let it slow me down, but I do feel
it in the back of my head going,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, something sucks and it's just this
seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about a couple of things
that winter depression comes along with
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we'll move into the cannabis part
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it usually lasts from fall to
springish.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're feeling a little funky from fall
to spring, this is probably why,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you live in these winter
colder climates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some symptoms of this seasonal effective
disorder include depression, just basic
[SPEAKER_02]: depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your classic depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are feeling like hurting yourself
or somebody else or if you've got problems
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, if you're thinking about
starting to drink alcohol or take pills or
[SPEAKER_02]: hurt yourself or cut yourself or break
something or be an asshole to people,
[SPEAKER_02]: please get some help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to judge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to hate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to treat you right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to hurt yourself, if you want
to kill yourself, please call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking send me a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call Suicide Prevention Hotline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably don't know each other too
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're embarrassed to call somebody,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't broadcast your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about why you want to hurt
yourself and we'll fix that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't need to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're really depressed,
please get some help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think you've got some winter
seasonal depression, we can help you with
[SPEAKER_02]: some cannabis suggestions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another symptom here would be some
laziness, just low energy, lethargy,
[SPEAKER_02]: no desire to get out of bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to lay around, put some
blankets over you, maybe play on your
[SPEAKER_02]: phone and not do a damn thing,
losing interest in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of an effect of the winter
depression here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have no desire to eat when
this winter depression comes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But oddly enough, the internet says that
people will seek foods like carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_02]: and such during the winter, which is odd
for me because I always like carbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like pizza and pasta and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it says that you're going to seek out
carbohydrate type salty foods if you are
[SPEAKER_02]: experiencing seasonal effectiveness
disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says you're going to be agitated and
irritable, which I am there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's partly how I'm noticing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel more tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel grouchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel fucking annoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty sure that it's mostly just
this seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that the internet said that
I totally relate to, and this is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what inspired me to want to talk about
this because it's part of where we are in
[SPEAKER_02]: this new generation, this new part of
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that this seasonal effectiveness
disorder comes with panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a reason for these
panic attacks that we're getting now as
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are too attached to our computers and
our devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as humans, we have become completely
lazy and complacent.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the winter, I think that there's
something inside of me that gives me this
[SPEAKER_02]: trigger to go hunt and gather food and
build a fire so that I can keep the family
[SPEAKER_02]: warm through the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we all have jobs that don't
require, most of us have jobs that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: require that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in a grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I show up at a grow at six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave there at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play on my computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: My food all comes from a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as humans, we were supposed
to, we were designed and built to be out
[SPEAKER_02]: there hunting our food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be, I should be out there
chasing down deer or buffalo and killing
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit and dragging it in and then
scanning it and cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am a vegetarian and I'm saying
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of why I think humans are
fucked up because we're not doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something primal in us that makes
us supposed to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the winter, that primal instinct to
survive becomes even stronger because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: harder to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the environment where I am,
it's even harder because it snows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that I'm in the worst
conditions, but I mean, we get snow and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have shelter and food and
warmth, you will die out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our inside, our instinct, our natural
design is to be hunting and gathering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're supposed to be using energy and
adrenaline and that anger that you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't feel that if you were
throwing a spear at another animal so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have time to be angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have time to be depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be letting out all that anger
through adrenaline, through hiking,
[SPEAKER_02]: through stalking an animal, through,
or maybe through gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were a vegetarian back in the
whatever times I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you had to spend all of that energy
in the garden and we're not doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting on computers and we're
playing video games and we're driving up
[SPEAKER_02]: to a window to get our food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of that is kind of what's
causing the winter depression for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if this affects women the
same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to be sexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know it's a testosterone thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe women want to be hunters and
gatherers also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe women suffer the seasonal
effectiveness disorder for the same
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, but differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure this part is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The panic attacks and the hunting rant is
all my own opinion here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we should be using our energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna start talking about now
about things that we can do to help
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves with this seasonal effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already talked about being active,
exercise, get out there and do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hypothetically saying I feel like we
should be hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be chasing down an elk or a
deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got to kill it with either a
spear or a bow and arrow, a recurve bow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to go drag that shit back to
camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got to skin it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get everything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being around a fire makes me feel
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a campfire, something inside of a
campfire really fixes me, especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: this cold weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get out there and be active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build a campfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go camping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go hunting if you're that type of person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I can really recommend to get
you out of a seasonal effective disorder
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a funk is join some sort of
organized martial art or fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of what's causing this is
pent up body energy from the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get out there and use your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go join a Brazilian jujitsu class.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go join a martial arts class.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go be a wrestler.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not into that, go do some yoga.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use some energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll really help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now let's start talking about before I
get to smoking cannabis, I want to say go
[SPEAKER_02]: for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put on some music and go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always fixes my head when I'm a
little bit funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on your favorite music, some reggae,
whatever you're into.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into some metal, put on some
metal, turn it up a little bit too loud
[SPEAKER_02]: and just go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll fix your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to say go for a drive before
I start talking about consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because Michael flip out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I say smoke a joint, go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now let's talk about other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how cannabis can truly help with
the seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that smoking sativa dominant
cannabis, either flowers or dabs are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to help fix your mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a short list of strains here that
I have experimented with personally that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have found to help uplift my mood and not
make me too anxious or jittery and still
[SPEAKER_02]: allow me to function and get my job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still be like a normal person would
still have a nice buzz and nobody could
[SPEAKER_02]: tell how high I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this list, number one on this list
is jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly bean has always put me in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me walk with a nice little pep in
my step.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts a grin on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly bean will wipe out any anxiety,
depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll calm me down and put you in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one on that list is tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a lot of people are going to say
jelly bean and tangy are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very similar strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very similar quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: They taste very similarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow similarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they both put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next strain on my list is tangerine
haze from Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually Soma's New York City
Diesel, but there is a phenotype that
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes very tangerine and orangey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tangerine haze is always been,
I used to call it my morning breakfast
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, I need my morning oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would smoke some Soma's tangerine
haze or is New York City Diesel known as
[SPEAKER_02]: tangerine haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a group back in the day known
as the Devil's Harvest crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grew a bunch of stuff and they
found a very orangey phenotype,
[SPEAKER_02]: very orangey phenotype of the New York
City Soma's Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they passed that around and called it
tangerine haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it got the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found the same phenotype out of a
pack and I grew it and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always used to put a smile on my
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think those top three that I listed
are very orangey, very citrusy,
[SPEAKER_02]: very sativa, yet very light strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you smoke them, when I smoke them,
I don't get super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get high as fuck off of either of
those three strains, but I can catch a
[SPEAKER_02]: really killer smiley buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something in that orange turp is really
helping you fix your mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next strain on my list, you guys,
is Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Brothers Grimm Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy 99 has always given me a nice smiley
cerebral uplifting buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a mood changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you a little shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's available again in seed form
from our friends at Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can possibly pick that up at
thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that's always uplifting and
puts me in a good mood, but is sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: too much for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one may give you a little panicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a little jittery and too much
sativa, this may be a little too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the Jack Herr has always been a good
strain for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes my mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps me upbeat and it makes me social,
but it can drive your head a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're somebody that gets too talkative
when you smoke too much cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack may not be the cross for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to get social, if you're going
somewhere and you're like, I got to go
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to people, maybe some Jack will be
the one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another strain that is always uplifting
and puts people in a good mood,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you guys are going to be surprised
that I say this because I've made plenty
[SPEAKER_02]: of jokes about it, but Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream is always a good strain for
putting you in a good mood, for changing
[SPEAKER_02]: your vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one of those strains that makes
you want to curl up into a ball when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get too high because I've seen people want
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get too high from Blue Dream and
it's a nice mellow buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I make fun of Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it stripper weed because that's how
high strippers want to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strippers don't want to get fucking high
as fuck like I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strippers just want to get a little buzz
and go spin on the pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking, but that's why I call it
stripper weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically any kind of a haze cross,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of what I've mentioned has a haze in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herr and Jack the Ripper have a lot
of the same parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack the Ripper is a cross of Jack Herr.
[SPEAKER_02]: I strongly recommend some Jack the Ripper,
but like I said about the Herr,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be a bit much for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could make some people's head spin if
you're not an experienced smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trying to beat seasonal
effectiveness disorder and you are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a strong heavy sativa dose and you
like to get kind of whirlwind high,
[SPEAKER_02]: grab yourself some Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available at a lot of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great tasting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a great high to it and it's usually
pretty easy to find because Subcool is a
[SPEAKER_02]: very popular breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're talking about Subcool,
I'm going to mention Vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get some Vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wax, but it was a different texture
of wax from a dispensary in Denver and I
[SPEAKER_02]: loved the high from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave me tunnel vision high to where I
couldn't pay attention to anything except
[SPEAKER_02]: what was right in front of me,
but it also put the stupidest smile on my
[SPEAKER_02]: face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really loved the way that Vortex made me
feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Vortex, if you are not an
experienced, Vortex made my heart race.
[SPEAKER_02]: My heart was going, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about being too high
like that that I really, really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another strain that is good for the
seasonal effective disorder is the lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's golden goat cross two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually lemon skunk crossed a golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of my favorites to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been tested in the 30% range for
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely a head changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about the orange and lemon
turps, the limonene turps really create
[SPEAKER_02]: like a good mood, a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think things that smell like oranges,
smell like fruit, smell like lemons,
[SPEAKER_02]: are usually going to be uplifting positive
vibe kind of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of the haze crosses and the
tangy and jelly bean crosses are usually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be good to put you into a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are strains that I can recommend
for smoking if they are available where
[SPEAKER_02]: you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If smoking isn't something for you and if
you're not getting the desired effect from
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking, edibles may be a better route to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Body chemistry is all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trying to fight depression or
seasonal effective depression,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you need high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you need CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would kind of stay away from the
indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens to me, and I have to go in
history because now I smoke so much and my
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance is so high and I'm older and I'm
more used to being high out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was younger and was new at
cannabis, when I would smoke sativas,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get that real psychedelic high and
get talkative sort of like I am now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just fucking rambling and talking
about everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when I would smoke indicas,
I would go in my head and get quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you just sit in a chair and
you start thinking too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you could drive yourself crazy
thinking too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're already in the seasonal
effectiveness disorder head state,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking an indica that's going to put you
into your own head and make you think may
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck you up a little more than you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause more depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause self-doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be the thing that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would go for some sativa edibles or
CBD edibles, but I would definitely stay
[SPEAKER_02]: away from the indica dominant stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I think the most reliable cure
for seasonal effective disorder is to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a joint and go for a hike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a nice safe hiking spot, roll
yourself up a nice joint of your favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, either the jilly bean or some
lemon Jeffrey or whatever you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: that fits in the list that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself a nice sativa joint,
roll it up, take one of your best friends
[SPEAKER_02]: with you, take your dog with you,
get a bottle of water, go for a walk,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a joint and fix your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, you guys, it's okay to
feel this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to deal with some shit
in their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right to feel kind of funky once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to deal with it properly and pull
yourself through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully when the spring comes,
you'll start cheering up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully by the time 420 rolls around,
you'll be in a good mood and then summer's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back and then it's time to get in a
good mood again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can figure it out and not go
through it again next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, that was my quick
talk on seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I was helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I could guide you in the right way
to select cannabis to keep you in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, even if you're not suffering through
some seasonal depression, all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains will probably put a smile on your
face, keep you social.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to go to lunch with somebody
you don't really care to go to lunch with,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got to do a chore you don't
really give a shit to do, try smoking one
[SPEAKER_02]: of these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might put you in a better mood for
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I want to thank
everybody for listening to a short
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
