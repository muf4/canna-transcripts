[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 367 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by letting
you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Screamin'
Watermelon from Viola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when my guest showed up, we took a few
dabs of the Copper Chem from Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already hinted that this episode will
have a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you are looking forward to
the Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you that the next episode,
we will get back on the Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was available to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse was available to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like having great guests on the show,
even if it does kind of disrupt the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you guys will enjoy this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's welcome Jesse to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, welcome back to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking time out of your busy
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about, I think you said
you had a staff of 15 people you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge of now?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still a busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming and hanging out,
taking time out of the day, out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting cold, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you running outdoor grows in this
cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most challenging part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the place I work at, it's a
greenhouse, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a roof and some walls on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is here because a lot of people on
social media have been asking him to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back on the show and talk about no-till
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to jump right into it,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, maybe we should explain what
no-till is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about maybe what no-till is and
how it varies from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional methods that I talk about and
how most people are taught how to,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: How most people are taught to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taught if they're on a farm or if
they live in that way, they were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: taught no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-till in the cannabis industry,
that term gets confused so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a big misunderstanding about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-till in real big ag is completely
different practices than raised beds and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to knock what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a misunderstanding of the term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also permaculture, that's one that gets
... I see permaculture get just tagged on
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of stuff that isn't
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for a while I was using
permaculture wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Tad Hussey is the only person that
actually understands what permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows what it is for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a design plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to work a piece of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really something you're going to
pull off in your basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole farming practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farming chessboard essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slightly understand it from because of
Tad, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets misconfused a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Misconfused, is that a word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was perfect English for you.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is a no-till bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are chiming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my people, they listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have taught them to grow with bottled
nutrients because that's what I'm mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to tell them what no-till is and
how it's different from growing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I see, mostly in cannabis,
a no-till cannabis bed seems to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: raised bed with a large amount of soil in
it that is good amended organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome what it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilling's not really something I think a
lot of pot growers actually do with their
[SPEAKER_01]: rototiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a pot grower's version of tilling
is to dump it out and buy new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find somewhere to get rid of all of this
and then buy brand new at the store is our
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me and what I see, it means that
they're reusing their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing things to build soil,
to protect it with cover crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: chop and drop, having worms in there,
eating stuff, all kinds of biology in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, not feeding it bottled nutrients and
top dressing with amendments, feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I see no-till as.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a good start of places to
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it all starts with our
no-till bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we also do this in large pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem to recommend the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be what you talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be what the people on
Instagram are asking about too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larger amount of soil you can work
with, the better it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to create life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more space for more life,
the more stuff, the more activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more space, the more life.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you could even apply these
practices directly to the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: in ground planted stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that's where you're going to
make the most impact as far as restoring
[SPEAKER_01]: soil in this earth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long term sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebuilding top soil and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of the world scenario, this would be
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem like the type of guy to build
your own raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I'm talking about pretty much
is referencing the project that we got
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might work right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built their five by eight and five
by 16 linked beds out of two by eights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 16 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, my bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not two by eights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two by 12s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sturdy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a basic box built out of wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Square box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they on wheels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they stuck in place?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered the bottom with the weed fabric
to keep the soil from running out.
[SPEAKER_01]: From falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stapled it to the inside of the bed,
filled it up with our soil and rock and
[SPEAKER_01]: roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically just made a big wood pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used the weed film as the bottom of the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that up with your awesome soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend a certain type of soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something that if they're going
to go shopping, if they're going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping list, a certain kind they can put
on there just to make it easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something with a lot of organic
matter in it for long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get the best soil you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to mention the names or
anything.
That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to avoid brand names unless there's
somebody that I really recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a five by eight or a five by 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you can make whatever size
raised beds work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a guy on social media who is a
smaller fella and he has made some raised
[SPEAKER_00]: beds that are actually five by five by
five, but he put a little inlet in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle so he can walk into the middle of
it because he can't reach to work canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He decided, and he can fit them together
like Tetris pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks pretty nice in his grow setup,
but they're on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, so you can make whatever size and
shape raised beds you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in large pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to talk about is mostly
going to be in these raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the bottom in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got soil in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to put into our no
till mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of amendments are we going to
add in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what we did is we just,
we use a dry powder nutrient that before
[SPEAKER_01]: we were every week when we were amending
old soil at the end of a cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you dump it out of the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd had more compost and more of our
powdered nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just, we started with that basic mix
that we use of, you know, it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: five, four, two nutrient, you know,
once I'm not going to mention names,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just, it's like kelp and fucking
crab shell mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm looking for is a kill
crab shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just use an all in one, you know,
just an agricultural nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do a little research, they'll
probably find that product you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's got kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's crab meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Azomite in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you add some warm castings or is
that included in this product?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would also add, you know,
we normally do probably like a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: yard of compost or warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, you know, I'm talking about
a, like a 20 yard pile of soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, no, no, I'm definitely talking
about a 20 yard pile of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're adding in more like a yard,
a yard of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been getting this week after week
after week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave some room in your no-till bed,
you guys, because you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: top dress and you're going to be adding
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the plants are going
to eat that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it's going to go, some of it's
going to add in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But leave some room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fill all the way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never recommend you fill your pots all
the way to the top anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want water room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more add in space should you need
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go all the way to the top when
you're filling your raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some warm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this agricultural mix,
or you can get the independent blends of
[SPEAKER_00]: crab meal, kelp meal, blood meal,
fish meal, bone meal, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put in there, oyster shell meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add all these other things to your
mix at your discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like, you can find tons of
recipes online for making a no-till bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build A Soil will have a great recipe,
I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas Coop probably has some recipes
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can design your own recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave a little work up to
you, but we're going to give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: guideline on how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to point you in all the
product directions, but we'll give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good guideline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get caught up with trendy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the name of the label of the
product that makes this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed when you go to the farm store
and the big horticultural store,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, that work got hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't really cool logos on the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pretty babes on the
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a white bag and it says potassium
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's in that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bunch of water and a bunch of
other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, don't be sold on trendy names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be sold on advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the things that we need for the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people who they were farming
to survive before they ever had cool
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the products that the
farmers are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers are farming to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got much more on the line than a
cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're living on the whole farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeding the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the amount of soil that you
have is more important than what you put
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, as long as it's well amended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your compost is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the best compost or worm castings you
can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best worm castings you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a local worm casting company
so they're nice and fresh, they're nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should find a couple of live worms in
your castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a quality company,
there will be worms in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll still be wiggling around when they
get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a basic idea of what goes
into our mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this need any cook time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you can, let it chill for a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it well watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw plants right in here and
then it's going to start doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I hear about no-till
is it gets better every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do it correctly, we should make it
better every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time we can let it cook for a
couple of weeks or we can mix up our
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till bed, then we can throw our plants
in on day one now, if we'd like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we didn't have any harsh results
from it.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the main differences here is
we're not going to force feed these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: like we would be with bottles,
but the bottles are kind of force feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get to decide what they take in
because everything's been buffered and
[SPEAKER_00]: chelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots run around and they go,
huh, oh look, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to eat up some of that
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't need so much phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, do we need potassium up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're good on potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get this nitrogen for now,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave that potassium behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can come get that when we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant eats it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're feeding it bottled nutrients,
you're basically going, eat bitch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're force feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to eat what you feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get those burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like we'll be safe just going
right into our no-till soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't amend it so much that it would
heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with no-till, we're constantly top
dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We top dress those beds at work every
other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I may have been going into this
thinking it's too much like a super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to back my brain out of the super
soil idea and not put so much in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning and just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking sort of a wrong
direction with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to correct my thought process and I
think I just realized that I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was combining no-till and super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could start with, well,
I wouldn't start with the super soil
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe, but see that's another term that
has been diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, back in the day,
super soil meant sub cool, but now super
[SPEAKER_01]: soil could mean a hundred different
fucking, I've seen so many things
[SPEAKER_01]: advertised as super soil and, you know,
it's just, so it's confusing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to get my brain out of the
idea of thinking that this was similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: building a soil that you pre-mix and then
you just water basically till the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be more amending and top
dressing to keep this going and keeping it
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that corrects my thought process
and it'll change my line of questioning
[SPEAKER_00]: for you a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all learned something today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fun of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the beds that we have at work
that have been on the steady top dressing
[SPEAKER_01]: regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dig down into the top dress a
little bit and there are just millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking worms just eating that shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look underneath the worms a
little bit, it's fucking warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like a goddamn fucking warm
casting factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, I've never done no till with
this success or on this level before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, every day I go in, I'm just like,
fucking what am I going to see today?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get any mushrooms that grow out of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet, but maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grabbed his phone when I said that with
excitement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: My phone's literally about to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that type of charger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even if he did, it's the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new Samsung fucking charger shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like different than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love when companies do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to buy new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got an idea of what goes in at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we don't have to cook it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can throw some plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep talking about, uh, should we go
over a cover crop or top dressing first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's showing me the mycelium layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is that, uh, alfalfa or clover growing
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got clover growing out of the soil
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some stuff that is sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like malted barley and the
mycelium just grows off the barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you lift up that barley,
there's just like all kinds of little baby
[SPEAKER_01]: worms in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing on his phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the area that I can see is about a
foot by a foot square probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a small environment that is a
life cycle happening on that little photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that somewhere and create
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took that to a planet, you'd have
existence on that planet in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally, when I'm all looking at it,
think, think that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think that's where the weed
growing is because the people that think
[SPEAKER_00]: about little microorganisms, that's just
where we've gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned so much about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, Oh, there's so much life right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our friend Frosty would say life,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so much life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Frosty would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of the dude from Jurassic park
life finds a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, should we talk about cover crop or tee
first or a top dressing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cover crop, uh, there are some
mainstream popular cover crop blends and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they have plants in them that in my
opinion don't really work well with indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or greenhouse cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, currently I'm just using a,
a white Dutch clover at the agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: store by the pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it looks like it works like
four bucks a pound or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just sprinkled that in there and it
grows naturally out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you water in, it falls in and works
like nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right before harvest,
we chop it and we mulch the bed with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it gets chill for a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms come up, eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the barley into the, the bar,
the malted barley powder is like warm
[SPEAKER_01]: magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever we put it, worms show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking, it's so rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle some of that in and watch the
worms come do their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also grows the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it breaks down that waste and it just,
I mean, I know these are just indoor beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're literally building topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the picture you showed me is better
than any soil you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't buy anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that looks like it, but the little
area by the park, about 20 feet away from
[SPEAKER_00]: where the little stream runs through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that real moist, soilless,
soil kind of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting a little funk on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of swampy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you've built right there is
that type of environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't made a lot of it yet,
but we're actually making our own compost
[SPEAKER_01]: on site out of just chicken shit and,
and cannabis waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made about a half yard so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw a picture of it and it
looked really, it looked really,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you looming through it and it looked
really fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's everything that we've put it on
just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's a fucking rat, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your farm style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so far from how I learned and how I
was taught that it's fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it, but I'm still like,
wow, I want to play that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so far from all of every,
like just how I learned, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned with bottles and I was taught
with bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so was I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like leaving karate school and going
to jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, wait, I can't kick?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to roll around on the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: This sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about, so we've got a little,
some Dutch white clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some malted barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just sprinkling that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do we want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: About once a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the clover, you plant that once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend, well, not just once,
but like once per cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend just planting it after you
plant your, your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll just fill in around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, look for other plants you're
interested in growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got a big enough container,
fit them in there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a random question since we're
adding cover crop, but we're also adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're adding cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're shading the top soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're creating a little layer,
but we're also adding more plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: eating from that layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we, do you water more or less
frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find yourself in a no-till
environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: The beds that have cover crop use less
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're getting shade and you got
some to trap that water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less evaporation and then less light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to happen for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a whole nother day out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going a whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, bro,
a whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has changed much stuff at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might've talked a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to get irrigation on
it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, it's, it's going to be insane
how much, how little work it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the work's going to be just like
specifically to the plan, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not, not a worry about water in there or
this or that or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly where to put what top dress and
exactly how to time it and then where to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune and lollipop and pop and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a trellising and stuff also?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on building a trellising
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting, we're getting better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love trellising bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some guidance, just ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taught by a person who's really good
at trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do six foot wide by 75 foot
strips of just one piece of net all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's people hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in there and work them in so much
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some white Dutch white
clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our malted barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about worm castings in the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got some compost in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to need to add in
as things go on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be set to jet until
harvest time with that mix in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make a tea every other week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just basically compost and compost and or
castings and molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real fungal dominant tea and get in
there and get the roots all activated and
[SPEAKER_00]: put your microbes and get it living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little kelp and alfalfa in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the kelp will help with your
flavor and your density and the aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always think kelp helps with flavor and
density and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps encourage my saline growth real
good too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like ocean products in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically now you've just got to keep
it wet and then give it the tea and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure none of the top stuff starts dying
off on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping it healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then harvest time comes and then you
chop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are people going to say about not
flushing a no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm curious about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no flush time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all organic so we're not force
feeding it anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no built up salts and residues
to flush out while my computer just went
[SPEAKER_00]: into a screensaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We quit feeding teas a few weeks before,
but the plants are a few weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants are going through a fade
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like they naturally would because
they're, like I said earlier, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: force feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only taking up, they go,
oh, it's probably the end of my cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better start finishing up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been flowering for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvest time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chop down our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that are Harvest, Try and Cure
episodes to listen to, you can go listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on what happens to
the no-till soil after the trim crew has
[SPEAKER_00]: taken the plant out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little stalk sticking up out
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just get like a little spade and
kind of cut a tiny circle and cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: root ball out or do you just yank it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pretty much yank it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just yank it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still leaves, because you want to leave
organic residue in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it still leaves plenty of root system
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just let the worm castings and
everything else just take care of that for
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that organic matter turns into worm
food and it gets broken down and turned
[SPEAKER_01]: back into nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any time between, say we've
harvested everything, we go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out all the, basically pull out the
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is there any time between putting new
plants in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we just put them right back in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the true spirit of no-till,
you would want to let it rest for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: True spirit of no-till is going to be more
agricultural, traditional ag, so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to rest an entire season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of the, well, I won't go into
that, but yeah, I mean, so commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till is a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because figuring out the balance of
keeping nutrient and health in the bed
[SPEAKER_01]: plus keeping up productivity.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't just have half your farm
chilling for a season with no growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not an option in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us what you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word at your compromise?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're reamending, ideally we're
shooting for a week of rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cover the same day we harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give a real nice layer of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chop the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it to mulch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just stays right in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets a healthy dose of barley that
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything just kind of starts breaking
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally we'll, you know, we'll get at
least a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I don't know how well that's
going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it goes well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, well, if you re-amend,
it should be, cause the bottom part is
[SPEAKER_00]: still cooking and it's still cooking all
through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you know, I'd like, I'd like to
see like four weeks, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just not practical, um,
for, for this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that, uh, oh, it's not
because the things are breaking down the
[SPEAKER_00]: dying root matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask, if you think that that
whole four by four or five by,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we have a five by eight,
that five by eight bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that thing is, it looks like
when you pull a plant out of a pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's got roots just thick everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that whole section is just
Rudy like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because things are eating it and decaying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, like I said earlier,
this is fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to envision what's going on
toward the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can totally envision what's
happening about a foot in for two feet in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's going on that far into
that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like another part of our talking
about the depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, true, true, no till I feel like
we'd be putting a clone in or I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: say true, but the way most people know
till they, so when they replant the bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just putting in a little tiny
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we replant it, I'm putting in,
you know, a 24 to 36 inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, to put, you know, they're in a two
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we till the top foot of the
bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that that's going to wreck
all kinds of, you know, the biological
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that's been built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time you're introducing
fresh stuff with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's another one of the
challenges of a no till commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a place that has to harvest 52 times
a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it sounds like you've got a pretty
good hold on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good idea of how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm faithful that as long as you keep
reamending, that you'll be able to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: running that bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely going to work some soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a grower that was growing in home
grows for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day in Colorado, you guys,
we could run a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to the doctor and you could
say, my neck and my back, my neck,
[SPEAKER_00]: my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would say, well, then you need to
grow 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your medical record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you'd say my money and my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'd write you out a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wallet's too fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave five of those hundreds at the
counter and you can have 99 plants in your
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine having 99 three gallon pots worth
of soil to get rid of every 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to be slightly discreet
about it because you don't need anybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighborhood to know that you've got
99 plants down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got a little nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running the no till,
you don't just leave that pot right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably never do another non no till
style grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's super fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you guys heard it from Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just, I mean, you got to have the
right amount of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to pull off real no till
and like a 20 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking like 50 to a hundred gallons
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a kiddie pool in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: About as small as you'd want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some of those companies that make
the smart pot style raised no till beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that build a soil place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a couple demo tents rocking with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're in the area,
go check out build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a cool place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growers working for growers,
which is that sounds cheesy, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why it's cool because they are growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they definitely are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all looks up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've called up there a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet we went up on a Saturday to pick up
soil once many moons ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of, that was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like some of the growth shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered most of the stuff,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about feeding it a T.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major questions that you've got
was, is it cost effective in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, have you found it to be cost
effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's only your first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in half a year I'll have
concrete evidence, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so far in your, so far in your
following phase, does it look like your
[SPEAKER_00]: weight is going to be comparable to what
you're familiar with in your original,
[SPEAKER_00]: your other styles that you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: This harvest, I think it's maybe just a
little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I knew what I wanted to do,
but I hadn't worked out a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the feeding schedule and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started it, I started really
light, you know, I didn't want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to overload the soil or, you know,
lock it out or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the exact opposite of what a
lot of people will do on their first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely got yielded as much as we
did when we were growing in the pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's in a little bit of, um,
we use bio biz a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes stuff taste real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so on the beds, uh, the, we were using
three liquid products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we didn't use any of those in the
bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you know, so we got probably a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, that works out really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the cost of what you're
putting into it is way cheaper than going
[SPEAKER_00]: and buying or having a bunch of nutrients
delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay for all the extra
stuff that's in the news that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're not buying a brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every commercial girl around here is
using, uh, one of three very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: brand names, probably four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think of four specific brands that are
very popular and all the gross and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get the job done.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to buy them right now to get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one brand that you can't buy it as
a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to buy it as a commercial girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a commercial account and
you have to order a hundred pound minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have, and they like to sell
you 150 pounds because they come in 150
[SPEAKER_00]: pound drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to buy 150 pound drum and have
it delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good stuff though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I would buy for commercial girl
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know so much about it's why
I'm able to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I buy the hundred and 50 pound
orders for other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was doing commercial any other way
than this, that's what I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great success with that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's two varying ways of
growing and we're both totally satisfied
[SPEAKER_00]: with what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're both sitting at a table smoking
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't have to fight about
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our point is to grow the best weed we can
so we can all smoke good weed together and
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow anyway, you know, pay me the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see something that we can touch
on that another person asked was,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it a labor effective cost wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah, I knew that was going to be
your answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why save that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I knew it was going to be short and
quick, uh, less man hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and less we use less water to less man
hours and less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saving a lot of money there
through the most expensive things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow other than electricity and you're in
a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just cut down all the money.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bro, is there anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to add about no till before I
ask you this one last note that I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: written down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I mean, if you're serious about
getting commercial going, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can people find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your newest Instagram handle?
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just Jesse goes at Jesse grows on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Joe dirt maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's overgrow who had Joe dirt is this
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's going to take a quick look for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will come see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to set up some other big no
till places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hit me up dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not cheap, but we are worth what we
charge you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pay your consultants what they're
worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't try to cheap out on consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a random rant, but uh,
you can pay a cheap consultant to come and
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck everything up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can pay us the correct price
to come and fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could just pay us the correct price
to do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first time that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, before we started recording,
Jesse made a joke and said, remind me to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about dirty Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't mean white Mike,
the guy that comes on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He means something about a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's taking a drink right now,
but as soon as he's caught up on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let Jesse talk about his
dirty microphone story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, um, I played drums in
a couple of punk rock bands and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the best band I ever played for,
which didn't last very long because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I sit down at practice and,
uh, the, the old drummer had saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I look over at his, his Mike and,
uh, his, his Mike covers, like covered
[SPEAKER_01]: with pieces of food and fucking just shit
and fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so, so fucking nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like a well-known drummer here in
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it just did back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like, like, you know,
like a inferiority complex compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that nasty shit and I'm like,
oh, he's human too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spits when he sings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all of us other grody fuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately that's all too common in the
music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a pawn shop microphone,
you got to take it home and sanitize that
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, uh, the box, the big box store
whose name I shall not mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody goes to to buy all their musical
equipment, who was the musical devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed to buy in microphone
vocal mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can buy in drum mics and like an I
five or whatever, but they can't buy in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vocal mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these Sennheisers, they totally
couldn't buy these because we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: spitting into it for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great story, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful end for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how people are going to remember
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, you've got a few listeners and
you've got a mic in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to tell the world while
you're here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going down to Oklahoma this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the show will be released by
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put it out by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I'll be down there at ninth,
10th and 11th, uh, hanging out,
[SPEAKER_01]: checking out, trying to, uh, find some,
some clients to set up some no-till grows
[SPEAKER_01]: for him or any kind of grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Oklahoma and you need some
consulting in the next weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit up our friend, Jesse grows at Jesse
grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's handsome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a deep voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will come set up a no-till grow in
Oklahoma for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, outdoor light up, um, all kinds of
stuff I can help you with.
[SPEAKER_01]: S O P's, um, just per cost projections,
uh, genetic acquisition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, just do everything you can think
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in the industry long enough to
know, uh, the shifts and what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the way your market is going to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling us as consultants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny, but we know how the
market is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this market here for the past
12 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've also been in several grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we also know how compliance is going
to go for you in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us come in and set up your grow to
be Colorado compliant today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way in the future, when they come
and make rules, you're ahead of the game
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can be an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the, whatever the control board
is, if they like you, it really helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to be, if you're the good kid
in school, the teacher likes you,
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulation boards, when it comes to
cannabis, they like the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're like, Hey, look, we,
we already preemptively did this before
[SPEAKER_00]: you made the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, damn, you guys are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll really enjoy coming to
your facility and they'll be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: lenient when does go wrong because one day
something will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't say it better myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost my exact speech too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, uh, yeah, if you get too many
clients, bro, you let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, um, I also, uh, storefront
and accounting, uh, I don't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, but I got plenty of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a magical lady that, uh,
I'm working on a business plan with her to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the front of the house retail
consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend her for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got you covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get your grow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get your retail going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's enough pitching us as
consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think that's what we came
here for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was randomly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, hit me up though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, even if you just want to get high,
I'm going to be staying, uh, real close
[SPEAKER_01]: to, uh, uh, where the two interstates
meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So central location and okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: See there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys find him and get lit with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, yeah, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say anything weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I almost have to edit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to skip all that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking time out of your
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out and take some dads without
these microphones.

[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up this part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be back in just a couple of
seconds due to the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will, uh, I'll put a bow on
this bitch is what I think we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
