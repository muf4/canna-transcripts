by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Halo Live
Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Headbanger and Infinity
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
deconstructed sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what a deconstructed sour
diesel is supposed to taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that this concentrate was sour
and gassy and fuely and funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do know that it got me heavily
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs for the delicious Halo Live

[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did say we were going to do a strain
review in this episode and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that part of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain reviews are always some of my
favorite episodes and it seems like you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys really enjoy them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to talk about something I created.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like showing you pictures of my
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really good time for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you guys get to
learn a lot about the products I create.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little bit of insight into my
brain of what my goals are and what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a little less rambling,
let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow is one of my newest releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am mostly known for making kind of
candy, fruity, real terpy, real high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC sativa dominant hybrids and crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a male known as King Solomon who
puts really high THC into most of his
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have selected very candy flavored,
very distinct terpene profile rich female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what I make comes out very
candy flavored, very sweet, very head
[SPEAKER_00]: buzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been asking for more
of an indica buzz, more of that garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, more gassy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: More gassy aromas, more feely funky sort
of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't particularly breed for what
everybody else wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding for what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm kind of an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making art that comes from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In turn, that makes a quality product that
the market wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sells to the consumers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can tell by listening to the
opening of the show, all of the dabs I
[SPEAKER_00]: dab, I give away a lot of what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about, I give good hints on what I
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, when it comes to
my dabs, not just recently, lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: since probably the fall, I've been in love
with funky, gross, garlicky kind of terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's real savory, garlicky,
funky, body odory, maybe some armpits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got maybe a little bit of hints of
vomit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in love with those types of
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I acquired a cut of the GMO a while
back and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next step for a breeder to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: To breed with the cuts that he has
acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took my prized King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Solomon briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is Golden Goat and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Golden Goat female pollinated by a
Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a real sweet tropical flavored
female that I pollinated with an OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog cross of a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Arise is very well known for putting
out high THC offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tests near 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 35.84.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other 34 and 33% THCA
tests that come from Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it very consistently puts out high THC
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male in there that I call King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to study King Solomon,
you'll understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon's got a lot of wives.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's bred a lot in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made a lot of quality offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that King Solomon is a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he makes tremendous THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of call him the fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a female plant that doesn't
grow the way that I would like it to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't produce the way I would like it
to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate it with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a phenotype that comes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will correct the problem and make it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the original plant you had plus
better structure, faster growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper vigor, and more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Solomon is my fixer plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call him the King.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the fucking King.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not found a better male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took my male King Solomon plant and
of course I pollinated the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I should say is GMO does
not stand for garlic, mushroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk briefly about the GMO name
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is a chem cookies cross and it was
never meant to be garlic, mushroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got chem dog in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Girl Scout cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smells really funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a phenotype that goes around
Colorado, the phenotype that I bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from a guy known as Skunk Masta
Flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear this one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love and respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk called this plant the GMO because it
smelled funky and it is bred to the Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the time that this strain became
popular, the Girl Scouts of America were
[SPEAKER_00]: under scrutiny because it had been
discovered that their Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: were being made with GMO products and they
weren't quality cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to even go down that route,
but that is where the GMO came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you a weird GMO vibe
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Girl Scout cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads us to the Girl Scout cookies
being discovered that their product was
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with GMOs and non-desirable shit
for us to put in our bodies and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it to us at a premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the GMO and the Girl Scout
cookies is what sparked the idea to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not garlic, mushroom, onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may smell like garlic, mushroom,
onions to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a concentrate of it that smelled
like mushrooms and Swiss cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not why that name came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to dispel that myth,
that rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put Skunk Masta's real story out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called it GMO because it's got Girl
Scout cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like chemicals and the Girl
Scouts were under scrutiny for being
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered that their product was laden
with GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the GMO name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the plant a little
bit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant grows really tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a problematic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pain in the ass of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work in a commercial environment,
but it is not going to be the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the boss happy and it's not going to
be the one that gets the grower a bonus
[SPEAKER_00]: check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make big giant buds, but it grows
very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of stretchy and it has issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes to get Cal Mag deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some other problems to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a finicky little bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't feed it right, it doesn't
give you what you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the GMO female and of course I
pollinated that with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was my goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to get those garlic turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like mashed potatoes and with garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garlic mashed potatoes or it's almost like
you're dabbing or smoking a savory thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Thanksgiving meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted that garlic turp, but I wanted a
better flower, a better plant structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and a shorter flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO takes a little bit too long to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds aren't very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super potent and super tasty and it's
very effective, but it could be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal was just to improve it,
keep that turp, but improve on that lanky
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty structure and improve on the
flowering time and also improve on the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest weight because it does not put out
big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course I pollinated the GMO with
King Solomon and now we've got Dark
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip a few things and I want
to tell you why I call it Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow of course is a Grateful Dead
song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite Grateful Dead
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite versions is off of
Bear's Choice, Best of the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: volume two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acoustic version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a lot of weird info you
probably don't care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in that, I want you
to be able to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow by the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really good version of that song
is on Reckoning, another live album they
[SPEAKER_00]: put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes big dark leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype that will make nearly
black purple leaves and they start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this weird velvety texture toward the end
when you start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dark colored leaves, it had that
dark flavor to it, savory flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stuck for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to do a full episode on how I
name strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I just want to give you an
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead song.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dark Hollow, the song name,
the leaf color, it all worked out for us
[SPEAKER_00]: with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes big fat, dark colored leaves,
Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the aromas and
flavors that you will get from Dark
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic aromas come through very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also hints of rubber,
like car tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also hints of, if you've ever
popped open a fresh jar of tennis balls,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of what it smells like,
fresh tennis balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes it smells like new shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a brand new pair of Nikes
and you open up the Nikes, that leather
[SPEAKER_00]: and rubber smell kind of comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of got that sort of a smell to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got gassy aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are gassy, gassy aromas in some of
these phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one phenotype that makes a
disgustingly amazing sour vomit aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot get enough of that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds terrible, but it's
like, that's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me smell it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so disgustingly pleasant,
but I cannot stop smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's real savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say bottom end, lower sort of notes of
smells, not the high sharper stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower stuff, real savory garlic,
gas, rubber, tires, stabby says it smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like leather boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will agree with that because of the
shoe factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like a pair of fresh
leather Nikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that rubber, got the leather,
like you just opened up a fresh pair of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordans or you're walking through the Nike
store, kind of does have that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call Dark Hollow deep thinking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I breed puts me, I
purposefully love to smoke myself into a
[SPEAKER_00]: panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke right at the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know what's going on,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke right to giggles,
right to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dark Hollow, I can smoke myself into
the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't breed things that make me
go into the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I can turn off my entire body
and go numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get into a little bubble and I can
just think, and I just end up in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's meditation weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just, nothing's going on around
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you could burn down the entire
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could move all the furniture out as
you, as long as you don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The couch I'm sitting on, I'll never
notice if I've smoked enough Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts you in this little, puts me in
this little, just a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it thinker weed or bubble weed or
meditation weed, or it just feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just isolated in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a scary way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shuts everything off around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're one of those people that has
a hard time shutting things down,
[SPEAKER_00]: this may be good weed for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to go to class and kind of be
able to just shut everything off and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the professor and just take
notes and learn, this may be the shit for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not multitask weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fucking do the dishes and listen
to music weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lock in and fucking be in your
brain kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tastes real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real nice buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about, this is a grow
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about growing
Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tough choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I prefer to grow it or smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, I don't want to make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Green Dot for
the Halo Concentrate got me thinking down,
[SPEAKER_00]: down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me if you had to make a decision,
you can either grow weed or smoke weed for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of your life, but only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one are you picking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet at GFYH podcast on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about growing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it in most of my strange
descriptions, but these plants will get
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to get tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO plant is known for being very
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that chem dog kind of a
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that cookies kind of a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets real long and lacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll, it'll grow rope vines on you if you
let it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to keep it a lot of light to
keep it nice and compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of cracking of the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about popping stems a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab the stem with a couple of fingers
in one spot, a couple of fingers on my
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab right above it with a couple of
fingers on my thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I simply twist in different directions
until you hear a little pop, just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: snapping sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have now broken the cellulose
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of that plant growing vertically
straight up, it's going to send some
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to healing that broken part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like them nice and thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to grow on them nice and
wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and crack those stems because
they're going to get very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will also be plenty of distance
between your nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, this cross likes to put
some distance between the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give it plenty of light,
you'll minimize that, but it will get some
[SPEAKER_00]: space between the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does allow a lot of very easy trellis
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a person that does trellising,
this plant will weave into the trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: very easily because of those long
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself on track talking more
about the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do the 21 day stretch on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably going to get really tall
during that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the stretch slows down and all that
part where it's stretched fills in with
[SPEAKER_00]: big fat, thick, chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will make just giant chunky colas the
whole way through, but it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get big stretchy plants at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them time to fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I keep saying, it wants a lot of
light, a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants really seem to like a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some big leaves on
some of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some big giant black leaves,
big giant bright green leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: big giant purple leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in the flowering phase, they may
start to turn like a champagne pink sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a color as they fade out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of the larger leaf phenotypes
may be droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker grandparent on the Arise
side had very large leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that male would droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hadn't met his DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just had such big leaves that sometimes
they would just hang down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, bro, these leaves are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not holding them up all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to kind of let them droop a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see these plants drooping a little
bit and you know that your water is fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that your DLI is up to speed,
don't stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants that comes from the
daybreaker grandparent, I think it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Joseph OG grandpa to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see some droopy leaves and you know
you have watered, that is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some really long pedials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will stick really far off of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people think that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait coming from the
daybreaker, also the Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long pedials is to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple pedials are not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some purpling in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a cold issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what this plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make colors like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see long purple pedials
and big colorful leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get long branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of long, long branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many side shoots, but really long
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow kind of like OG Kush,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with growing OG,
it just gets long and switchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once you put it into flower,
that long switchy shit will fill in with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be ready for kind of stretchy,
long, pain in the ass plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be the easiest plant
to grow, but in the end, it will be well
[SPEAKER_00]: worth all of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it grows kind of like OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who's familiar with OG knows that
these plants will need extra cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies often needs more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG needs more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be on top of the cow mag for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see the little spots forming in the
middle of the leaves, that is probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it's spider mites, pay attention,
that is probably your earliest sign of cow
[SPEAKER_00]: mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cow mag is going to be the most common
deficiency with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get kind of stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to double in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need some sort of sticks,
tomato cages, or trellises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow these plants with sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times I do trellis and tomato
cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer sticks with these plants because
of the way they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get four big tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use those four big tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can kind of put them in the room
real close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I do it with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the cages with the dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to trellis, trellis it
early because it does get stiff and woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that these phenotypes,
something in the genetics, it tends to get
[SPEAKER_00]: stiff and hard toward the end of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be really easy to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it again, cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must really mean cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to want extra cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to notice a couple of
different, very distinct phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a black-leafed phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black-leafed phenotype, you'll notice
it early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: About week four or five, it'll start
turning darker on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pedials will get black.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black-leafed phenotype has a tendency
to look angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in flower, this is a trait from the
Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in flower, the leaves will go really
dark in color and maybe they'll just start
[SPEAKER_00]: doing weird colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start doing weird claw shapes or
the leaves will start doing weird shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait from the Girl Scout
cookies and it just happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot keep that plant happy all the way
to the end, no matter what I have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed the blacker-leafed phenotype
prefers lower pH and cooler temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that dark colored phenotype,
lower your temperatures, lower your pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may make that plant a little bit
happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got the green-leaf dominant
phenotype and you'll be able to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys this plant makes really dark and
really light phenotypes and it indicates
[SPEAKER_00]: early that lighter green colored phenotype
is going to like your standard
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and your standard pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say standard, I'm talking like 77
to 82, 84, whatever you guys are doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow and your standard pH like five,
nine to six, four, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to the darker-leafed
phenotype, you're going to want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: like 72, 74 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a little bit colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can certainly take a colder night
temperature and you want to drop that pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down to like six, six, two and stay there
with the dark-leafed phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm giving you advice based on
my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your room, your nutrients, your equipment,
your plants, everything is going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your style will play a factor into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything I say is from my experience,
what I've seen through testers,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've seen in my rooms, your
experience may vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to give them more CalMac.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a schedule that says this is
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants say, don't do this,
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants say, please do this,
please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be in control, but we also need
to be open to suggestions from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to make quality product in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't pay attention to the
plants, you don't have quality product in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take everything I say, very seriously,
but also know that your room, your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: your phenotypes, everything are going to
play a factor and you may have different
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I've noticed, those green,
the bright green phenotypes like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: higher temp and a little higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the darker colored plants like
the cooler temperature and the lowered pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few more notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, harvest times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker colored plants, they will take
less time than the bright green colored
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that the dark hollow takes somewhere
between nine and 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly say nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an eight week phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find one that grows really black
leaves, really wide black leaves with
[SPEAKER_00]: purple pedials, and it makes really dark
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is almost a copy of the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one finishes in the end of week
eight, 56, 55 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's ready to chop down and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may find that eight week phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nine week phenotype is a beautiful
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that cookies aroma and flavor and
funk and stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got the garlic in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just enough darkness to give it
some really beautiful colors on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't take 10 or 11 weeks to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find another phenotype in there
that is very bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one is kind of, it's more
like the 50-50 mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the Arise in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the GMO in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a sweet garlicky thing to it,
but that one's going to take you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our Girl Scout cookies
dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the one that I think is kind of
a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's going to take about 10 and a
half weeks to flower probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got our, the dark hollow that
it looked like JR token nailed this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it was bright green,
but right where the leaves are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticking out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were starting to turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the sugar leaves were turning
purple as they were coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he took that one nine weeks and it
looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it looks like a giant menorah of
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he hung it upside down, it was
nothing but bud from the base all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fat chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure he took that one nine
full weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to JR token.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see his photos on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shameless plug for Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis friendly social media
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can post your cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Cannabuzz on your iPhone or your
Android device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a sip here and get my
voice and myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a few distinct phenotypes to
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Girl Scout cookies looking
phenotype that wraps up around week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that sort of 50-50 looking
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little bit longer,
10 and a half, maybe 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got that beautiful phenotype
that gets dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes purple leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fat chunky colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like garlic and sweetness and a
little bit of gas and some dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your nine week phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing the greener buds start
making purple leaves around the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you flush it, those purpler leaves
start turning gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a beautiful phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about some of the aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype that smells like rubber
early on turns to gas once you dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rubbery tennis balls, fresh Nikes,
when you cut that one down, trim it,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry it, and cure it, it tends to turn very
garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when the garlic appears,
is later in the dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you extract that, if you make a
squish, that's when the garlic really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really comes out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a phenotype that smells sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a gross sour smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a longer flowering phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I didn't find this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was presented to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled sour and gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I say smells like a
bar trash can or a little bit of vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoked a bowl of this one,
it had the most intense eye buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to explain it other
than my eyes got really heavy and vibratey
[SPEAKER_00]: and bloodshot red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went straight to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the phenotype that smells acrid
and sour and has a little bit skinnier,
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, super serrated leaf, that one is
going to be a crazy eye buzzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really intense on the eyes,
straight to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I just wanted to stare at the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like my eyes wanted to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more notes that I've said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about the leaf droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you guys to freak out when
the leaves get droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait that comes from the
daybreaker mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the crosses, more of the indicum
dominant stuff that comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker will get these droopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a problem with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem with the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what these plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure she's not too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's not too dry, that's just
what the plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when the plants have reached their
DLI, when they've had enough light for the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, they will droop just to show you,
I've had enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to photosynthesize anymore
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a little break just like
a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they've done their work for the day
and they're done, they just go lean
[SPEAKER_00]: against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is leaning against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put its hat in its face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking a little break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you guys to freak out if you
see purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're going to get purple
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see purple pedials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see straight up purple branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will turn into the black
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker leaf phenotypes will smell
gassy and garlicky and delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have that Girl Scout Cookies
dominance in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that those will be great plants
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one, I said it smells like a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that smells like something's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever left a pot of soil in water
too long and it got sort of, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: crappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like dirty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells like it needs to be
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be flushed or wiped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really bad, sour, disgusting
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an aroma that one of the
phenotypes make.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the grandparents is Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Joseph OG and Chem D makes the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Joseph OG in there is what is
giving us that funky, it's really gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my nose go, it makes my whole
body go, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it smells terrible when it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like you've got some sort of
anaerobic fungus going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have never found a problem in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never found a problem with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the other pots or anything had an
issue, but this one plant just made this
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible, barfy, fucking disgusting aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you dry it and cure it and
smoke it, it is so dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it down the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a garlicky, dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's growing, if it smells like
it's disgusting, don't be worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said, you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like there was something dead
in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like a mouse climbed into the
pot, dug a little hole and died in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we were smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the fucking plant, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get that aroma, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize that I did that to your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it that fucking dead mouse phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that if you get
that, you don't freak out because there is
[SPEAKER_00]: one that really smells horrible in the
best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I think that wraps up my notes that I took
[SPEAKER_00]: for the review on the strain, dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are phenotypes that will finish up
in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good phenotype that wraps up in
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find some that take 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are a couple of phenotypes
that go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell them by their
skinnier, skinnier leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more desirable phenotypes,
in my opinion, have wider leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skinnier leaf phenotype you get,
you start getting more toward the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got plenty of other offerings that
give you that golden goat dominant flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really look for the wider leaf
phenotypes when it comes to dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to get those
garlicky, more savory aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taller the plant, the skinnier the
leaf, I feel like the sweeter and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical flavors you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like those broader leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the dark colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the pukey, crappy,
gross kind of smelling phenotypes early
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeding it, give it cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go macro deficient early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you give it cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing issues early on,
it is probably cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see those leaves curling up and
twisting up, that's just something that
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotypes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they look like shit by the end,
but they really harvest well and they
[SPEAKER_00]: taste amazing and smoke well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just treat them the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters and pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've got for you for this
