[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 870 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got a great podcast lined
up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to let
you know that I have updated the coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: codes at acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use my coupon code IRIARMY at
acinfinity.com, you will save 10% off of
[SPEAKER_01]: your purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I did have to update that
coupon code is because now those codes are
[SPEAKER_01]: available for Amazon and eBay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big benefit to that is if you are
shopping on Amazon, you can use your
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon Prime for free shipping on the
smaller AC infinity items.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the taxes will be cheaper if you
shop on amazon.com depending on your
[SPEAKER_01]: location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So use that coupon code IRIARMY at
acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the Amazon and or eBay store for AC
infinity and get that 10% coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more advertising at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a bunch of great content planned
out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a great comment on YouTube that I
wanted to address here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it came from somebody called
ZZ Trop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said something that's been
getting my attention, a phrase that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: popping up, something that I just wanted
to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could almost be a pet peeve,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if you've been watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember for a little while I was
doing grow room pet peeves, things that
[SPEAKER_01]: just drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phrase in this message, just for some
reason, it bugs me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, how does a seed
increase work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple multiple male pollination or a
selected male?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, how does a seed
increase work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is a seed increase?
[SPEAKER_01]: A seed increase is a new word that I've
recently heard popping up in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, I'm going to do a seed
increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make more seeds is what
that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem with that is it's not an
increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you put that male plant to that
female plant, you are creating a filial,
[SPEAKER_01]: an F1 filial generation of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And or at the same time, progressing a
filial generation or you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something, a back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a seed increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're doing S1s possible,
you may consider that a seed increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only possible way that the term
seed increase would work in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see this term being applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's a real horticultural term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is a seed increase?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either making more FEM seeds or
making reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, use the correct
terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you making because you're making
another generation and label it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took a pack of, we'll say Jack
Tripper seeds, you could get a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've made more seeds, but you did not
make more Jack Tripper F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have now made F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So label that properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a seed increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a forward in some sort of filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does a seed increase work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something that recently popped
up in the fucking cannabis ganja growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, seeding world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the phrase seed increase,
because that just makes it sound like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to create more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to do that, like I've stated,
there's got to be a forward filial
[SPEAKER_01]: generation unless you're only making S1s,
which then just say I'm going to make S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to self and I'm going to make
FEMs, which makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got more notes I wrote down on this
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new term.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every pollination is a generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just label it as such.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either an F1 and S1 and R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's an F7.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unlikely, but it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that makes more sense to me than the
phrase seed increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make more seeds to make
the seeds available, but it's deeper than
[SPEAKER_01]: that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some more care for your project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making more seeds, but what
generation are these seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that will matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are going to say, why are you
so picky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you so critical about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my job, to be picky and critical
about this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to make more seeds,
they should be properly labeled with the
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what breeding is,
part of what a good breeder does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just label it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my ramble rant for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: ZZtrop, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep this podcast moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say Grow Help or
Grow Questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you can send me
a Grow Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question that came from the Grow Help
tab today came from my new friend Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Green Tea, make sure you check your
inbox because you've got a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, this is more of a breeding
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it actually starts with greetings from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friends in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to know we've got Irish growers
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, this is more of a breeding
question, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you store your pollen long-term?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still in an illegal country,
so we have to do things on a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, will lemon Jeffrey seeds be coming
back?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very common question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will make more lemon Jeffrey seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like making new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm limited on how many things I can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon Jeffrey is super popular,
but I like making new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will make more lemon Jeffrey as the
bottom line, but it's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question here is, how do we store
pollen long-term because we're in an
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal country, have to do things on a
small scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox for the
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's address this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we store pollen long-term?
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently used some pollen that was
stored for about a year, and it did not
[SPEAKER_01]: give me great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used pollen that has been stored
for three months and six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three-month pollen seems to be the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: That six-month mark is when it really
starts fizzling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three months is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two months is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: A month is great, but after two,
three months, I think really it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: losing its potency, its vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't store that pollen for too long is my
first piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice, you may find better advice that
will say you can store it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take a big bag of pollen and sprinkle
it across the room and that pollen is two
[SPEAKER_01]: months old, I should get so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's six months old, I'm going to get
half as many seeds as what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year old, I barely got any seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That older pollen, it just starts to
degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to last forever,
but let me get to my notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing, pollen collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is going to start when you
were collecting the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to get that pollen bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you collect the pollen, however you
do it, you can take it from the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: while the plant is alive and upright,
or you can chop the tops and put them on a
[SPEAKER_01]: container and collect the pollen some sort
of way on a glass container or a cardboard
[SPEAKER_01]: box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the pollen out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get more pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most important parts is to pull
out all of the vegetation, all of the male
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers that come with your pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything green, anything leafy,
anything that is not pollen, use a sifter,
[SPEAKER_01]: a screen, and some tweezers and get all
that shit out of there because that will
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminate your pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: With moisture, and moisture is one of the
number one problems, the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: killers for this pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you collect it, make sure that you
get all the greenery out, all this male
[SPEAKER_01]: flower parts, anything that contains any
moisture, get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want any moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get this pollen nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend adding a silicate packet
if you can, not a Boveda packet,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a moisturizing packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want something to suck up the moisture
and make it as dry as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silicate packs that they put in food
products, the silicate packs that they put
[SPEAKER_01]: in your jacket pockets when you buy those,
we want this nice and dry, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the pollen dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all the male flowers out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put it into an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a glass jar if that's your
preferred method.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a plastic baggie if that's
your method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a plastic vessel will give you
static electricity and your pollen will
[SPEAKER_01]: move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe not one of those plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people try to use like a plastic
peanut butter jar and the static
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity went crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably killed the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I'm thinking about it,
but I recommend a glass jar or I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: using plastic baggies and putting the
multiple plastic baggies inside of a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend an airtight sealable
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten all the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we seal it into an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get an opaque glass jar,
that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label and date your jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever vessel you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write whatever pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise F3 pollen, January 5th, 2029.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making shit up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write the date and the strain on there so
that you've got a clear indicator of what
[SPEAKER_01]: that was, especially if you're fucking
with more than one kind of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got a dry batch of pollen
with silicate packs and an opaque jar that
[SPEAKER_01]: is labeled and it's airtight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, that pollen is pretty
preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best you're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, I would put it in
either the crisper drawer and the
[SPEAKER_01]: refrigerator or maybe even the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done both and I've had similar
results with both options.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crisper drawer where the vegetables
should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also where I keep my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put the pollen jar right in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe put that in a bag, a brown paper bag
to keep it dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just add that extra layer of darkness
because darkness is also your enemy when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all the shit removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a silicate packet in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a dark jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's airtight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I put that either in my freezer or in
that crisper drawer and I store it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark the date on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you know how long it's been in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have an idea of when you're going to use
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have an idea for it coming up because it
will expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's most of my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only reliable for about three months,
maybe six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the notes that I definitely wrote
down are once you store this pollen in a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool, dry, dark space, especially if it's
the freezer, don't remove it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer until it is time to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say this about seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from the cool into the warm
environment, especially if you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: warm, like a summery environment and your
fridge is nice and cool, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: create condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bottle here, there's no condensation
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been sitting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show you my condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been out of the fridge for just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll start dripping down your jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want any of that condensation to
form near your pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't pull it out until you're ready to
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one time is just enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it in there until it's time to
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then go get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take it out and show your friends a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get it out and stare at it and think
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put it in the freezer, leave it in
the freezer until it is it is time to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with that crisper drawer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to create any moisture,
any condensation in that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to say that moisture killed the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of true, but not accurately
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water activates the pollen and makes
it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it spends itself is kind of it
activates it and makes it do its process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, then it's spent and
it cannot be active anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that it is killing it,
but it's not exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the water will destroy the pollen
overall and so will the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't let too much moisture get in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let any moisture get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the fridge technique,
avoid condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you do take out that pollen
to use it, if you decide today is the day
[SPEAKER_01]: to pollinate these plants, when you remove
that pollen from your freezer or your
[SPEAKER_01]: refrigerator, leave it in a room
temperature area and let it come to
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't rush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't speed it up and don't apply it to
the plants while it's still frozen or
[SPEAKER_01]: still cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it get to room temperature slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it take 12 hours if that's what it
takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let it get to the room temperature
before you apply that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll help you out a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I covered most things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect it, get it dry, dark, airtight,
label, crisper or freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only rely on it for two, maybe three,
possibly six months at the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use stuff that was a year old and I'm not
satisfied with my results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize you are not getting the seeds
I hoped you would get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't even know that they were
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it adjust to temperature and don't
pull it out of the freezer too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically my advice on storing your
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of advice for much
longer term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen just seems to degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a time sensitive product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's somebody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that there is somebody out there
with a much more scientific approach and
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends, I'm not afraid of constructive
criticism or to be educated on my own
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a better, more reliable
scientific way that a home grower could
[SPEAKER_01]: store their pollen for future use,
the comment section is wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how you're storing pollen in the
comment section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go have a conversation down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage community interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of community interaction,
don't forget about the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep this conversation going on the
Discord server as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a link in the show notes and
in the video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've made some changes to the Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vibe is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crew is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're stuck on the rules, I've said
this a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We updated the new rules and regulations,
the etiquette and rules it might say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to re-click on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that tab, click that you agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will let you right back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out back on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my friend, Green Tea out there in
Ireland, I think I've answered your
[SPEAKER_01]: question more than thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've encouraged people to give us
feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all I have to do is send you a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question and keep
the fight going down there in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I admire you for going down there in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep this podcast moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one more great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question came from my new friend
Eclipse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I love the show
and I wanted to thank you for all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding knowledge you pass on in every
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for listening and thanks for
noticing that I'm trying to pass on the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I do a little breeding myself and
I normally get seeds from seed banks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have found one or two seeds and a
few ounces of flour that I've purchased
[SPEAKER_01]: from dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that does happen, especially with
dispensary product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am assuming that this was due to
rotolization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could have been a lot of causes to
this and we're going to jump into that
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not mistaken, since it's only one
seed in the entire ounce, I was wondering
[SPEAKER_01]: if these seeds are worth a damn because
the flour was killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown some out in the past and
everything went smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I just continue using the cultivar
if it doesn't harm or is that process of
[SPEAKER_01]: seed making inducing stress that is passed
on to the next generation of seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I didn't confuse you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last line did a little bit confuse
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you could tell, but I understand
what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were finding seeds in your dispensary
herb and you want to know, are they worth
[SPEAKER_01]: growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to address how those
seeds could have been made because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get us further in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seed could have been made from,
like you said, rotolization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is letting that plant go too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's natural defense mechanism is
to make a seed so that it can survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants main goal is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's to get us high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main goal of these plants is to
reproduce, to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The females is to receive pollen,
make a seed and continue that generation
[SPEAKER_01]: next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole point of that female
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that doesn't happen, the Jurassic Park
effect will come into play sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life will find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will seed themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is rotolization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting it go long enough until it freaks
out and creates seeds on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also could have been from stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been just a stress induced
panic seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been from an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been from actual male pollen
contacting that female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unlikely but possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also could have been an intersex plant
letting out pollen and contacting this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of options on how this
seed could have been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't assume that we know how that
seed happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it was in a dispensary,
in a commercial cultivation, we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody could have had pollen at home,
had pollen in their dreadlocks,
[SPEAKER_01]: came to the grow at work and got pollen in
that grow and now you've got just a
[SPEAKER_01]: straight F1 of something cool that they
just seeded on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you've got, we call that bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we do not know how that was made,
we kind of know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Maury Povich situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know who the baby daddy is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely know who mommy is and you
know it was good weed because you smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you enjoyed it but we don't know
who the daddy is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call that bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a seed that you found in your
bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked are they worth a damn to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't share them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you like growing and you find those
in your bag, grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a free seed to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a free experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind you could have a complete
intersex mutant trash plant that grows
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit and tastes like you're smoking
cardboard and mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could have found something like
let's talk about some strains that are
[SPEAKER_01]: legendary that were bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that were not meant to happen but
are some of the most popular strains on
[SPEAKER_01]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start with a little line
called Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the Chem line, all of the Chem Dog
seeds came from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short story is a couple dudes were
selling dog bud on the Grateful Dead tour,
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling around selling dog bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: They met a dude known as G.
[SPEAKER_01]: G made friends with the boys that were
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going quickly here giving you the
quick version.
[SPEAKER_01]: G made friends with the boys that were
selling the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: After tour G went home and messaged the
boys and said I need more of that herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent him and it's confusing at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the story says a quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the story says an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Variations in the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were seeds in that delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 13 seeds was the legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can google the legend of Chem Dog and
the 13 beans and you'll find details on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find names.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it all together if you really
care to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within that, I need to take a little sip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even going to edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that delivery of herb, allegedly,
there were 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: From those 13 seeds we got Chem Dog,
Chem 4, Chem D, Chem Cis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of males that got
thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there were more Chems that I'm
not thinking of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91, that's probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the Chem stuff, all the Chem Dog stuff
came from that bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy who's now known as Chem Dog,
he's fucking world famous in the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and the cannabis community for
finding these seeds and growing these out
[SPEAKER_01]: and putting these plants out into the
world for us to enjoy, to smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow, and most importantly,
to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the Chem stuff was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy fucking found these guys on tour,
bought herb from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent him weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within that weed was 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew those because he knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like I might have, the weed was
excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like I might have something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found different phenotypes that are,
we can identify the different
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of those Chem lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put them together and grow them and
smoke them, you can taste and see and
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and feel the differences in the
buzzes and the aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number 4, in my opinion, has got the
tires and the chemically sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 91 is more skunky and a little
funkier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my two favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chem D has got that decently sort of a
thing going on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what I've experienced when I
smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are differences in the Chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those came from what is called a
bag seed, which is essentially what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was seeds in it and they grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find also Golden Goat was an
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole story about Golden Goat,
Golden Goat was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an accidental pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a male in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pollinated a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds that came from that were fucking
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden Goat was a straight up accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Gorilla Glue was an accident or GG4,
whatever we have to call it now to avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: getting sued, was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josie Wales was pretty open that that was
an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure he said that that was an
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best strains we've ever come
across, and if I'm wrong about GG4 because
[SPEAKER_01]: my brain just questioned on that,
was GG4 a purposeful pollination or was
[SPEAKER_01]: that an accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: Argue about that in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind being updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a bag seed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you see three examples and I think
Girl Scout Cookies was bag seed also to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you the truth, but who the fuck
knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of legends around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your own research there, but bag seed
could be the new hottest shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing about it, nobody else has
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you found a bag seed from something,
maybe somebody else has it, but what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the chances that another guy or girl in
your region went to the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: bought the same bud, found the seeds and
thought, I should grow this also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what are the chances they're going to
find the same phenotype as you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing in that neighborhood,
you've got something brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody even meant to give that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got kind of a prize there and
sometimes a phenotype, a cultivar that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody else has can set you apart from the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why everyone's looking for new shit
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has Skittles now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's got fucking Skittles crossed to
Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're looking for what do we cross
it to next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's got the next shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they need the best product to set
themselves apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the new part of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I answered this pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth the damn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, grow it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have some amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what caused that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't assume what caused the seed,
but we know that you've got it and we know
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a crazy herm or like we keep
saying, you could have chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've answered this question quite
well.
