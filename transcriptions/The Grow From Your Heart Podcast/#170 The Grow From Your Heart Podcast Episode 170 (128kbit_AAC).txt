Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying not to cough.

[SPEAKER_05]: I reached over, turned to the music and
coughed at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I sped through the intro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, also welcome to the
podcast sitting across the table from me,

Instagram now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been posting some cool ganja
pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the strain you posted the other
day?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Smurf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Smurfs.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the cross on the Smurfs?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's blue tie something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue tie something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of a strain from a shop you
used to work at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of why I asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering how much info I was going
to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like we're we need to cut this part
of the conversation short.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving forward, ladies and gentlemen,
make sure you go stalk Jesse while he's
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, go check out my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to HandmadeApparel.biz because this
part of the podcast is brought to you by
[SPEAKER_05]: our good friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, my friends at Handmade Apparel
made me some hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the Grow From Your Heart podcast
logo right above the left breast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have my face on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the back, it's got the Grow From
Your Heart podcast logo with my big cheesy
[SPEAKER_05]: face on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: These hoodies are sweet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're interested in one, send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten two emails so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took on a new project and I have not
replied to many emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will get back to you probably after I
record.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested in a hoodie,
send me a message.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse picked up the hoodies and made the
big, cheesiest smile that I've seen in a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty cool looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird to see a hoodie with my
face on it, but people will be wearing
[SPEAKER_05]: them and I'll have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be an interesting
podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been taking some big fat dabs of
some Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a fun show.
[SPEAKER_05]: But big shout out to my friends at
Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need some shirts made, if you need
something printed, if you need stickers,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you need some hat pins made,
go check out HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great people, great folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thanks for the hoodies, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Said it once before, but I can't get over
that logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks so sweet on a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super, super high quality printing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that printing smooth?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like they put a sticker on a
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's so clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially once it ages a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope as fuck, Jesse said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Jesse's kind of into the punk rock
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once it fades and doesn't look brand
new, is that when you're going to like it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it doesn't look so fresh and clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to kind of wear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to go spill some beer on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did I want to make sure to
mention?
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I thought about the other day on
the podcast, and I'm sure that Jesse will
[SPEAKER_05]: agree with what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another word I was trying to
find, but I can't find the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I owe you a huge thank you for
trusting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys listen to me and I give you
advice about your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are used for your medicine to keep
you healthy or in another way to keep your
[SPEAKER_05]: wallet fat.
[SPEAKER_05]: However it's happening, I'm helping you
out and you trust me with your financial
[SPEAKER_05]: and your medicinal investment and your
time and your energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You trust what I say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for trusting me and thanks
for, for trusting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for believing that my guidance is
correct and thanks for believing in me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized the other day that there are a
lot of people out there that say,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's ask Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just thanks for believing in me and
trusting me to guide you through your
[SPEAKER_05]: garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's enough rambling for the
start of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's here and he wanted to talk about
composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a message and he said,
I have had composting on my head all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I don't think compost is quite
what's in your head, but it's close.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk a little bit about
composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you want to start bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to jump right into it with
anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I don't even know where to start.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the first note that I took was
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bokashi is for anyone that's not
familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a grain that has been inoculated
with an EM1 culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: An endogenous microorganism.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how that's done?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they spray like a barley.
[SPEAKER_04]: You soak or soak it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: With possibly a dairy product.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you end up with the EM1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fermented milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you take a culture you collect and you
mix it with milk and it ferments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how you end up with what they
call labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lactic acid bacteria.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, you can turn that into EM1
and you can take the EM1 inoculate your
[SPEAKER_04]: grain, ferment it again, let it dry out
and boom, you've got Bokashi grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you making the Bokashi or are you
buying the Bokashi pre-made?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting the Bokashi right now from
Victor with Innovative Organics up in
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good and it's pretty damn
cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and he's a small local business that
is that's taking food out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's teach the people about the
Bokashi bucket a little bit then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you said taking food out of the
landfills, that's going to make people
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see one from where we're sitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be advantageous to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically a five gallon bucket with a
spigot on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little collection tray in the
bottom that prevents the solid particles
[SPEAKER_05]: from getting in the way of the spigot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically I fill that thing with my
vegetable scraps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't eat any meat products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all my vegetable scraps, the tips of my
carrots, the ends of my avocados,
[SPEAKER_05]: the avocado pits go in there and they
disintegrate completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that goes to waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything I would throw away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sitting near the trash can to
encourage me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of putting it in the trash,
it goes in the Kashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fill it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fill up a bowl, like a glass bowl,
and then I dump that glass bowl into the
[SPEAKER_05]: Bokashi bucket because it's much easier
that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have to open it as frequently
because it smells like hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got a five gallon bucket with a
lid that seals on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a spigot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually put a thin layer of newspaper in
there just to prevent... That's a good
[SPEAKER_05]: idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some of that particle stuff will
clog up the drain thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you put the paper down and then you...
I just put like a couple of banana peels,
[SPEAKER_05]: honestly, in there to get started.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to eat a shit ton of bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two banana peels in there to get it
started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a handful of the Bokashi grain,
because that is a bio-activator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just start throwing all your
scrap in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you get a nice layer,
maybe an inch or two thick, then just put
[SPEAKER_05]: another handful of that Bokashi grain on
there and repeat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make a lasagna basically of scraps,
Kashi, scraps, Kashi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's an inch and a half that they
say to put in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every inch and a half, throw in more
Bokashi grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't press it down, you guys,
because it's going to expand in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you do want to press it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do want to press it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the air out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to squeeze all the oxygen out of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most Bokashi buckets come with a little
masher.
[SPEAKER_05]: That little masher thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's when you push it down that it
farts and makes that horrific smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also, you can squeeze a shit ton
of chile... The leachate juice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Leachate out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever tried to clean a drain with
that juice?
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just tried it the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it work for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's pretty fucking clogged.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I poured... I even made sure I had enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I poured, fuck, like a half gallon in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that should have unclogged.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's like a hair clog, that would
have done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got something serious in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you eat, boy?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just a sink.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you make your little lasagna,
then you pack it down and then you seal it
[SPEAKER_05]: up and just leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after about 10 or 12 days,
it'll start making juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can open up the little spigot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I use a glass mason jar to catch the
juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I seal it up and then I cover it
with, honestly, with just a rag to keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: dark because you want to keep that away
from the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I put about an ounce per five
gallon bucket when I go to mix up some
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients, put about an ounce of that crap
in there and a five gallon bucket with my
[SPEAKER_05]: newts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can see the plants start up taking
much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I... I'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just full of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the nutrients from the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just... That's all I'm using
now in my grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even at the big grow, we've started
using it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will save on trash, save on
nutrient money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's full of humic acids, fulvic acids,
lactic acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got bacteria and fungi in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the things that you probably
forgot about and that your bottled
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrient company probably missed also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all kinds of... It'll speed up the
root zone, speed up the metabolism of your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that lactic acid, bacteria
juice out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll start growing this white,
funky foam.
[SPEAKER_05]: These big, gross looking, brainy bubbles.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's happening, you did it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because once you've drained it a few
times, I mean, you can drain it a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can leave it going and keep draining
it and mash it and drain it and mash it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll go for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But eventually, what I like to do after
I've harvested, I'll take my old dirt and
[SPEAKER_05]: pour it into a big... It's like a feed
trough for horses, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour all the dirt into there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll pour that Bokashi bucket into
there, all that funk and mix it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mix that in with my dirt and cover it
and put a little moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it spreads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like that stuff, whatever I
made in the Kashi bucket grows throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: my soil at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just goes stirred occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll try to do it... I'll try to
get two full Bokashi buckets in there
[SPEAKER_05]: before I go start to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, the smell is intense when you got an
empty one out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of smells... Especially if you're
indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like somebody threw up in the bar trash
can after drinking all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And rotten milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they ate ice cream and then drank all
day and then threw up in the bar trash
[SPEAKER_05]: can.
Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just drain a little... Mike can't
be around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: White Mike that's on the podcast often.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, if you're going to do that,
I'm fucking going home.
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't even be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys at work love it when I fill a rez
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the Bokashi people on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a company called Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use 55 gallon drums of the mixture
and then they use a forklift to lift it up
[SPEAKER_05]: and dump it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could just imagine what that smells
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just 55 gallons of dead body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Victor's doing the same thing with the
innovative organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, what was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, when you were talking about putting a
lot of banana pills in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool thing about doing this process is
the compost that the Bokashi will
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually make, the pulp itself and the
leachate from it are both... They contain
[SPEAKER_04]: the nutrients that the plants contained.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bananas, for instance, are super high
in potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want a custom tuned Bokashi
juice, I mean, look at the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you filled that thing with bananas and
banana pills, I guarantee it'd be high.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put berries that are darker in
colors, you're going to have a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of humics and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got your Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got this whole fuzzy white mess of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got jars of lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you said your next thing that you got
going was your worm program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about your worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started with a hundred worms back in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: A potential vendor brought them in and
just gave them to me and I was like...
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Red wigglers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red wigglers, there was a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like you're going fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took it home and dumped them in a
smart pot full of food scraps initially.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put just straight peat moss in there
because that's something they eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also did, I think some newspaper
then, and I kept them through the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't like real actively feeding them
or anything, but now that winter's came
[SPEAKER_04]: around, I took, I think it's a 40 gallon
container and filled it with all the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: necessary for a good proper setup of worm
bedding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been dumping the Bokashi pulp in
there and they go fucking nuts for that
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've got... So I mean, it's cool as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making all my nutrients at home
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you tell us a little bit about what's
in your worm bedding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got some used phone books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think all phone books are used.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know why the fuck they still
make them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a waste of trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worm food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shredded them up and a bunch of
newspapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used wood chips.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a comfrey plant at home,
so that's indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went ahead and chopped all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to turn that up for you,
turn that into usable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which that's a whole nother part of my
little homestead style growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: the comfrey that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I put some of that in there and then a
full bucket of Bokashi stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to love all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I figured out... So the Bokashi stinks
like hell when it's in a open worm bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this time I put a whole bunch of thick
layer wood chips on the top and then a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of wet newspaper to seal it all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of trap it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the smell went... I can't even smell
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the winter like this, it's cold,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably 12 degrees here in Colorado,
maybe lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been hanging around like 15,
20 degrees easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight it's going to get stupid cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my garage, I'm guessing it's going to
be in the teens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I be able to keep my 40 gallon worm
life container in the garage right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a similar situation, but my garage
is heated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's around 65 degrees and they don't
give it like... You would almost think...
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume that that dirt is going to
be hot anyway because it's bioactive in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The little worm farm I have, most
definitely it creates its own heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more established.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big one, I just set that up last
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure it will start heating up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to like just say,
oh yeah, you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing I would for sure do is lift
it off the floor.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it off that cold... Your plants want
to be off that cold concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concrete really sucks for plants unless
it's a real fancy heated floor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets so cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cold, so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a heat sink.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually steals heat out of things that
are sitting on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like when you're drunk and you lay
in the bathtub, you have to cool down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done that shit in so long,
but that was the first thing I could think
[SPEAKER_05]: of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got your bokashi, you got your
worms and you're using a big 40 gallon
[SPEAKER_05]: container.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is going into your compost?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kitchen scraps at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once spring comes around and it's not cold
as fuck, when I get my outdoor compost
[SPEAKER_04]: pile going, I'll be putting all the
chicken bedding in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mixed with chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you put like meat products in there
also?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can in bokashi, or they say
you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually saw somebody, the bokashi
people put their entire Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_05]: dinner, their turkey, like the carcass of
the uneaten turkey, the mashed potatoes,
[SPEAKER_05]: they put the entire thing in there and
then they showed the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they took the thing outside and
dug a hole and buried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they planted a tree on top of
where they buried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, they claimed they could put meat
in there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just took a little longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They even say you can put feces in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things I'm not brave enough to do and
things I'm not going to do for my indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: pot garden.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had a big, huge, gigantic outdoor
garden, that would be it.
[SPEAKER_05]: End of the world scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even dairy, cheese and stuff like
that, they say you can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put eggshells in there to increase
the amount of calcium?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally put eggshells in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like coffee filters, newspapers,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just eats that right up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff just disappears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get a lot of leachate off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I've been putting all my cannabis
scraps in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you run them through, if I was to
throw the leaves and stuff off my plants
[SPEAKER_04]: in the garden into the open warm bin,
I would lose most of the nitrogen and fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: what else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would lose carbon through the CO2 that
it emits as it dries out and breaks down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Running them through the Bokashi bucket,
you retain all of that because it ferments
[SPEAKER_04]: it first and it traps it in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then it's healthier food for the worms
and it makes a higher quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just richer, much richer.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That fermentation is what gives it that
amazing smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Victor's been teaching me about the
wonders of Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, shout out to Victor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like he knows what he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We totally get him on the show on these
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Victor, you're invited.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll probably have to be on the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to wherever he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a huge warehouse full of fucking
Bokashi buckets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just go sit on a bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll all get a Bokashi bucket as a chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smells a little funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're a ganja grower, it smells kind
of funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's a sickeningly satisfying
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, that smells terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take five gallons of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that that's going to make it like
fish hydro slates and like Bokashi juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Nirvana and Piranha or what was
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Piranha and tarantula from Advanced
Nutrients when they made the liquids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, those things smelled like the women's
bathroom at the park in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_05]: summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: They worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could feed your plants very little of
those things and your plants would just go
[SPEAKER_05]: ape shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never used them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, I used all of the
Advanced Nutrients products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one I've never tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to bash anything, but that's one that
I would avoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: They promise you that you'll get 30%
heavier yields, which it did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me probably 30% fatter yields than
any other brand I've ever used,
[SPEAKER_05]: but all of my different strains looked,
smelled, and tasted the exact same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hypothetically, if all those strains hit
30% THC with my regular regimen,
[SPEAKER_05]: they all hit about 20, 25 when I used
Advanced Nutrients, but they were heavier.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot more of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather grow a pound and a half of
Superdank than two pounds of meh.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are extremely overpriced.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you that working with them as a
vendor and a company, they are fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every hydro shop that I've tried to mess
with has said that because I would be
[SPEAKER_05]: like, Hey, can you order this new Advanced
Nutrients product?
[SPEAKER_05]: And people just shake their heads and be
like, Nope, I'll take what they send me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They send me boxes of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sell that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You replaced them with Psycho,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a side by, I've done a lot of side
by sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: This show just got off on a way sidetrack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not prefer Psycho either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Psycho gave me a lot of great colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me bud density and it gave me
weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did not approve of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor was where it was lacking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything tasted like grape Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to be how all those multi-part
lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the bottles look clear with different
dyes in them, it's all probably,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion, I don't know this for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should research this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably all came from one factory
and they just get poured into different
[SPEAKER_05]: bottles and get different names put on
them or something similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a rule of thumb, this is just my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a rule of thumb, when you're
shopping for a nutrient line, try to stick
[SPEAKER_04]: with an American made nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are by far the best quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Avoid Dutch nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch growers grow a completely different
way than most Americans and the nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: are formulated differently and they don't
really work well with the way most
[SPEAKER_04]: American growers grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with most of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have seen some great results though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few people that die hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We order it for a couple of guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right though about ... I've got a
note somewhere that says to talk about the
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch bred cannabis to be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because their grow rooms ... The way I see
it, cannabis happens on a rocky mountain
[SPEAKER_05]: in Afghanistan where a goat pissed on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wind beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun beat down on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a likelihood that a rock fell on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: On the side of the Kush mountains in
Afghanistan, a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The original popping.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original super cropping actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: A rabbit lives under it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's covered in bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what the fuck my rant was
all about now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a brain injury guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I forget what the fuck I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the Dutch got a hold of these plants
and like, we want to grow them indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what a fucking Dutch accent
would sound like if I tried to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, we want to grow these
indoors and they wanted to find the best
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They bred it to be these really skinny
sticks that grow really perfect buds and
[SPEAKER_05]: now it's like roses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like tulips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch is all about the flower industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here in Colorado, California,
the states that are catching on,
[SPEAKER_05]: we want to grow dank, robust plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand about full plant health.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're breeding for complete plant
structure, not just tulips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, most of the time I can pick out a
Dutch strain or genetics from Dutch,
[SPEAKER_04]: from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll a joint and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll three joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put two American strains and one from
Amsterdam in there and I guarantee I'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to pick out the whitewashed,
just completely blended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Berries and flowers, no bud structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go bash every Dutch seed
company, but I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'm just hitting guys hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also avoid... And don't shop here either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then ban this website.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I think the Dutch have kind of
wheat and some American breeders are
[SPEAKER_05]: probably susceptible and guilty of it
also.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably bred because we wanted to
find... Back in the day, we didn't have a
[SPEAKER_05]: high pressure sodium lamp or an LED.
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably were using whatever finagle
lamp we can put together in the garage to
[SPEAKER_05]: make some space to try to create a 12-12
flower cycle out of the few seeds that we
[SPEAKER_05]: did get from whatever weed we got that we
didn't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: That some dude told us was tie stick,
but it was probably from Mexico,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we thought it was cooler to tell our
friends it was Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're growing these fucking maybe tie
stick, maybe Colombian, maybe Jamaican
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds that could be males, could be
females, could be who knows what it is and
[SPEAKER_05]: they got to figure out how to grow that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we may have gotten rid of the good shit
back in the day because we didn't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: right lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have the right knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just wanted something that finished
quick and didn't climb up into the lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew for three years before I ever saw a
clone or even made one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just did a bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I would kill to have some of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about how many, I used to buy
Mexican schwag weed back in the day where
[SPEAKER_05]: I live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican schwag weed was $450, $500 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could get a half ounce of seeds
out of it that looked like good,
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy, viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost wonder what I would have gotten
from them because you know those Mexican
[SPEAKER_05]: crops weren't producing a low yielding
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the lime green Christmas bud?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew out some seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did that come out?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was lime green Christmas bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just, I guarantee that it was
like 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago when it went fucking head over
heels for it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that you call it Christmas bud
because this town is known for getting the
[SPEAKER_05]: light green lime green Christmas bud right
around Christmas.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I know more about growing and
everything, I guarantee that's probably
[SPEAKER_04]: autoflower, the late season autoflower.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of talk about the Mexican
cartels using autoflower strains so that
[SPEAKER_05]: they can keep stuff going year round.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about the one crop that was
busted in the forest near us that was all
[SPEAKER_05]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's how they do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those grows are cookie cutter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single one of them is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're in different locations,
but the way they grow, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cops, I can tell by looking at the
pictures most of the time, even the cops
[SPEAKER_04]: know, you know, the DEA, there's just a
certain, like fucking Billy and his crew
[SPEAKER_04]: were here again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're ever going to bust out a big
old grow somewhere, find out what that is
[SPEAKER_04]: and grow just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some Mexican food, like buy your food
from the Mexican store with no English on
[SPEAKER_05]: the labels and just store a bunch of it
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think that's what gives them the
first hint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, it's a bunch of, what did they
call them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican nationals is what they labeled
them as in the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We found tortillas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job police.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to get mad when I found seeds in my
weed, like pay good money for kind,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there'd be seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just paid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a half a gram of seeds in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm like, what happened to those
seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: I threw out the window on fish tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I wish I had those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, um, when I was out in California one
time, the first time I, um, was exposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole medical marijuana scene and
everything kind of changed my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I smoked some OG Kush out there from
my then girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, uh, cousin that was full of seeds
and I brought him back even and just over
[SPEAKER_04]: move, moving from, you know, over the
years, I, uh, lost them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, yeah, you'll find them when the
time is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they're long gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to know you guys to talk about
my first experience with medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: because I just, I've got a cool fucking
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to tell it on this,
but it's another podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I saw a 4k room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all lined out all fucking now that
I'm a more experienced grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: like total Cali style, fucking flood and
drain tables, rock wall slabs and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fast track.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the, oh man, all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought about that room then,
like just how huge it was and how much
[SPEAKER_04]: money they must make and all that and how
much work it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I kind of chuckle, but yeah,
four lights, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the first big fucking room I ever
saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I, I, I try to now when we walk,
I remember the first time that I walked
[SPEAKER_05]: into like a giant commercial grow,
I had to like kind of bite my lip and try
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep my face straight instead of shit
in my pants and get in a boner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now when I walk into big grows,
people still try to like the owner of a
[SPEAKER_05]: girl will walk in and they peek at you and
they try to read your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just try to keep that straight face
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, this is a cute grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: When sometimes I'm like, Oh my God,
there's 500 lights in this one room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check out some cool girls and
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're jaded now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been to too many places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put too many hours in, in too many
facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in more facilities than I care
to admit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been in half the facilities in this great
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little bit more about
composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to ask a couple other questions
also, but I just wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_05]: what was one of your, what's your favorite
shit to smoke?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were talking about seeds and I
had a strain in mind that I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_05]: you about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I wonder if he'll mention
that because it was a Pueblo favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's one of your favorites to smoke?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen that shit in years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: P bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: The P 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: P 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: P buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the Kim dog dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember getting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my favorite stuff to smoke nowadays is
just like, Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yetis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: The P 91 was amazing though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Yetis a great stuff to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet the P 91 was related to like the
deep chunk sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pit bull and there's bull rider and
like Northern lights five, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could Google it if you want to make the
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of thinking of bull riders in
Afghani and Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five, I believe is the Indica
version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could be completely wrong by the
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's bull rider or pit bull,
which is they're similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a, it's from stony girl seeds is
who actually put that one out in seed form
[SPEAKER_05]: in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now there's another company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was gold coast genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe who I got the seeds from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: They charged me way too much, but for the
nostalgia, I was like, I need that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, I've been real, I hold the
seeds like they're precious and I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: pop them at the right time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm expecting company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our good friend, Lindsay, the traveling
stone owner and Bobo are coming over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Bobo blaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Co's birthday was a few days ago and he
got a sweet new rig from our friend's
[SPEAKER_05]: rebel glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take some dabs out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some time left.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to give you a warning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so that when they, cause I just told
them to show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just going to walk in
eventually and we may either hand them a
[SPEAKER_05]: microphone or we'll wrap up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very informal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about composting until then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've, um, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm trying to remember where we are
at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we've got the worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about getting it in a 40
gallon container.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got your worms living in newspaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you got ground, uh, chopped up phone
books, wood chunks, bark type stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine come free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, the Bokashi pulp, the Bokashi
bucket pulp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that's pretty, Oh, I threw in,
um, some oyster shell and some malted
[SPEAKER_04]: barley seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oyster shell just to, um, give them some
cow mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I was told by a worm keeping
friend that oyster shell helps bulk the
[SPEAKER_04]: worms themselves up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll make them fatter, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And make them eat more and make them work
a little harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and, and, uh, part of my plan with
this big worm container is to release in
[SPEAKER_04]: my garden in the spring, early summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that I'm just, I'm building up the
soil in my garden year after year after
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can dump, I mean, fuck 10,000 worms
or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might end up with shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just turn that soil all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you and your dad go fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, but I don't use worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fly fishermen, purist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to just go sit there all
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, that's not really my type of
fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we've got, we've gotten dope ass
compost now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to cut some of that 50% 25%
with regular soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, let's act like we're going to put
it into a potted plant to grow either
[SPEAKER_05]: indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much of that compost do you want to
use?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you're building a soil from
scratch, I would recommend like 30,
[SPEAKER_04]: 40% compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you don't have to use that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I mean, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if it's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got that, you know, do you want
to top dress that or do you want to blend
[SPEAKER_05]: it in when you start?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're building the soil, I would
totally recommend blending it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you are a top dressing,
I would do, I want to say like a quarter
[SPEAKER_04]: cup per gallon container.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you got a seven gallon, I would
recommend three and a half cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put, you did the odd number to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you trying to think of what I do
the, uh, what I tell the guys at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, and if you're recharging the soil,
um, or like reusing a soil like Jeff does,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I would, I would probably say like
20%, 25% maybe, maybe even as low as 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of depends on how much aeration
your soil has and if you want to add any
[SPEAKER_04]: in or if, or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aeration is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, we learned our lesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I put some plants into cocoa and I did
not put anything in there to aerate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those plants pretty much gave me the
middle finger their whole lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super compressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to fill that up with some perlite,
put something in there to kind of air it
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you can also make teas with your
compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what I was going to ask next.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with compost, make sure you,
you, um, have a consistent temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told, um, if you let it get too
warm, you can potentially have some funky
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff going on in there in your tea or in
the compost itself in your tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a lot of people talk crap about
compost, um, or you'll find people that
[SPEAKER_04]: talk shit about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one of the things they claim is,
is, has E.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coli in it, which it possibly could have
E.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coli in it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also has a million other fucking
things that are way nastier than E.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coli that don't harm us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't a large percentage of your fruits
and vegetables have E.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coli anyway, when you purchase them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trace amounts at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're shipped there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, so would that mean maybe not to
use a compost tea as a foliar feed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's, that's the way to get around
that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just feed it to the roots and not the
foliar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I personally would never use an actual
compost tea for foliar either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would strictly save that for warm
castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the way to get around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No worry there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feed it to the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Magical happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: The E.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coli goes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and also with compost, you can make a
concentrate where just take your compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in a cheesecloth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, massage it in water or underneath
water for about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like put it in a bucket of water and just
kind of rub it out a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, well that's kind of what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I was trying to let that joke
fly, but that's actually what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're rubbing it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need it like a loaf of bread.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, perverts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that makes a compost or warm
casting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do either one, a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it has a longer shelf life than an
aerated tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you're taking old food scraps and
recycled dirt and putting it in
[SPEAKER_05]: cheesecloth and squeezing it and making
your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop making waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop wasting shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop spending money on companies
that do not really support the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: movement or us or our wallets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop making trucks drive across the
country with bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's, you're paying for water when
you buy whatever brand to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love botanic hair, but still every time
I buy a bottle of pure blend pro or liquid
[SPEAKER_05]: karma, I had to pay a truck to drive that
shit from Arizona to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I had to pay some dude at a hydro
shot with a mullet to fucking unload it
[SPEAKER_05]: off the truck and then sell it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had to buy it home and measure
it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably could have just taken some kelp
and seabird guano, whatever the fuck else
[SPEAKER_05]: is in that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could have made my own probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even veg plus bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you want to grow salts,
you know, you can still be kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: environmentally friendly.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm getting at is I can make that
and I don't have to add to that truck
[SPEAKER_05]: driving, that emissions, the water being
shipped, the gas, the exhaust,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we could do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only that, you're diverting food
from going into the landfill.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're just, you're basically money
from going right into the same landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it back into your crop, back into your
wallet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're producing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not depending on someone for that
little tiny bit of your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it only may be that part,
but I love, you know, trying to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: producer, not a consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may sound a little weird, but there's a
good feeling knowing that my vivacious,
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy, green, vigorous cannabis plants
are on nearly the same diet as myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me think maybe other than all
this freaking Dr. Pepper I'm addicted to,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe I'm green and vivacious and vigorous
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeps me strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, dude, we've been going for like
40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything else you want to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Composting before we get a doorbell
ringing and we get some new stoners
[SPEAKER_05]: showing up?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, we can wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can touch back later if anyone's got
any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can easily talk more.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting good at podcasting by the
way, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really comfortable now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than being a little cold in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I'm trying to build my schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a busy life that was all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always had a busy life, but it,
you know, a few months ago it just all of
[SPEAKER_04]: a sudden like really stepped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good, but it's bad for my podcast
and I have all these ideals and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just plans and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to adjust into my
schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Expect a kickass podcast coming from me
besides the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got a new idea coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go with, I'll go ahead
and, but it's going to be the high grade
[SPEAKER_04]: homestead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and it'll be more than just cannabis
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk about gardening and
chickens and all kinds of shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff you'd find on a homestead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you ever need a cannabis expert
on that show, I'll come be on your show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show planned out for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks already.

been dabbing diet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's another dab waiting with
your name on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to be as coherent as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn also takes great care of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to the hydro shop, she's always
excited to see me.
[SPEAKER_05]: She gives me a big hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's super friendly and she is great
customer service.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting me borrow your husband

[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, homegrown homes to high grade
homestead.

brain, but I look forward to hearing that.

to iTunes and leave me a rating and a
[SPEAKER_05]: review.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you know how to find the ratings
and reviews by now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, everybody so far has given me a five
star review.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it'd be cool if you follow suit,

my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you being there and
supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I extra especially support.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys had a lot of caffeine and dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brain's going too fast, but I
appreciate you for supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said earlier, I completely
trust you or thank you for trusting me to
[SPEAKER_05]: be your cannabis guru.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like I need to wrap up the show
because my tongue is tying itself in a
[SPEAKER_05]: damn knot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think all I have to say now is a big
shout out to my friend, the barefoot
[SPEAKER_05]: grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She caused quite a stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big time high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to be just like her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make lots of money till you grow old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell your common decency for 24 grams of
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants a porno star.
[SPEAKER_00]: She drove a fast, fast car.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to teach at my high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: He caused quite an uproar with diamonds
and bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: He set a ring on each finger and ruled a
whole lot off.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us raised our hand to ask him why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was a hell of a chore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at him and it was why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here was a porno star.
He drove a fast,
fast car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main corrupto great went to the
preacher to save their souls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we asked them about their car and
their finest date, they said, we like who
[SPEAKER_00]: we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're feeling great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a porno star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are people.
I'm not a judge.
I'm not a judge.
I'm not a
judge.
I'm not a judge.
I'm not a judge.
