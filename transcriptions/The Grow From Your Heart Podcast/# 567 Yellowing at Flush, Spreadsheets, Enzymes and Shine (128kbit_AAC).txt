[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of coin style live
batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of sugar town express and
lemon G 13 on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as a coin style
margarita on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately,
I don't know what a coin style margarita
[SPEAKER_00]: on the rocks tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an alcohol drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consume any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had a margarita in at least
10 or 12, maybe 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't remember what that tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't tell you if that's an accurate
description or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is it's fucking
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is an accurate description,
a coin style margarita tastes fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of a funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually really taste the lemon G
that is in the blend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that sugar town I think is giving it a
really nice sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do really enjoy about this
concentrate is it kind of fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me like it puts on some blinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me like a tunnel vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the kind of concentrate that you may
sit down thinking you're about to record a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, you've checked your
emails for 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time has flown by.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even know any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wake you look up from the computer and
you're thirsty as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even know you've been wasting
35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the coin style live batter from
our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy this concentrate on the
back of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it contains 65.58% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rest of that is straight up
terms because this is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves a nice flavor on the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice lingering aroma in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously enjoy the coin style live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Green Dot for
the delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show the camera the concentrate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can see I took a big old
dollop out of that gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious, beautiful texture, beautiful
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work from Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a couple
of updates from previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to read some Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that part, let's do some
shout outs to the members of the 710 Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who
support the show at the $7.10 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Level or higher on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: With no further ado, let's do some shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with the big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Ms. Karen Crawford.

[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend, Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you and big shout out for all of
the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
on Patreon and you would like to learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so, all you have to do is visit www
.patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I did say I was going to do some
updates in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I talked about
grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a message from a Patreon supporter
about grafting cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said that I feel like the genetics
may move around if we graft multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: plants onto one branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a lot of maybe slightly negative
things in my opinion about grafting that
[SPEAKER_00]: were very uneducated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very clear that those were my
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said it seemed silly to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I make a grafted plant, those genetics
will not move each branch, apparently will
[SPEAKER_00]: stay true to that genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow the genetics don't move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am willing to admit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a lot of great corrections and
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grafting seems to be a viable practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for bashing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genes don't move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have good apples if grafting
wasn't a common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into another update.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a blind grower send us a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend David in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send us a message saying that they think
their plants may be finishing too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that episode went out,
I got a lot of great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the feedback came from the YouTube
channel and they were great ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: One listener or viewer, since it was from
YouTube, one viewer suggested that since
[SPEAKER_00]: this grow is possibly in Brazil,
that maybe the equatorial location is
[SPEAKER_00]: giving those plants super intense sun and
they are finishing earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because they are getting more sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: More sun is more energy for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about turning my
light cycle onto 18.6 at the end of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it'll beef up the buds because
they get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, more light is more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, maybe they are finishing more
quickly because of that intense mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve talks about some plants
finishing earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be where he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve's plants finish sooner in
near the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be getting that brighter sun,
that equatorial sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that is one of the reasons why our
friend is getting earlier finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we thought of is maybe
perhaps the, and our friend is blind,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he's got a helper who is helping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that helper is not looking at
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stated that the trichomes were brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe perhaps we have thought that maybe
they're not looking at trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps they're looking at pistols because
pistols do turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, pistols are not the indicator of
ripeness when it comes to a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pistols are basically the sex parts for a
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a cannabis plant passes its prime
time for being bred, the pistols simply
[SPEAKER_00]: shrivel up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, pistols will shrivel up from
disruption, from moisture, from foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays, from you touching it, from an
insect crawling on it, from wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things will cause pistols to curl
up and basically wither and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So possibly, we assume, we think that
possibly this assistant is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols and not trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to clarify the difference
between a pistol and a trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that everybody calls a red
hair, those are your pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the parts where the pollen will
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen will go down that into an ovule
and create a seed inside of your bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trichome is a completely different part
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the part that everybody calls the
crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got hairs and crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are now pistols and trichomes if you
want to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are what indicate ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are smoking ripe trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just happen to have those trichomes
delivered to us on a green leafy matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make concentrate, we basically
remove the trichomes from the green leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we get more lit more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much green stuff to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you're smoking is basically
extracted trichomes and the oils from
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make sure that the assistant
is looking at trichomes and not looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mushroom things that you see on the
plant, all over the plant, the crystals,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at them with a scope with the
magnifier, they look like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a bulbous head on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what we are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those in most cases with most
cultivars, with most growers for most
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say all the time because there's
never an all the time in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, most growers want to
harvest when those trichomes appear to be
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30% amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get 100 trichomes in your
view, or if you can look around and see
[SPEAKER_00]: about 100 trichomes, you want 30 of those
hundred trichomes to be turning an amber
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see clear trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see trichomes that have turned like
a milky white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see trichomes that are almost a
baby blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got like a silver and bluish tint
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will also see some that are
starting to turn like a brownish color on
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will see some trichomes that look
like they've got Dr. Pepper or soda on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ripe trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when you start to see those dark
ones are probably a little bit past your
[SPEAKER_00]: peak point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got 30% amber trichomes,
the rest of the trichomes, you've got 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to be right where you want
them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to harvest at 30%, 25,
30% amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we need a scope, a magnifying glass
to see the color of the heads of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is when we should be harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of the growers here have
listened to my determining ripeness
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, look at the trichomes,
not the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another thing that we think may be
happening in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not accusing or making judgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just ideas that myself and other
growers think may be causing this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are finishing too early,
that means you're getting buds too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to harvest too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get your crop earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to risk a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado right now, it was 85 to 100
degrees for a month straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was looking sunburnt and looking
burned out and sweaty and tired from the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then last night, it got to 32 degrees,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm looking at my little
indicator to show me the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 36 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next few days, it is going to go
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to go back up to probably 80
or 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these giant temperature swings give
us opportunity for huge problems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, a lot of crops were lost
to a surprise snowstorm here at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually don't expect snow until around
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: On September 8th and 9th, we were hit with
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of crops were destroyed outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those people that have early finishing
plants that finish too early, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get lucky and beat that early
snowstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't have a snowstorm coming
in Brazil, but you do have something
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe police, maybe robbers, maybe
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something out there that
could destroy your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's down too early, that means it's
down too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we got a lot of crops
destroyed by snowstorms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, crops are getting destroyed
by wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a very good likelihood that when
harvest time comes, maybe only half to a
[SPEAKER_00]: third of the expected crops outdoors are
going to be cut down and brought to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very good opportunity and
potential that prices will rise at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of this year and the start of next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are used to paying that low
price for their cannabis, shit may go back
[SPEAKER_00]: up because of all these natural things
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snowstorms ruined a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fires are burning down a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to lose a lot of cannabis
farms to these fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to lose a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to lose a lot of important
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm thinking about it,
I want to send some love to all the people
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering through these fucking fires and
snowstorms right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart goes out to everybody,
but big respect and big love to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers losing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get myself back the fuck on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your crop may be finishing early because
of your equatorial location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may be looking at pistols,
not trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm getting myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another theory that we think may be
happening in this grow is you were saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants are finishing about 21
days too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, perhaps you were judging the first
day of flower at the first sign of pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: and not actually the first day the plants
go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are seeing pistols and you're
considering that the first day of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend backing your calendar up
about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about 10 to 14 days to see
pistols on a flowering plant in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say all the time, every time when
it comes to cannabis, there are always
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time in cannabis, we can see
pre-flower, we can see sex in about 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're judging the day one from the
time you start seeing those pre-flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: those pistols pop up, you can adjust your
calendar, your schedule by about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, and you can say they've been in
flower for two weeks longer than what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been saying, which may put you
right on the schedule that the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended on the back of those packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the things we think may be
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be getting a faster finishing
plant because of your location on the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be looking at pistols and not
trichomes, and you may be judging by the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong start day of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be judging day 14 as day one,
somewhere around day 10 to 17,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be mistaking that for day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I'm not in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I can't accuse you or blame
you on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just theories that we think may
be happening or trying to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sharing ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on these three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if these three things can be causing
your not problem problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a problem, so there's
nothing to correct here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe, like I said before,
if you were looking at pistols and not
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, we may want to let these plants
go a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not looking at the right part
of the plant to judge maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you can improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did say you were happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can be even happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to hearing back from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big thanks to all of my friends who
left a comment on the YouTube video or
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me a message with their theory or
their idea of what they think could be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in this person's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do come on this show and I get all of
the credit for putting this show together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got to give you guys credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people gave me feedback,
input, advice and information on this
[SPEAKER_00]: exact topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without you guys, this episode
wouldn't have been what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also appreciate all of the emails and
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I love getting emails and knowing
that the questions I read are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: helping somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write shows about random topics,
re-vegging or drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that stuff will go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get ideas and I'll do a show
and I'm like, I wonder if anybody even
[SPEAKER_00]: needs this advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you send me a message and you say,
Hey, help, that really helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for all the
participation, the feedback, the input.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you this coin style live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fuck your brain up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a lot of stuff done,
but it won't be any of the shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Patreon message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to thank you for your hard
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says creating all of your killer
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says, I want to thank you for all
of your hard work creating all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: killer genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you find my genetics killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see pics of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say your amazing podcast
helped me get through my third grow with
[SPEAKER_00]: ease and confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that I'm making your grow
easier and making you more confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make you more comfortable,
more confident in your grow so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can make decisions on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't panic when shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love hearing that I'm hitting the
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that you're getting toward
your goal with my help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've just harvested some lemon,
Jeffrey, orange, Gazm, bebop, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nice selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got those lemon turps, the orange
Gazm, of course, the orange turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop has got that cushy possibility if
you get the right phenotypes and the cream
[SPEAKER_00]: is unique in its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that root beer cream soda sort of
a turp to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're making concentrates,
the cream is the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says these plants blew my freaking
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that they put on some
insane harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not write this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says all I had to do was make sure that
all of my girls were nice and comfy in a
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With lots of plant stakes for extra
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did the trellising properly,
you won't need those extra supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to dog you, not trying to
diss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to improve your grow right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you think you had to add extra?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even editing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had added, I think that's what I
meant to say, if you had added a third net
[SPEAKER_00]: or to hold those buds up, or if you had
worked those branches into that net
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, you wouldn't have needed,
my words are all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back there in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not have needed stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea when you're making a trellis is
to get that canopy nice and even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that are sticking up that you
needed a stake for probably again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see your grow, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on, but you
probably could have worked those branches
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a little bit more and kept the
canopy nice and even.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a few sticking up where you
needed a few stakes, I would have put
[SPEAKER_00]: another layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have put another layer of trellis
net to keep all those branches in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at your pictures and see
if we can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's continue with this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to talk about the trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them even.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to get a nice even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those sticks out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you need them, that may be a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I dialed in my environment and I
feed all of my girls, the feed just went
[SPEAKER_00]: as wild as I wanted them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fattened up all the way up till
harvest, but I was not able to get all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants to yellow in flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow went great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like everything went well,
but during the flush phase, the plants did
[SPEAKER_00]: not yellow as expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find that to be a problem,
but it goes on to say I was literally
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding them for two weeks and I only got
a couple of plants to yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of my plants didn't yellow at all,
even though I flushed the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, does that mean I still have a lot of
nutrients trapped in my buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing in soil with 1200 PPMs and
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I got done with my flush,
my runoff was very low for soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 110 PPMs, and this is combined
runoff for multiple plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good and unique question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, when they flush their
plants, they expect and want to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants start to turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think we're flushing the nutrients
out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants should turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should start fading and showing me
their fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not always necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to get yellow,
dead, crispy looking plants at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be nice and green and lush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be yellow and crunchy
and faded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love taking pictures when they start
turning like a little bit of golden colors
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end, they get those red hues,
the purple start coming in, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some genetics will not fade no matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they all fade no matter what you
do to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll run out of nutrients eventually,
but some, they just look happy right up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you cut them down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you dried them and cured them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry and cure process is really going
to play a huge role in this, but does it
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smoke harshly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smoke smoothly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the ash burn white?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the ash chunky?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you roll it into a joint or pack it
into a bowl and take a few hits off of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: does the part you smoke turn into like a
charcoal briquette or does it turn into a
[SPEAKER_00]: white, flaky, soft ash?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the way to judge if it was
flushed properly or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dry it and cured it, those two
things are going to come into play
[SPEAKER_00]: together at the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about how is the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you were trying to get all of the
nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean you still have nutrients
trapped in my buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of controversy around
flushing and not flushing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to pick a side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stay open-minded as somebody
who teaches and shares information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't pick a side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be biased in this topic because I
don't have enough information.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about flushing, I think that
I'm trying to clean out the soil or the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium to get that clean so that the
plants don't have any more to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to simply quit eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nutrients and sugars stored
throughout the plant, mainly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, but the stuff in the buds,
I feel like that has been metabolized and
[SPEAKER_00]: converted into buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, molybdenum, calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, boron, several other nutrients
and elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now bud material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares what I ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had food today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That food is not food inside of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now in my blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming muscle tissue, skin,
not much muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking skinny, but it's trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making muscle tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making my blood move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's providing me vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was vitamin C and iron in my food
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not iron and vitamin C right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of those things that have
turned into parts of me that have become
[SPEAKER_00]: part of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go pee or poop, it's not going to
be vitamin C and iron that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got way off track on that,
but I don't think that the buds have
[SPEAKER_00]: converted into buds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just nitrogen and phosphorus and
potassium, so you can't really wash that
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the buds, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have science behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to explain my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mixed up A and B and now you've got C
and you can't wash A and B back out or you
[SPEAKER_00]: would just lose C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you want to rinse the
nutrients out so the buds burn cleanly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think if you flushed and even if
they're not showing you that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: angry, you're not going to smoke the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves don't need to change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants are flushed and
they've stopped eating, they've
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolized all the stuff in there and
turned anything that was in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: system into smokable buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't prove that, but that's what I'm
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to smoke those leaves,
so why are you watching for the leaves to
[SPEAKER_00]: change colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than it looks fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really beautiful when you got a nice
row of plants and they've got that fall
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my fall color fucking photograph
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to make a postcard for
somebody, it'd be fall color cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, but you're just trying to get the
plants to stop eating and use up the
[SPEAKER_00]: stored food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't remove that part from the plant,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have science behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still learning, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you guys, I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be learning on a different level and
learning different things, but I am still
[SPEAKER_00]: learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I know it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never know it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the great things about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I learn something, I go, oh,
that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realize that that makes me able to
learn two more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I learn those two things,
I got to learn three more fucking things
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand those two things,
to be able to put those three things with
[SPEAKER_00]: the first two things I learned back with
some old school shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go, oh man, and my head explodes
and I just learned 12 new fucking things
[SPEAKER_00]: on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an epiphany every day in the
grow for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning, you guys, and I'm glad
that you want to learn with me and from
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking high as shit from that coin
style live batter, so I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: myself back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your plants will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flushed for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your runoff and your PPM was very low,
so your plants aren't eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've cannibalized themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've eaten all the nutrients that were
left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to know how was the smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pictures of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a report on the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came in a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how did this crop turn out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I owe you an apology because it took
me a long time to get this message on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I did say,
I think I'm caught up on Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Xavier said, hey bro,
you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You skipped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for taking a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you've cut that down,
smoked it by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what it tastes like,
how it burns, and if you're satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's see what we can improve in the
next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xavier, I want to thank you for the great
Patreon message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the continued
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move into one more email for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, thanks for being
extremely and extremely positive force
[SPEAKER_00]: during the times we all face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always super happy and positive,
but when I come on a camera or a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone, I got to be in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days I wake up and I go, ah,
there's some bummers in my life sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be bummed out all day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to have a bummer moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take a dab and fucking realize
that you got a lot of other good shit
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one bummer moment and like,
9,000 good moments every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to embrace those 9,000 good
moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stay, try to stay positive,
especially during these weird fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: times, uh, having an audience that are
basically my friends and backup family
[SPEAKER_00]: that really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a few questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently listened to episode 404 grow
lessons part four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, you are way behind, but thank you
for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I heard you talk about the shine
a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of my questions is on the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shine is a product from, uh,
it's hydroponic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the veg bloom wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says, I'm wondering what weeks of
bloom do you recommend using this shine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said using it a week before a
flower should help stop initial stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: also used during the first five days of
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also heard you mentioned that some kind
of enzyme would be good to add at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: with the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I need to use since he's I'm as my
enzymes, there's a lot of good stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about here in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What weeks of bloom do you recommend
shine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they remembered that I recommend
using it, uh, the week before you start
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to help stop initial stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shine is not a cheap product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a good price tag on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people use shine sparingly or
as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use shine extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that if I've got plants that
are super stretchy at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, if I give them a product called
shine, right before flower and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of flower, they do not stretch
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them half of the recommended dose or
the recommended dose, which I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram or two per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, start off small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to give it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have the presence of shine in there
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll say, Oh, we're going to get
fed real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to stretch real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't stretch as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like I said before, the product is
not free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit spendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to start early and spend
an extra three or two weeks using the
[SPEAKER_00]: shine, that is when you start at the
beginning of week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start a week two or week three,
the earlier, the better, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but get it in there by the start of week
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you need it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, before flower will help reduce
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having it in there at the beginning of
flower will help reduce stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having it in there early will help start
trichome development earlier, start
[SPEAKER_00]: packing on thicker, denser buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's kind of up to your budget and
how many things you want to be mixing in
[SPEAKER_00]: your PPMs, your grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's kind of what it's up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much shine do you have access to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that already, but that's how I use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go early, it will help,
help stop with the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to help stop with stretch,
crack and twist those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically grab it one spot,
grab it another, twist your hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite directions, kind of gently until
you hear a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should sound like, should sound like a
knuckle popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you hear that sound, just move up,
do it again, do that all over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, give it knuckles, burl it up real
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant will stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will spend most of its energy fixing
those broken knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to slow down anything
other than the vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making buds yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is still realizing, Oh,
it's flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to transition from vegging to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hormones are moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's trying to figure out what to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get into flower in about 14 days,
crack it, pop it, twist it just before
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, right at the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about week three, and then keep
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, that'll stop your stretch
from getting too out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add the shine and then crack and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says also used during the first five
days of flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cocoa and you're going to
flush for about 14 days, you can add shine
[SPEAKER_00]: with your flush, but make sure you flush
hard at the end to get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a, a more advanced grower
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some beginner growers may burn the plants
or have a shitty tasting product if they
[SPEAKER_00]: try to go too hard at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're flushing, you can use about
two grams of shine for the lat for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first five days of the flush cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to flush for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, you got to add time to the
flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just clean water and shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I said that I could add some kind of
an enzyme to the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like enzymes during flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is kind of budget according
budget friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you've got an unlimited budget and
you can buy some enzymes, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: big grow, enzymes get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a little tiny grow,
enzymes aren't that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy a bottle of hygrozyme or
sensei's I'm, and that'll go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it fits your budget flush with some
enzymes for the first week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that will do is the enzymes get in
the root zone and break down all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit and help clean out that root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're flushing, you're getting out
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that recycle your cocoa or soil,
that's a really good idea to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that all the small roots, all the dead
stuff, all the decaying matter in there
[SPEAKER_00]: gets broken down and cleaned out of your
root zone before you recycle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do recommend an enzyme in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like enzymes a lot in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps out, does a lot of things,
keeps the soil safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of enzymes, a little bit of
plus life together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your soil will be a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will be really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of microbes in there with that,
obviously every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of the question is I'm using
advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I need to use sensei's I'm as my
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to stick with that brand
specific nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you're using advanced
nutrients does not mean you have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei's I'm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use any enzyme product out there
that fits your budget, fits your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style, or is simply available at your
local grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some products are harder to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like to shop online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want Amazon showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered a carbon filter and they brought
me a carbon filter with no like wrapping
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just said carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck, I didn't need that
delivered here, but it came that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to order some things from
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to order something from
Amazon, like a carbon filter, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: box that says this order, this item is a
gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click it as a gift and they'll wrap it for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it shows up at your house,
it's fucking wrapped and it's not showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a box of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that shit gift wrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where the hell are we in this message?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I remember where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to say, you don't need
sensei's I'm you can use, uh, there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of enzymes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even need to list them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the one that's available for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was going to say, thank you for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to check and see if you left the
name on here, but you did not leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want your name said,
so you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the good support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should wrap it up, but since I'm so
rambly, we're going to go ahead and read
[SPEAKER_00]: one more message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of our Patreon
supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from North North Terps on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up North?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think that should be a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says great, great shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for always answering my questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a real blessing to have around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learn a lot of practical knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how punctual you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize how punctual I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I can set shows to come out
at a certain time and they pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm sitting here at the
time all these shows come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's pre program stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you mean the Instagram live every
Monday around seven 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to keep going with this email
because I'm fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, with that being said,
you talked about how well organized you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, your spreadsheets and how you love
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering if I can get an empty
copy of these so that I can implement
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm organized only in my head,
but my ADD and my bad handwriting does not
[SPEAKER_00]: allow me to do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I as I have half a thumb on my
writing hand and I haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: write well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could help me, that would be
dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked seeing you on the show more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike got a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to North Terps who did not
use a single piece of punctuation in this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just picking on you, North.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're you're missing your punctuation
thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like nothing but love for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: North realizes that I'm organized and I've
said that I keep all a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: information on spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And North is asking for a copy of my
spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a template that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up a Google document and I make a
custom document for anything that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I've got a document that says
room A and then that's a column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the side, it's just the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the date, I will put so on the
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like September 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in room A, I've got the pH and EC
of the water going into the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next graph is the water coming out
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's room A in room A out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just know that the Google doc is
actually labeled room A and the first two
[SPEAKER_00]: columns are in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every day I just know that in and
out, that's what's going in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just make and create Google
documents that work for my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: for my grow style, for my brain,
for my phone, for my iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just build them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really have custom spreadsheets
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they're all just custom for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice is learn how to use Google
documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of businesses, a lot of the future
is on Google docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to use Google docs,
get that figured out and just create your
[SPEAKER_00]: own custom spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll open Google spreadsheets,
Google docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn to use both of those and you'll
start utilizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start utilizing it to the best of
your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get your thumbs
figured out because it does require a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better typing in those small
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you'll be able to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ADD doesn't make it easier by using a
Google doc because you go to open your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone and now you've opened your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see that I put out a new
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now instead of making a Google doc,
you're watching my next podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you'll figure it out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got faith in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just open up a Google document or a Google
spreadsheet, start poking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be easier for you on a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also share the same document.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you log into Google docs with your
email address, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: northnorthterps.com, log in on your
computer, log in on your mobile device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the same spreadsheet on the
same on your both devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to do the spreadsheets on
the computer sometimes, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're missing a finger may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish I had more templates or more
advice for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I just create my own Google
spreadsheets and Google docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And write what I need to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of it happens on paper anymore
because like yourself, I've got scribbly
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting and also paper just makes
piles and gets fucking mess in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of it's in Google docs,
Google spreadsheets, and then it's there
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's in my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I go to another computer,
if I go to another facility and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at something, all I have to do is get
a computer, log into my Google account,
[SPEAKER_00]: open up my Google spreadsheets and I can
look right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can share those documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got, I've got a couple of guys
that run a grow on a weekend and I'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and I'll be like, Hey,
did you do the to do list?
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of asking them, I can open up
a to do list and see if a guy has put his
[SPEAKER_00]: initials next to the task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your initials next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's done correctly or wrong,
I know who to praise or fucking kicking
[SPEAKER_00]: the balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got their initials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see, I don't even have to bug
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We share those Google documents together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can edit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see the edits in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can put, Hey, you guys go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been working too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll get a notification that the
document has been edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go, Oh, boss said, go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's watching us on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put something funny in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're at lunch, when they come
back, they'll check the document again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find out who got to clean the
toilets at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I watched them stand around on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Google documents, Google spreadsheets,
they're free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customize it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got ADD, my documents may not
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make those documents yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it work for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to, bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have to, you can just write
it on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're taking notes and making
some sort of documentation, maybe get a
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar, maybe an old school calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that may be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just doing custom, my own custom
tailored Google docs and spreadsheets,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically rows and columns, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information that you need and the date
that you need it and fill in the blanks.
