conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're having a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're smoking something with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking some Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend, the Fairfoot Grower did the
extraction for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to our
friends at Elevate Glass for keeping me
[SPEAKER_00]: supplied with fresh, clean glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I need to give a huge shout out to
my friend Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Tater Glass for the
custom pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brand new Rasta colored pencil
dabber with a custom carb cap at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of it so I can carb my banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Jenny Beth for the
amazing Valentine's Day gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the shit out of this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should probably clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the folks that take
good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm doing shout outs, to give a
shout out to my friends at Handmade
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel, that's right, if you need some
hoodies printed, if you need t-shirts
[SPEAKER_00]: printed, if you need stickers made,
if you need hat pins made, I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend anyone better than my friends at
Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make my Grow From Your Heart podcast
hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the iReGenetics t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made my iReGenetics hat pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make most of my friends' t-shirts in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of the hat pins you see in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I fully recommend Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out at HandmadeApparel.biz,
and let them know Ross and Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know you're listening to the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: take very good care of you on your custom
printing needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this episode is going to be
part two of preventing, identifying,
[SPEAKER_00]: and eradicating your common garden pests
and issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of words for a podcast title,
but this is gonna be part two of all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to talking about new issues,
I need to mention some stuff I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we talked about
fungus gnats, and we also talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we spoke about spider mites,
I forgot to mention one helpful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you start seeing spider mite
webbing developing in your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can easily vacuum it up with a shop
vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang onto the plant very carefully,
get the shop vac, and just suck those
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mite webs right the fuck off of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you've got spider mite webs,
you've got big problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get through that harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to clean that up, and then you
need to figure out why there are spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to correct that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to seal your gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use some pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use some predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get rid of the mites if you've
got that big of an issue, but the shop vac
[SPEAKER_00]: will certainly work to help you clean up
spider mite webbing should it be there in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I should talk about,
another way to really easily find an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: in your garden is to be there every day
and just take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody stares into the plants all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stare with a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see any stippling.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see little bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if bugs fly up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if bugs fly up out of the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if anything looks out of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look and see if you have some sort of leak
or drip coming from an air conditioner or
[SPEAKER_00]: a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to find an issue early is to
look every day and pay attention and be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is go there and look
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay some attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some time in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to walk in and just pull a leaf
from a random plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to pick a different plant every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there are no bugs, no issues on
the bottom side of that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly ever problems on the top
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it from far away if there are,
but grab some leaves, pull them off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, take a look, and see if you notice
any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, another really easy and simple way
to prevent problems in your garden is to
[SPEAKER_00]: simply clean up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave leaves on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave dirt on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave your tools in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought some soil and you plan on
doing some transplanting, don't bring that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil into the grow room until you can
properly treat it and be sure that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are not bugs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that a lot of soil that
you purchase comes with free insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people complain about specific
brands having insects in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, all of the soil is eventually
stored in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever brand you choose, if it's Fox
Farms, if it's Roots Organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's whoever else, those are just the
first two I thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's brand A, brand B, and brand C,
they're all made by different companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they're all put on a truck and
they are all sent to whatever king fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro supply in whatever place,
and they're all stored in one warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: there until they're shipped out to smaller
warehouses, to smaller warehouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: to retail stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all shipped to one place,
and in that one place, I imagine it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: a fucking bug farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every thrip and fungus net and spider mite
is just in there plotting to take over
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when new soil comes, you have to pay
attention to what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention that in the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be clean and pay the fuck attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were like, hey,
what about ladybugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't I use ladybugs in my garden to help
keep pests away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs are really cute, but they are not
that aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that they eat enough
problematic bugs to be worth their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get some ladybugs, release them
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a bunch of photography because
they're really cute, and then in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, get out the shop vac and vacuum
up all the dead goddamn ladybugs because
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them are going to die within the
first 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really not that useful,
in my opinion, in an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they die, they stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You step on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them in your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, I don't really think a
praying mantis is too beneficial in a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mostly eat things like aphids and
soft bodied insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't really go after too many spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't that aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is if you are going to
employ predator insects, it is way more
[SPEAKER_00]: worth your time, your budget, and your
energy to research and purchase the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct predatory insect for your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every insect that I mention in these
problem episodes, I'm going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: include a predatory insect that will
control that pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I'll do a full episode focused
on beneficial insects and predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, I'll just include one or two
predators for each problem that we face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you are looking to employ and
use predator mites and an integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management system and go the organic
route, I can fully endorse a company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's A-R-B-I-C-O Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available online at
Arbico-Organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sponsored by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one simple catalog, this is the early
spring 2017 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes beneficial insects and mites
to combat almost any problem I could
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine in a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mite predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are whitefly parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are aphid parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy anything from ladybugs and
praying mantises to minute pirate bugs to
[SPEAKER_00]: assassin bugs, which we will talk about in
the IPM episode, which I do have coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, my point here is
that I do completely endorse Arbico
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, another way that you can pay
attention and notice bugs before they
[SPEAKER_00]: become a problem is yellow and blue sticky
traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said blue also, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people know about the yellow sticky
traps for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about yellow sticky traps for
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason yellow sticky traps are yellow
is because bugs are attracted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellowing leaves are a sign of
weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you were a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to eat through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thick green leaf is crunchy and it
has protection on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little more work to
get to the crunchy, juicy, or that juicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty insides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaf is already yellow,
it's a little bit weak and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: your little fangs right through it and get
in there and suck out the juices and get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bugs are programmed to want to head for
those yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang those yellow sticky traps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put one kind of low near the
bottom of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put one kind of in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have those yellow sticky traps
around to let me know if bugs are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see insects gathering on those,
a couple is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a couple occasionally
because shit flies around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to have a normal bug
flying around, but if you start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: them gather on there, it's time to treat
for whatever bug you see gathering on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be a fungus gnat if
it's something flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue ones, put those lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue sticky cards, put those lower
near your soil and they will let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're getting thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a good indicator of leaf miners
and thrips and other soil bound insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sticky traps are certainly a good
way to let you know that insects are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another good way to know that you've
got bugs, flying bugs will stick to your
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light reflectors, they heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got glass on there, that'll heat
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere there will be bugs stuck to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see little black bugs or little
white bugs, that means you've got fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats or white flies that you have got to
treat for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are really simple ways and
indicators that you have got problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple ways to prevent problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to work our way into talking
about preventing and eradicating and
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying more garden issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start today with white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flies are more ugly than anything,
but what white flies do is they make your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will slow down the growth of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make your plants weak and tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will certainly diminish your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will diminish the quality of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flies like to stick their little
teeth into your plants and suck the sap
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your plants and then they fly
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they land back on your plants and
they shit all over your plants and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: little honeydew streaks on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make your plants weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you try to take photos,
your photos are fucking ugly because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got white flies in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got white fly shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really easy to identify a white
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: White fly identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are little white bugs that fly
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know they're there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see them, the best way to
check for them, shake the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shake the plant, shake the
foliage, white flies will take off flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, look around the
light, shake the plants and look toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the light because the little bugs want to
fly right at the light when you shake
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll just fly around for a
couple of seconds and they'll land right
[SPEAKER_00]: back on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an easy way to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to prevent white flies is a
clean, dry, sealed grow room and also low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flies thrive and reproduce in
temperatures over 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to keep it closer to 75,
77 degrees in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will slow down the white fly
production if they do get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like I was talking about earlier,
clear out all of the plant debris that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead leaves and stuff, get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the last episode, I talked about
using fine dust filters and HEPA filters
[SPEAKER_00]: on all of your ducting or on your intakes
or on your outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have some sort of ducting on
all your ins and outs and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your vents are covered so that the
white flies can't travel through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great ways to prevent white
flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you know how to spot them and you
know how to prevent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, should you get them, let's talk about
ways to get rid of white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about a little bit ago,
yellow sticky traps are a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: start catching the white flies,
but you're only going to get a small
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of what's there, just the ones
that fly to the yellow sticky traps,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the dumb ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dumb ones are going to fly right to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smart ones are going to stay there and
they're going to keep breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that you can get rid of them
is to shake the plants and when they fly
[SPEAKER_00]: up, simply use your shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this before in gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this in personal gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this also in commercial
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shake the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the plant and just use the wand on
the shop vac and as they fly out,
[SPEAKER_00]: just suck them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to fly right out of the
plant and then they're going to fly right
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe keep the shop vac up toward the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just suck them right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the plant, keep sucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chase them around, suck them up until
you're bored, until your arms go tired or
[SPEAKER_00]: until they quit flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whichever one you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out the shop vac and shop vac the
shit out of those white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also things you can do, you can apply
sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use neem oil would work to help
you get rid of your white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrethrum sprays will help you get rid of
your white flies and spinosad sprays will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you get rid of your white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that are up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use the evergreen pyrethrum
spray, it seems to be a very versatile
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray the leaves, you can do a
soil drench and that will get rid of most
[SPEAKER_00]: of your insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think two or three applications of the
evergreen pyrethrums will get rid of most
[SPEAKER_00]: insects to tell you the truth,
but that is up to you if it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got a very small garden
and a very light case of white flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a safer soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ed Rosenthal makes his own type of
soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple products like that are great to use
if you've got a light infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also keep in mind like I mentioned in
every episode, everything you spray on
[SPEAKER_00]: your leaves is going to end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to apply essential oils
or botanical extract oils, those are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to end up in your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on making hash, if you're
making BHO, if you're making water hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff will end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up tasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have a health effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what product you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the long-term effects of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that stuff in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you can use to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of white flies is
[SPEAKER_00]: white fly parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are one, two, three different types
of white fly parasites available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbico magazine, and they are all very
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white fly parasite I would recommend
to you is called the Ancarcia formosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually little wasps that fly
around your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eat the shit out of white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my quick talk
on how to get rid of white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the best way to get rid of white
flies is to prevent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your clothes clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been to another grow,
keep your grow room sealed up and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your yellow sticky traps hung up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the little fuckers don't get
in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, one thing I should mention,
a common way that I have discovered pests
[SPEAKER_00]: in gardens is through photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a huge cannabis photography
enthusiast, a shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to follow my Instagram,
I am irey underscore genetics on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a ton of cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my recent posts have gotten nearly
500 likes so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 480 something likes on a couple of
posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to check that out,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But photography is how I discover a lot of
issues and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll snap a picture at a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll zoom in real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll snap a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw the disc in the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll open it up on the computer screen and
zoom in thinking that I've got the most
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll notice that there are some
white flies or some fungus gnats or some
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids just crunched up in a corner on one
of these buds that I did not even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ruined my photo, but at least now I
know that there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something I need to treat for
something I need to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a good camera,
if you've got a decent camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could probably do this with your
iPhone or Android camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you suspect you've got a problem,
take some pictures, zoom in, look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures when you zoom in and you may
reveal some problems you were unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
17 minutes here, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'm going to take a couple of
giant dabs and then I will be right back
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to talk about aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back and I
am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed the music we were
listening to during the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: The song I played was called Fat Spliffs
by a band called Slightly Stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of my reggae friends are
familiar with Slightly Stupid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you haven't heard of them,
check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will dig them.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the break, you guys, I took some
gigantic dabs of some distillate and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to talk about how much I enjoy
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is probably the most cost
effective way for me to medicate the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take large dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get more medicinal effect
off of one giant dab than I would three
[SPEAKER_00]: little dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took the same amount of hash,
if you took let's just say a half gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would smoke a half gram dab by itself
instead of breaking it into three small
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if I smoked those three
small dabs back to back, like inhale,
[SPEAKER_00]: blow it out, heat the rig up again,
do it again, blow out the dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat the rig up again, smoke it in,
blow it out, do it again, I think those
[SPEAKER_00]: three dabs back to back would not get me
as high as one single half gram dab would
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I took the same half grab,
broke it down into three pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: took them all, or took one giant dab,
I'd get way better medication off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: half gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to take giant dabs and I like to
do it frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take two or three dabs at a time
when I take a dab break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll take four or five dabs at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shatter is the most cost effective way
for me to get the medicine I need for the
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take big dabs very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I need a little extra,
when I just want to do something extra to
[SPEAKER_00]: my head, you guys, this distillate is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit expensive so you can't
get down on it, you can't spoil yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to spend a little
extra money at the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend a nice glass vial of
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I like to do, I heat up the
banger, I heat the banger a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, or the nail, whichever you're using,
or the e-nail, the e-nail is already on,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to a little bit hot and then let it
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just take the torch and just
barely heat the tip of the glass syringe,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the distillate comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just barely tap the plunger
and it'll just push, I think three drops
[SPEAKER_00]: of distillate is a good dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I like to go four or five if I'm
trying to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go big, go like seven or
eight or 10 drops of the distillate into
[SPEAKER_00]: the banger and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one or two drops, two or three
drops would get most people choking and
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really starting to fall in love with
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I'm going to quit rambling about
distillate and concentrates and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are very common in cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love warm environments and warm
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you find them in a lot of ganja
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you find them in a lot of
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about identifying aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are about the size of a piece of
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen aphids plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a piece of rice,
maybe just a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pear shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids come in many different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have seen aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen white aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen orange aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen green aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen aphids that are a reddish brown
color, almost the color of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids come in many different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids like to hang out on the bottom
sides of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they like to congregate at the
bottom sides of the leaves, usually kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of where they've got some protection where
they can hide from predators and light and
[SPEAKER_00]: you and the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen aphids right where the bud,
at the top bud, where the leaves come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bud and kind of make like a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are coming out of the bud and
curling up because the bud was really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and right in that little chilling
area where the leaves and bud made
[SPEAKER_00]: contact, there was a nice little colony of
aphids just chilling and living right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long they had been there,
but they were there for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids like to hang out in a lot of
different places on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check often and they also
breed very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're paying attention for
aphids also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids, the problem with aphids is they
are leaf suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to bite into your leaf and suck
out the juices just like all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: damn pests for your gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get up under the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They poke little holes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start sucking out the leaf juices and
all the life out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants start looking like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your plants are getting weak and
they're susceptible to other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also gonna yield less.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times if an aphid problem gets
out of control, you'll start seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves start to curl and wilt and look
like they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have been beat to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been chewed up by the aphids
so bad that they're not even gonna try to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just gonna curl up and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk about how to prevent
yourself from getting aphids in your ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most other pests, we can avoid
getting them by having filtration,
[SPEAKER_00]: dust filters, and HEPA filters on your
intake and your outgoing vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need a clean grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about a clean grow room,
but every leaf, every piece of debris is a
[SPEAKER_00]: place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also something you can really think
about for aphids, you need clean clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go on a hike, if you were around
plants outside, if it is warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: please change your clothes before you go
into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my co-workers talked about taking
their dog for a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They posted pictures on Instagram all
about taking their dog for a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stopped by the grow to say hello and
see if we wanted lunch on their way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days later, that garden had aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't wanna blame that dog for
running through a bush, getting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car, putting aphids on my friend,
my friend coming to the grow and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, you can tell in my heart
that that's what I think fucking happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not go to a grow after you've
been out hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not come to a grow after you've been
playing with your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pets are huge carriers of
garden pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there running around in
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're low to the ground where the bugs
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the garden pests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rubbing up against plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are where plant pests live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna bring home predatory
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to bring home spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna bring home thrips and
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be very careful with your
clothing, your shoes, and your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way to prevent aphids in your
garden is to check for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they're already there,
you're gonna see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to prevent an infestation is to
check for them very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to check and prevent
any type of pest infestation is to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One sign that you have got an aphid
problem is ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got ants in your grow room,
you have probably got aphids also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants and aphids often come together in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got one, you've probably got
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants are easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually gonna write it down right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I even wrote it down,
so that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about ways to eradicate
aphids should they show up in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we talk about this quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step that you can do if you
choose to is you can spray products on
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many things you can spray for
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about, of course,
the obvious, neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil will get rid of the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't wanna be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky, it smells like shit,
it tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aphids don't wanna hang out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of applications of neem oil
should get rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're in flower, you do not
want to spray neem oil on flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flowering plants,
keep in mind, I say it all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you spray on your buds and your
leaves is going to end up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big, fat, swollen buds,
they're going to act like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna spray neem oil on there and
it's going to absorb and hang onto a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna concentrate it and you'll
actually see the neem oil float on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to think about what you're
gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make a lot of
concentrates, these sprays may not be for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to use sprays,
pyrethrum sprays work well to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, have been endorsing the
Evergreen brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another brand that's quite
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing as Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use cinnamon oil, you can use
clove oils, you can use a product made by
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal called Zero Tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these products will help you to get
rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you to choose how strongly you
want to attack these pests and also how
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh of a chemical you want to apply to
the plants that you are loving and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are growing to use as medicine for
yourself or other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another method we can use to get rid of
our aphids is a beneficial fungus called
[SPEAKER_00]: Buveria bassiana, which is actually sold
as a product called Botanagard 22WP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's spelled B-O-T-N-I-G-A-R-D,
and it's 22WP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit expensive, but it will
certainly work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beneficial fungus I keep
speaking of that can be applied to treat a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of garden insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you can find it, of course,
at Arbeco-Organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize it would be for sale on
that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not looking for it on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a quick Google search to see where
we could purchase it so I could share it
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, and the first place that came up
was Arbeco Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm sure they will not sponsor
me because I'm a cannabis podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let them know if you do shop with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you heard about them
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: through Ross Dejef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've talked about how to get rid of
these aphids on your plants if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in flower and you've got giant
buds, I would never recommend spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: products on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray something that's
going to leave a flavor or possibly cause
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of long-lasting health effect
that we don't even know about for years to
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't want to spray the plants,
what's the next option?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to bring out the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is where ladybugs are
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs do love to eat this shit out of
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a really cool picture in
Ed Rosenthal's book of a ladybug just
[SPEAKER_00]: devouring an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the ladybugs do come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs are actually useful for getting
rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the praying mantis I discredited
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is actually really good at getting rid
of aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ladybugs, the praying mantis,
those would be the first steps to getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of aphids in your cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can bring out aphid parasites and
aphid predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phidias colimani is a well-known aphid
parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several aphid predators
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them prefer certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to work with the
predators and the parasites, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got the proper and appropriate
conditions for these insects so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can thrive and destroy your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do that is
completely free and completely organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's safe and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can simply remove leaves or you can
remove buds that are infested with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop it off, put it in a trash bag,
seal the trash bag, put that in a sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can away from the grow and you will
have manually eliminated the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to mention that I
forgot to write down, but I just thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as I was talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I have seen aphids on the stems
of cannabis plants moving up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: just traveling around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product called stylet oil will coat the
stems of the plants and it will leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: like an undesirable place for these aphids
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out a product called stylet oil,
dilute it heavily, apply it to your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will keep away most of your
garden pests, especially these aphids and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cannabis community,
I want to thank you for listening to part
[SPEAKER_00]: two of preventing, identifying and
eradicating common garden pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we've only covered insects,
but once we cover the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis pest insects, we are going to
work our way into identifying other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the garden, such as plants
that are too dry and too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll teach you how to identify overfed and
underfed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about calcium and magnesium
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of things planned for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you subscribe and stick around for
all of those episodes.
