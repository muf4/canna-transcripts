[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people have been asking for old
episodes of the podcast that are no longer
[SPEAKER_06]: available in the iTunes and Stitcher feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I decided to put old episodes together in
large chunks and throw them back into the
[SPEAKER_06]: feed so that you can enjoy them without
interrupting the current podcast schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get into the old episodes,
there are a couple of things I should tell
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Up until episode 50, the show was called
the iGrowCulture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed the name to Grow From Your Heart
at episode 50.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I should make a disclaimer that I
have learned a lot in 180 episodes of
[SPEAKER_06]: podcasting, so some of my ideas and
opinions at the start of the show may be
[SPEAKER_06]: strongly different from my opinions now
and in the future, so don't hold anything
[SPEAKER_06]: against me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you guys, episode one is probably
quite embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even listen to it, so I hope you
do listen to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot wait to hear your comments on
iTunes, and I cannot wait to hear your
[SPEAKER_06]: tweets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you tweet me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, there's episodes
one, two, and three of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the very first episode of the
iGrowCulture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, my mic is blowing out
real bad, but we'll fix that later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to thank you guys for tuning in
to the very first episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the chuckles over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabs will do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabs will do that, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is already fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much fun today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're dabbing out on some... What do we
got?
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew it, and my buddy over here,
my buddy Kevin from Elevated
[SPEAKER_06]: Concentrations blasted it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waving even though you can't see me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's waving and I'm chuckling at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wave back, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy over here to my left, we call him
MilkyTricomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my buddy White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to fix my mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's blowing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be fixed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been smoking for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to teach people how to grow clean,
safe, and effective medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: After being involved with the plant for so
long, I thought I should become a breeder,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I started doing some pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, I put together my own little
seed company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I've got iRegeneticsColorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you, Kev?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're sneezing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just rubbing the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just rubbing the nose, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you call yourself, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you call yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I call myself Kevin or Kevbro or KJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have very many names.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to know, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make concentrates for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome to me, hopefully for a job
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I founded Elevated Concentrations,
which ... Stay on your microphone so we
[SPEAKER_06]: can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: ... which will be returning very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some issues and had to remove the
marketing, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, we're all golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helping out bros like iRegef.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some good supplies of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: This kid makes some good hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: He keeps me supplied with my head
stashing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you like to smoke, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're smoking flowers, do you like
to smoke indica or sativas?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of blueberry and some
deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a guy that grows some pretty killer
deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually ask people ... I want to ask
people if they're a medical or a rec
[SPEAKER_06]: patient, but I know you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find a line between medicating and
recreating?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I do because it doesn't really
take very much to medicate and to make
[SPEAKER_01]: myself feel better and to help my
ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I just like to get really
stoned, and I go beyond that, and I smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: more than I actually need, but it helps my
head a lot when I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your vibe, your attitude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really helps my aura, and it helps me to
sleep a lot if I over medicate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evenings.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not over medicating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's perfectly medicating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every other sleep drug isn't light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just cannabis works better.
[SPEAKER_06]: That other dude over here to my left,
that's my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to ask him, how long have you
been smoking weed, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I was 15, 14.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somebody's got to do math for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost 32.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the month, I'll be 32,
so 17 years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you consider yourself a medical or a
recreational smoker?
[SPEAKER_04]: For a good chunk of that, it was
completely recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just something fun I did
occasionally with friends, and then I got
[SPEAKER_04]: injured a couple of years ago working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hurt my neck real bad and messed up some
of the discs.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my neck, it had some nerve-generated
pain is what the fancy doctor folks would
[SPEAKER_04]: call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis works a lot better than the pain
pills they had me on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really my personal entry into the
medical world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it's both, I would say, but the
regular use of cannabis is definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: medical rather than recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was recreational, I'd probably hit
some joints on the weekend or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the definite consistent use is medical
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a line between when the
pain stops and any sort of enjoyment or
[SPEAKER_04]: entertainment begins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That line's easy to feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell when, okay, my pain's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do what I've got to do for the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you can feel the pain slowly coming
back and go medicate a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pain goes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: The line before you become intoxicated is
really easy to walk for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I get home and want to unwind,
definitely recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs for me are recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go right past medicated into happy
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good line to draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs for me are very medical because I
have a lot of respiratory issues and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking the herb really gets to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking a lot of weed really gets to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing the dabs and not having to smoke so
much and now that we've learned about
[SPEAKER_01]: de-waxing and all that stuff and getting a
lot of that plant matter out of it has
[SPEAKER_01]: really helped me to not be congested or
wheeze all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if I'm doing quality dabs but I
notice if you do some dirty stuff it kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of hinders that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: He started coming to the dispensary I
worked at.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a lot of roles there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He got to see the evolution of dirty stuff
come to what it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember some of the junk we used to see
come to that dispensary?
[SPEAKER_06]: People would try to pass off as ear wax or
VHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were calling it butter because it was
goopy and syrupy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I was handed ear wax was
black tar in a coke vial.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy said this is ear wax hash and
handed it to me and I looked him in the
[SPEAKER_04]: face.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was new at the shop so my automatic
response to insult the product that I was
[SPEAKER_04]: just handed had to be gut checked and kind
of held in reserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of nodded and put it back on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't feel like I could say anything
there but good lord the quality of hash in
[SPEAKER_04]: the last six years is light years ahead of
where it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff little Kev brings back for me is
freaking impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to thank a lot of the whole
community for doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone sharing knowledge with each other
and being fairly open with each other and
[SPEAKER_01]: people being willing to read and learn and
gain that knowledge has really made that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard you say something interesting the
other day and I want you to get closer to
[SPEAKER_06]: the mic just for this one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to get into hash, what's the
first step?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to make hash, sorry not get into
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to make my own VHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to a school or a library and grab a
basic organic chemistry book and sit down
[SPEAKER_01]: and read that shit and then introduce the
cannabis later once you understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're dealing with and how to respect it.
[SPEAKER_06]: See I think that's a good approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that read some forums and
don't watch a single video until you have
[SPEAKER_01]: an understanding and you feel like you can
do it on your own and make a batch or two
[SPEAKER_01]: if you feel confident and you have done
those steps and done the reading and
[SPEAKER_01]: gained the knowledge and then watch videos
after you've already tried it because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much stupid shit that people do
in those two minute videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making a good batch of dabs doesn't take
two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what your process is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I recommend doing the reading
and the research.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've waited two or three days for this
dude to bring me back dabs and it seems
[SPEAKER_06]: like the longer I wait the better they
are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: By all means people do your homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason people are getting hurt
trying to make dabs is because they heard
[SPEAKER_04]: about it from a friend and the friend
didn't really know what they were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about and then they ran to the parts
store, bought a bunch of flammable
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals, took them into an enclosed
space and set all the fumes on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally the dumbest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do any research at all you learn
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn how to not blow yourself up in
the first two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about respecting what you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't blast indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a hash maker but my number one
piece of advice is do not blast indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for you Kev, what kind of mark do you
want to leave on the cannabis industry or
[SPEAKER_06]: the society or cannabis world?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to just keep continuing with the
main attitude that most of us have and
[SPEAKER_01]: just continue that positive outlook and
that positive view from the people as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep gaining that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing everything as best I can with the
most knowledge and learning everything as
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to light, as everything's
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just always keep up with that and share
that with the people around me because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how we get better is by sharing the
knowledge that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we prevent blowing up is by
sharing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're doing a lot of work in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not a grower, you're not a hash
maker but you're on the other end.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the computer nerd that we all need.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an activist on that end.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do a lot of stuff on the ... Should I
say where you do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do a lot of stuff from what I know on the
Huff Post.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you tweeting a lot of cool stuff
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an activist in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of why I wanted to have you on
my first show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do that stuff and we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm busy in the grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole cast is making hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need you to speak for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're well written, well spoken.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to think of the last five years as
working on a doctorate in cannabis but
[SPEAKER_04]: other people might call it unemployed or
self-employed or weed-employed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're kind of employed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of employed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of and kind of employed at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of mark do you want to leave?
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're gone, when the earth blows up
and somebody reads a book about Mike,
[SPEAKER_06]: what do you want it to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it would be amazing if my name
was in some of the history books as part
[SPEAKER_04]: of this huge experiment going on in
Colorado right now about one of the first
[SPEAKER_04]: big names to do it incredibly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could just put you two in a warehouse
and chain you there for a year,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike run the front, me on the grow,
Kev on the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could just enslave you two and keep
Jeff in the garden and Kev in the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: room and I'd have to chain myself to the
front desk too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can't leave, I can't leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that could happen, my name would fully
be cemented in history as the golden Coors
[SPEAKER_04]: brewery of southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be way cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be way cool to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be way cool to see one of my bros
accomplish that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be so much fun to play king of
the mountain and just sell weed with you
[SPEAKER_04]: two for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to have other people or is it
just the three of us?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to hire a whole bunch
of helpers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we have some Oompa Loompas and what
nots?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll need some of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to teach them better
songs, but yes, I like the idea of Oompa
[SPEAKER_04]: Loompas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little people and or... Dude, I don't care
if we hire... I'll hire anybody,
[SPEAKER_04]: bros.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just eat weed leaves all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat the trim?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of coca leaves, they're just
chewing on weed leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hire a pretty girl to go get you
Rasta Pasta and I don't know what Kevin
[SPEAKER_04]: eats, Anthony's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin will eat Rasta Pasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin wants a Rasta Pasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Rasta Pasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not pay for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, that was a free promo.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a meat eater and want a weed
job, I suppose you should call me so I
[SPEAKER_04]: have somebody to go to lunch with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Mike is not... Well, Kevin eats the
carnivore stuff, but I'm one of those
[SPEAKER_06]: hippy types, y'all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't eat any animals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a bunch of people that just met us or
just tuned in.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't mean grilled cheese by that,
folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't count as a veggie option.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like some falafel, some hippy shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a topic we want to discuss.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put it back on a serious note
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: A recent article that came out written by
Ricardo Baca in the Denver Post,
[SPEAKER_06]: an independent Denver Post study of
several marijuana infused products shows
[SPEAKER_06]: wide variances in THC levels and edibles
versus labeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: What that means is apparently they
acquired some edibles and they took them
[SPEAKER_06]: to a testing facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: They took them to Steep Hill Halent Labs
and they tested them and the labels did
[SPEAKER_06]: not match the test findings.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read a little bit further for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a big breath before I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a couple dabs before the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about the wobbly voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to read out loud on a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, as one of the largest producers
of marijuana infused edibles in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. J's Hash and Fusion makes chocolates,
caramels, and candies, but many of the
[SPEAKER_06]: company's products contain only a minute
fraction of the THC promised on Dr. J's
[SPEAKER_06]: labels, according to independent tests
organized by the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_06]: One Dr. J's milk chocolate stars bar
labeled for 1,000 milligrams of THC had,
[SPEAKER_06]: and pay attention here, 0.37 milligrams of
valued psychoactive component,
[SPEAKER_06]: according to three tests conducted by
Steep Hill Halent of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_06]: a state licensed marijuana testing
facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another Dr. J's, another popular Dr. J's
chocolate bar, the 100 milligram winter
[SPEAKER_06]: mint flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the page is refreshing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me scroll back down.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Winter mint flavor tested similarly in two
experiments showing 0.28 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_06]: THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, these chocolate bars cost
about 10 bucks plus tax, and they promise
[SPEAKER_06]: to have 100 milligrams of THC in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you basically just bought a Hershey
bar, or I can't, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't say a brand name.
[SPEAKER_06]: You bought a regular chocolate bar off of
the shelf is basically what you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least the regular dollar chocolate bar
up by the register at the Quickway is
[SPEAKER_04]: standardized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, there's always going to be kind
of what you ordered.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff they're cooking in their
kitchens, if they can't get the THC that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're trying to put in it, does it even
taste like food, or does it just taste
[SPEAKER_04]: like boot leather?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, at those numbers, you need 100 of
those things to get one normal 25
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram dose, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, you're dying of diabetes
trying to treat whatever you can treat
with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's $1,000 in edibles you need for one
dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have diabetes,
yeah, you're going to be fat and funky.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to continue on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says they need to work on their process
as Joseph Evans, laboratory director at
[SPEAKER_06]: Steep Hill Halent, who's a really cool
guy, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the guy at Steep Hill Halent.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been attacked over this,
and everything I've heard and known about
[SPEAKER_04]: Steep Hill Halent is all Gold Star type
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard anybody whine about
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know those guys personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't pay me a penny.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're business partners of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my products tested with Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grimy Gatsby, Joseph Evans, and Addison
Demora are the three guys that I'm friends
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're straight up dudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no reason to lie, no reason to
make anything up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do good business.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making our industry much better.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're improving every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steep Hill Halent, big love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every area of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from me, from Kevin too,
thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't pay for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is just genuine appreciation
from the community to the testing labs
[SPEAKER_04]: doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joseph says, and check him out,
Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's enough about that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This says they need to work on their
process as Joseph Evans, laboratory
[SPEAKER_06]: director at Steep Hill Halent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that it's irresponsible,
but it's non-professional, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: much how I feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: The evolving marijuana industry is still
finding its way in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the evolving aspects is the
testing or lack thereof products.
[SPEAKER_06]: The state marijuana enforcement division
enacted new regulations last week and more
[SPEAKER_06]: changes are to come in May and in October.
[SPEAKER_06]: For people that aren't from Colorado or
aren't familiar with all this,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's some mumbo jumbo in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The marijuana enforcement division,
that is the division that oversees all of
[SPEAKER_06]: the dispensary regulations, rules and
taxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're attached to the IRS.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're able to randomly show up at your
dispensary on any day that business is
[SPEAKER_06]: being conducted.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can open up all your business
records.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can open up all your saves.
[SPEAKER_06]: The boxes where you keep money,
they can open those.
[SPEAKER_06]: They inspect any and every part of the
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cars in the parking lot every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cars in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They go through the bathrooms if they feel
like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they find like a roach or a pipe or
something, you can be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly what they do about
that, but you can be screwed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are strict rules and everything
in these medical and recreational centers
[SPEAKER_06]: are under camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the minute you walk in the door to
the minute you pay, your money is heavily
[SPEAKER_04]: on camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: They require incredibly good cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can zoom in on IDs and stuff with each
of these cameras and read it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they've got their stuff under
control and they're just popping in and
[SPEAKER_06]: inspecting places.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the place that's involved and
responsible for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're coming out with new
regulations all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to get it under control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll continue the article.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as the marijuana industry looks ahead
to the potential of regular mandatory
[SPEAKER_06]: testing, Dr. J's problem seemed deeper
than a bad batch or two.
[SPEAKER_06]: The two bars that both tested for less
than half milligram of THC were purchased
[SPEAKER_06]: two months and 40 miles apart from each
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were separated by 282 batches or
roughly 70,000 units.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this couldn't have been just like a
fluke batch or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was definitely like, what do we call
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is their business model being found
out by the general public.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if 11 of the 12 pop cans in your
12 pack were empty or just full of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're 200 batches apart, that's a
business practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a huge flaw in their business practice
is at minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you produce a hundred batches of
chocolate bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as I can keep talking,
you can get dab the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Fong who made the cool ass
torch that we're using.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I'm going to read a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have something to add to what you were
saying, but I want to read a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more and get this through to this article
before we ran out too much and get
[SPEAKER_06]: distracted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the next thing he has a little header.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, uh, enter enforcement agency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hundreds of customers have complained.
[SPEAKER_06]: About Dr. J's products.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least three recreational pot shops
dropped the brand entirely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Others said they won't carry them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and the grousing has the attention of
the medical marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_06]: division.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to turn on your mics.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing's going to be crazy loud,
but go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can learn how to do it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to drop that torch out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, y'all.
[SPEAKER_06]: An independent post study of several
products showed the THC levels and edibles
[SPEAKER_06]: are never exactly what the package reads.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's never a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's never a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mile highs, candies, watermelon drops
are labeled labeled at a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams of THC, but they actually
contained 17.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a failure in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge failure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredibles mile high mint chocolate bar
advertises 100 milligrams of THC,
[SPEAKER_06]: but instead included 146.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now keep that in your mind for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to read the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to the growing kitchen,
the growing kitchen's chocolate chunk
[SPEAKER_06]: cookie tested at 100 and milligram,
101 milligrams on our products labeled for
[SPEAKER_06]: 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you were one milligram off,
which that's doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big love to the growing kitchen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check those guys out, buy their edibles,
the chocolate chunk cookie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking what it's at.
[SPEAKER_06]: So something I've said to keep in your
head, 146 milligrams and an edible that's
[SPEAKER_06]: listed at a hundred, you're getting one
and a half times your dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay with that, but you and me are,
but the general public, that's I,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am registered caregiver for five
patients and I have two people that if I
[SPEAKER_06]: fed them that they would probably get mad
at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could definitely, if I had stuff to do
that day and I was expecting say half of a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred milligram dose to start my day off
with, and I really got 75 instead of 50 by
[SPEAKER_04]: half of that, that could mess up a good
portion of my day.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A regulated tested product.
[SPEAKER_06]: What if this company gave me a Vicodin and
I just thought I took, it's a 750
[SPEAKER_06]: milligram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost just took, what was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: A thousand milligrams, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably, I'm going to be fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go to work now.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1250.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody you were, you guys get the damn
point, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm with you entirely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a math bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: I already forgot the numbers I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is a product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Product of the industry being on the
fringe still.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's we're only months removed from this
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good thing to keep in mind.
Completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that went to school and learn
the skills that it takes to put an exact
[SPEAKER_04]: number of milligrams of THC in a little
fun size candy bar haven't moved into this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and then numbers great enough to
really provide awesome product standards
[SPEAKER_04]: across the board with edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly who came in one above and one off?
[SPEAKER_04]: The growing kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: The growing kitchen has got somebody who
really knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that the folks in charge of
making the capsules and the oils of
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlotte's Web that were given to the
kids with seizures have also taken great
[SPEAKER_04]: lengths.
[SPEAKER_04]: The standard either dose exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly other people haven't bothered to
do any of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're trying, but I mean,
a lot of this stuff came from mom and pop
[SPEAKER_06]: operations that had to grow and expand
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: True, but if you're shooting for 100 and
you're getting 15, either you're a moron
[SPEAKER_04]: or your math is seriously flawed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I skip the paragraph where the owner
of that company argued saying that they
[SPEAKER_06]: had to be better?
[SPEAKER_06]: I may have skipped a paragraph.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if I did them skimming
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Immediately when the story broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do you want to keep reading?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, keep going because you're going to
cover what I missed.
[SPEAKER_04]: When this story broke the first day it was
published on the Denver Post and in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry responded immediately with
their lying or their testing methods were
[SPEAKER_04]: off or some other nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's his quote.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, I would be in shock if those
tests were accurate, said Dr. J's CEO.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to butcher your last name.
[SPEAKER_06]: His name's Tom.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on top of the business in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be in business this long if we
weren't doing things right 99% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 99% of the people for the last
year just didn't know what they were
buying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm speechless on your answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I paused and nodded and nobody on a
podcast can see me pause and nod.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go back to if it was any other product.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody told you that two out of four
Fords just burst into flames on the road,
[SPEAKER_04]: would you ever even consider buying one
again?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been looking at a Ford.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to buy a Ford.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true Ford.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've driven many Fords for many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for not suing us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't produce a standardized
product, you need to rethink what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing and reset your kitchen up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly, they're failing miserably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, anyone in Colorado can just walk into
a testing facility and say, I think this
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate bar's bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saved two bites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Test it for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's going to cost them a few
bucks, but if I go to- Probably cost you
[SPEAKER_06]: about $100, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get more in a lawsuit saying,
I've tried to buy my medicine from Dr. J,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Dr. J shafted me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you a lot of dispensaries are going
to drop Dr. J before too long,
[SPEAKER_06]: and who's going to buy it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be surprised if that company is
operating under that management and under
[SPEAKER_04]: that name in six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is the day after St. Patrick's Day.
[SPEAKER_06]: March 18th.
[SPEAKER_06]: March 18th.
[SPEAKER_06]: This won't go out for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to put a couple of
episodes together before I throw them out
[SPEAKER_06]: there, get my shit together before I run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting back into the article,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado marijuana industry leader Dixie
Elixirs tested at 60 milligrams of THC
[SPEAKER_06]: with its Dixie rolls in the post-study,
which are labeled at 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 60% of what you're paying for.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you stopped at a fast food restaurant
on your way here, where would you have
[SPEAKER_06]: gone to get a drink or some sort of
beverage?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do a lot of the fast food joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say Taco Bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to say Burger Bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to make up a spot called
Burger Bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you stopped at fucking Burger Bell and
you took off the lid and your drink was
[SPEAKER_06]: only three quarters of 60% of the way
full, you'd go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be like, hey, can you spit in this
and fill it the rest of the way up?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know they're going to spit in that
fucker if you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was any other industry, none of
these things would be acceptable at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of these things would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: None whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got 60% of your dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm proud of us for stepping up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud of somebody for stepping up and
doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to the Denver Post for doing it and
the Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll continue.
[SPEAKER_06]: While we were disappointed to learn of the
post-test results, we also know that
[SPEAKER_06]: testing can vary significantly from one
lab to the next.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hard to say when you're dabbed out
and reading quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dixie Elixir's CEO Joe Hoda said,
regardless, we will continue to focus on
[SPEAKER_06]: our quality control to be sure all of our
products from edibles to tinctures and
[SPEAKER_06]: topicals reflect agreed upon milligrams of
THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: From here on out, they're going to do
their best, they say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they can regain their shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of freebies somewhere from Dr.
J's.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to give a shit ton of
stuff away, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really hoping this shakes through the
whole industry in Colorado from the
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles companies that have clearly been
doing some shady business for the last
[SPEAKER_04]: several years down to the shops that have
been saying they've got their Tora Bora
[SPEAKER_04]: tested 10% THC, 10% CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been able to claim whatever
without the public having any real
[SPEAKER_04]: recourse to test that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your beer says it was at 3% and it
could be at any percent, that causes real
[SPEAKER_04]: problems in society.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having this being standard is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the awesomeness that comes
with legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this was possible five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the revolution, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the knowledge that's coming out
now is possible because of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have these labs like Steep Hill
that can test stuff for us and give us
[SPEAKER_01]: good results and standardized results.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a tour of their facility and
it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Independent testing labs, one of the first
thing that sprang up alongside the legal
[SPEAKER_04]: weed industry in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool to see that that became
a foundational component to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sad that the edible companies
have done such a bad job standardizing so
[SPEAKER_04]: far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they can't now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe now they know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mic sounds weird in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if it sounds goofy to your
ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll fix that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fix it in post.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll continue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, but of the 10 edibles tested in
the exclusive post report, no edible had
[SPEAKER_06]: the THC level problems of Dr. J's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Evan said, you're taking less than a
milligram of THC in a product that says
[SPEAKER_06]: 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: Evan said, if people have no confidence in
the industry, then there could be a sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of backlash against the whole legal
marijuana movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to finish the article.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one paragraph.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, how can these numbers be so
disparate?
[SPEAKER_06]: While there's been much discussion over
testing guidelines, it's still a voluntary
[SPEAKER_06]: action for growers and makers of marijuana
infused products or MIPs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I just want to give credit to who's
the homie that wrote it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ricardo Baca from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what they tested was Bangfire
Chocolate Bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a tastiness right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It listed 180 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually had 156 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot closer than so many other ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give that one a six.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give that one a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You missed it by a little bit,
but I mean, compared to the competition,
[SPEAKER_06]: what the hell can I say?
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dr. J's bars, the milk chocolate,
listed 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess how many, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.4.
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.4.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridonkulous, if that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a peon.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what if you bought that?
What?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, people are relying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. J's Star bars, winter mint chocolate,
0.3.
[SPEAKER_06]: They claim to have a hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. J's Star bars, white chocolate,
claim to have a hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, they stepped it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got five out of a hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their Dr. J's highest test score
was five percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's why I was excited for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five milligrams, not five percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's five percent because it's a hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's accurate for that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. J's jelly stones, they list a hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got 0.2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, if you owed me a hundred dollars and
I showed up, what's that, 20 cents?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I showed up with 20 cents and threw it
on the table, would you punch me in the
[SPEAKER_06]: damn mouth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not for the mouth for 20,
but point well taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's irresponsible business practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: If any other industry did this,
if your new car showed up with no seats,
[SPEAKER_04]: no tires, no engine, no brakes,
like come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fell in love.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked at it as I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in love with weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been smoking weed for years before I
should admit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fell in love with cannabis years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I became an employee manager.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran it a spin three.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fell in love with watching people fall
in love with cannabis and watch it improve
[SPEAKER_06]: their lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm involved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I breed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like watching people feel better.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people I'm responsible for,
that I'm a caregiver, they have fucked up
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions that I see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm their friends and I watch them get
better consuming the medicine that I
[SPEAKER_06]: produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm in it for.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're producing an edible that's
listed to have a hundred milligrams and
[SPEAKER_06]: only has five, you're taking money from a
sick fucking person, first of all.
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter who you are, you work hard for
your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what you do, now you work hard
for your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, most of us work hard for our money.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some people that- Some of us
work less hard than others, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us have mommy and daddy's money,
but that's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're ripping people off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're taking money out of hardworking
people that trusted you to take care of
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they aren't medicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about people like Brave Michaela?
[SPEAKER_06]: What about people that needed medicine?
[SPEAKER_06]: What about people like Cash Hyde that rely
on that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to bring up people that have passed
and people that are sick, but those people
[SPEAKER_06]: needed medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you give them
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine that was not what we promised to
give them, they're not going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: medicated and they're going to get sick
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll go into remission and we just
ripped them off and gave them cancer all
[SPEAKER_06]: over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not love.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not compassion.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dollar signs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. J, I want to give you guys the
opportunity to redeem yourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't bash you 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't work for your company.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you guys to get it back together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see you come through and
redeem yourselves, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know the Denver Post isn't done
with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: In six months, they're going to do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to send their reporters to
15 or 20 shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to buy up a selection of
edibles from different shops and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to take them back to Steep Hill and
one of the other testing labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This report is coming out again every
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until it comes back with 80 or 90% of the
products tested are scoring right where
[SPEAKER_04]: they should.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Edibles have always been hit or miss,
but when you're working in a kitchen
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to make can of butter or can of oil
and then make them into an edible product
[SPEAKER_04]: for you and a couple of friends,
the process is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being unevenly dispersed throughout the
batch is less important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always been true with edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to make a tray of brownies.
[SPEAKER_04]: One brownie will wreck you for 30 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another brownie won't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're selling it as a medicine and
as a standardized product in the store,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can't waver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your 10 milligrams should always be at 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your 100 should always be at 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, you're going to kill people on
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get up on your mic a little bit,
bro, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff and I had had a conversation right
after he came back from meeting the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: at Steep Hill about how your terpene
molecules and things like that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: dispersed differently throughout your slab
of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, depending on what part of the
slab of hash you give them, it can taste
differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-homogenous sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that could also be true with the
can of butters and the can of oils,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it all gets dispersed differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make it, it is very difficult to
get that completely spread across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin's brought me slabs of hash that
sometimes I get.
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 to 30 grams from him sometimes when he
does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's making the shape of a pie plate or a
frisbee with his hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you who can't see through the
radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to measure how many grams
that was while I did it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we can see the puddles of
different, I don't know if it's terpenoids
[SPEAKER_06]: or flavonoids, or there's another one that
the name just left my head right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paleoids, I think, is what they may be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't identify them by the puddles,
but you could see that there's ... If you
[SPEAKER_06]: dab from different sections, they taste
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like different layers of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like different layers of the pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different oils separating in
different textures.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good defense for these edibles,
and I agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they cooked them tipped up this way,
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's vertically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they cooked them vertically,
and all the goodies ran down to the bottom
[SPEAKER_06]: bite, and they tested the top bite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those edibles are not ... 100 milligrams
is too much of a dose for the recent
[SPEAKER_06]: person I've been treating.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too much for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs half of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he expects to get half of it when he
splits it in half, he doesn't think,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get fucking roller coaster
the first time and just be bored the
[SPEAKER_06]: second time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the effect we're talking about is
what's causing Dr. J's test results,
[SPEAKER_04]: that means that there are Dr. J's edibles
out there with several hundred milligrams
[SPEAKER_04]: of THC per dose rather than the single
hundred they're advertising, which is just
[SPEAKER_04]: as unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's the case with Dr.
J's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is probably the case with some of the
others that we're testing at half or
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it was just a point I thought
I'd bring up to think about because that
[SPEAKER_01]: is part of the equation in some of them
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are working with white chocolate star
bars and winter mint chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that shit's stirring up and it's
getting a little puddle on one side,
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe it's stuck to the wrapper.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to give them a little bit of ...
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe these idiots are cooking it all off
in their ovens.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little too hot or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they had a rogue employee,
rip them off.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're doing this bad ... Maybe Dr.
J's company, like the good folks there,
[SPEAKER_06]: have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's one ... It takes one bad
apple in your whole company to fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: produce a whole 7,000 units of fucked up
chocolate bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowing the size of Dixie Elixir and Chiba
Chews and some of those other major
[SPEAKER_04]: companies' operations, I can see how their
numbers kind of went all over the place
[SPEAKER_04]: these last couple months because their
distribution quadrupled.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't prepared for the demand
that's hit their companies even a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit blew up here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one knew what was coming, what the
demand would be like.
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, none of these people were
allowed to produce product for the new
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to transfer over up to 15% of
their existing inventory.
[SPEAKER_04]: This caused all sorts of product
interruptions and shortages.
[SPEAKER_04]: In an effort to scramble to catch up,
how much of these test results are due to
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trying to rush it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to rush it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw it coming, but we didn't know it
was going to happen like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the wreck hit, it was so hyped up and
everybody got anxious and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got pumped up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say another thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to scare everybody away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid of dispensaries and
edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one company out of ... I'm going
to read off more brands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Edipure, Lemon Drops, Hard Candies,
listed 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tested at 45.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mile High Candies, Watermelon Drops,
listed 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tested at 17.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dixie Elixirs, Dixie Rolls 100,
listed 60 actual.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a good one for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Kudu Cookies and Cream Chocolate Bar,
listed 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: They came in at 105.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give them props.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like everything on the shelf,
ask the budtender which one people come
[SPEAKER_04]: back and buy a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be on the list,
so we'll get to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their number on this test was
disappointing to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hurt to know a company that I've
supported vocally.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should do math on that because it's
... I mean, I'm not being a smart ass to
[SPEAKER_06]: your answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should do the math though because the
recommended dose is smaller than the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to keep reading and we'll get to
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growing Kitchens, Chocolate Chunk Cookie,
listed 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came in at 101.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mad respect for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredibles Mile High Mint Chocolate Bar,
listed 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came in at 146.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dangerous, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm a pothead.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a pothead.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can handle it, but there are patients
out there and people from Texas that
[SPEAKER_06]: haven't had a lot of edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: People from Texas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mean, but there are people that are
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not ready for what they're going
to get hit with.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I bought an Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to a dispensary looking for Chiba
Chews.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have them and they had
Incredibles on sale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the Mile High Mint and I bought a
... It's a monkey bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that fucking monkey bar,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate them both.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wrecked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really, really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a professional, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: They both had to be overdosed because I
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's Mike's favorite, Chiba Chew Quad
Dose Soft Candies, which is usually my
[SPEAKER_06]: go-to edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I got to go somewhere and eat an
edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say they have 70 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: They came in at 53.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nearly as bad as some of the
other companies on there, but still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the percentage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, you're a math whiz.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 53 divided by 70, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a shortage of ... If you're
paying for 70, you expect 70.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's about 80%.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came in better than a lot of other
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my experience with them is it's a
consistent product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flavor is decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love their Red Hornet Candies,
or their Green Hornet Candies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sad to see that they weren't right
on the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first thing I looked for when
I saw that article came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I scanned for Chiba Chew's results and
went, aw.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey Diaz likes to call them the Chibo
Chew.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chibo Chew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate a freaking Chibo Chew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fucking wrecked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last one on our list is Sweet Stone
Candy Fruit Loops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's listed 50.
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came in at 45.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Claude the Candy Man and
Melissa, the whole Sweet Stone team.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are cool freaking people,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just good audible makers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't pay me to say that,
but they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not a huge operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing millions of units out of
a warehouse, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know their business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't speak for ... You don't know their
business, just know their product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know their product is good and that
Claude is a cool fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that Melissa smiles every time you
wave at her and smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my understanding that they were
smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the smaller guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I see Claude, if you smile at
him and say, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: And high five him, and he will give you a
Claude Bear to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: A Claude Bear a day keeps the haters away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking no, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some tasty shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Claude Bears.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got a big old promo from me,
Claude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, we've gone 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to wrap up the first episode here
and call it a success?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that sounds pretty nifty.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got anything you want to shout out,
give some promos to, Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out Irie Genetics,
Steep Hill Halent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out my buddies at Top Shelf
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you run into any old elevated
concentration stuff on the internet,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might be fun to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the whole cannabis community,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis community.
Word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you just got your ticket for the
Cannabis Cup, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
Two days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get a two day or a one day?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be there both days.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going together, but we will
definitely, you'll see us hanging out
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see us hanging out apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be doing dads.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be smoking balls, smoking fat
joints, saying hi to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be Cannabis cupping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, you got any cool shit to say for the
end of the show?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick to flowers and hash, people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly, edibles don't have a nailed down
yet for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking words from the wise,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I want to thank you guys for joining
me on my first show.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are my bros.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been with me since I was fucking
growing weed in my mom's basement back in
[SPEAKER_06]: the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's trimmed a lot of my weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin's fucking smoked a good portion of
that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been in turn a bunch of it to dads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fino hunting with me and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank everybody that listened,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was our first episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to call it a success.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, we have a Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to hear about something
growing, smoking, something about
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado, if you want to say hi,
if you want to tell me to fuck off,
[SPEAKER_06]: please do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also at Rasta Jeff 420, but that's how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody be good to yourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be good to one another.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm already fucking slurred and stumbling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, take a fat dab for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be really loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too loud, you're too old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he going to come out with his dab song?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a dab song.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got plenty of dab songs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock has a dab songs covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hydro has plenty of dab songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they both have them on lockdown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Hump Day podcast.

iGrowCulture podcast.

[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to dab the fuck out,
I'm over here trying not to cough into the
[SPEAKER_06]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice pre-show dab session over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hanging out on a Wednesday night.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Kevin's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin from Elevated Concentrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a little bit, we're going to play a
phone interview that I did with Addison
[SPEAKER_06]: Demora from Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Kev?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing pretty good, yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing iRE, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured you'd be a good guest to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: The topic tonight is going to be about
hash and when we talk about hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's my favorite topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you sound like you're full of
shit, but when it's hash, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep up on my hash knowledge and
most of my cannabis knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do well.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our group, we have a nice ... We're a
cannabis encyclopedia in our group.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of us has the answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the reason we're gathered here
today, I wanted to talk about the Secret
[SPEAKER_06]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Cup was this past weekend in
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should tell you guys about the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Cup is a pretty exclusive hash
competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: The competition part is invite only.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be invited by Big D.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Big D for hosting a super
sweet exclusive hash event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've competed, Kevin and I have competed
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew a crop and Kevin extracted it and
made pretty tasty dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was satisfied with our results as a
first time competitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too, especially just a year into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice to see where I fit in
and we did well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We placed respectfully, respectively or
respectfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top 10 finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We speak vehiclies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our own language sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll fill you in one day if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear it every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once and again, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Cup is the competition part is
invite only.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go hang out, you just got
to know how to get tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't really advertise a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to know who to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in the loop, you'll end up at
the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way they do it, every competitor
brings his hash to the entry table and
[SPEAKER_06]: they divide it into small samples and
every competitor gets to actually be a
[SPEAKER_06]: judge.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all take dabs of all the stuff that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find it to be a pretty fair competition
because it's judged by the competitors,
[SPEAKER_06]: which keeps it fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just repeated myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who better to judge some hash than a bunch
of hash makers and hash connoisseurs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Judged against your peers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to join again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to participate again this
year, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I receive that email, I'll be entering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big D, if you hear this, I read genetics
and elevated concentrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to come participate in the Secret
Cup again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it was a great time last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fun with all the competitors and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all such great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fun to put our stuff together
and try everybody's dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole dab community is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got musicians that entertain us
while we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got people that come and bring
medicated and non-medicated food that are
[SPEAKER_06]: part of the scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see them at any other events other
than cannabis-related, but I see them at
[SPEAKER_06]: every cannabis-related event, vending
food.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got people that make pipes for us
that are in our groups, like in our
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got people that are making our
extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got clothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got pen companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all friends now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a neat little community industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's what you call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a family, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're honest and real and not a dick,
you're pretty much accepted and
[SPEAKER_01]: well-treated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you are kind of a dick,
we'll let you into the crew because every
[SPEAKER_06]: crew needs a couple of dicks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds really gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dicks out there, but they know
what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a weird segue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of dicks, a lot of people are
frustrated and hating on Steep Hill Halent
[SPEAKER_06]: Labs, but I find what they did to be
legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every sample that runs through the Secret
Cup is tested through a lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: They used Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the representatives, Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also know Addison Demora, Earl Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'm friends with Joe.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's one of the ... I don't know your
official position, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but you're a good bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys are cool guys from the Steep
Hill Halent.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tested every sample that went through
there, and they found some pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting results.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost every single sample that was
entered into the Secret Cup, it would not
[SPEAKER_06]: have passed California standards or
Colorado standards for what they call
[SPEAKER_06]: clean and safe BHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all contained a chemical called
pentane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a gas called pentane,
which is part of butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you ready to play the clip,
bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a clip from Addison Demora.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, are you ready to listen is what I
should have asked.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to play the little clip
with Addison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me pull it up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin and I, we're going to turn off the
microphones and take a couple of dabs,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll listen with you because Kevin
hasn't heard it yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my interview with Addison Demora
from Steep Hill Halent Laboratories.
This is Addison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Addison.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ross and Jeff with iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm calling you from the iGrow Culture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, buddy?
Good, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing with some knobs here,
trying to learn how to record you from the
[SPEAKER_06]: phone and myself at the same time without
blowing something up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you don't die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, bro?
I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sitting in a meeting with Swerve and
Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just talking today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, make sure you tell those dudes I
said hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swerve's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swerve's a good bro of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you mean Adam Dunn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Adam Dunn the Adam you're hanging out
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Adam's with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually in the other room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just went to the conference room here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, make sure you tell both of those
guys that Ross and Jeff from iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_06]: says hello.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send your love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's your official title over there
at Steep Hill Halent?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under, as well as the Chief Operations
Officer for the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good title.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, excuse my voice here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 420 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just participating in 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 420 all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the time, especially when you got
Swerve and Adam Dunn in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you guys are having a good time over
there.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, bro, the main reason I wanted to get
you on my show, this is the second episode
[SPEAKER_06]: of my podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wanted to get you on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a big member of our community.
[SPEAKER_06]: My topic was the Secret Cup happened last
weekend, and Steep Hill Halent had the
[SPEAKER_06]: honor of testing every sample that was
entered into the Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I've read, you guys have
discovered pentane or other contaminants
[SPEAKER_06]: in nearly every sample that was entered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that maybe you can educate
myself and my listeners about what you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys do and what you discovered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me what some of the other
contaminants may be that you're looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to use either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very smart move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we added pentane, when we ran the
tests before
[SPEAKER_02]: we did our homework beforehand,
we didn't see anybody that was testing for
pentane.
[SPEAKER_02]: We added it because we knew it would be
there
to protect your wounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it does is it ups the
[SPEAKER_02]: ant to the
vat that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get to relearn making hash again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get to basically relearn how to make
hash all over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That worked really well for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that's the best way to do
stuff is to cause a stir in this
[SPEAKER_06]: community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you find pentane to be dangerous
and how dangerous do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a heavy dabber and I hang out with a
lot of heavy dabbers and I'm a member of
[SPEAKER_06]: the community and we all appreciate what
Steep Hill is doing, keeping us safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys are revolutionizing medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are keeping us all safe and
healthy and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather some feelings get hurt than
some patience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of growth, what's in the
future for Steep Hill Halent?
[SPEAKER_06]: That lab is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that lab is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in that lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys gave me a quick tour and that
place was really neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe's an amazing guy also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steep Hill worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud of you guys and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's in the future for Addison
Demora?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to do for yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't you always on vacation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go spend some time with those beautiful
kids of yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's due.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is due.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what kind of mark do you want to
leave on our community, my friend?
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, when the world is coming to an end
and we're reading history books and they
[SPEAKER_06]: say that Addison Demora, what kind of mark
do you want to leave on this world?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want people to say about you
when you're gone?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very respectable answer,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, do you have any plugs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any plugs you want to give
shout outs or anything before we say
[SPEAKER_06]: goodbye to each other?
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, bro, I really appreciate you being my
first phone interview on my show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of awkward for me,
but I'm getting used to it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really good having a friend do it
for me, so I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, if you have anything you want to
add, you've got my phone number,
[SPEAKER_06]: feel free to call me anytime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in touch with me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give everybody out there a hug and a high
five for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, man, go spend some time with your
kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: You deserve it.
Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys, too, check us
out for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm slow running, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate you and I hope we talk
again soon.
Earl Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Earl Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also check out at Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of yourself, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace and love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: ladies and gentlemen, that was my first
phone interview ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was with Mr. Addison DeMora from Steep
Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a lot of education to give us
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I just got a hash education
for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was neat to hear some of the
things he said, especially towards the end
[SPEAKER_01]: about a lot of the specifics on the
testing that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't really know much about
that end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the beginning stuff I was I was
pretty much privy to, I guess you could
[SPEAKER_01]: say, and just kind of holding it in
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's neat to kind of have some of the
things I've been thinking about and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of my concerns also validated through
somebody who's so respected in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me being, you know, a beginner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't that always feel good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's it's just different.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're accidentally doing shit right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again, a big huge thank you to
Addison DeMora.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Addy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love you for that, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out at Earl Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how he spells it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll find out before the end of the show
that he's got some cool pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your stuff tested by Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always trust everything that they tell
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a good clean lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't they don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only reason I talk about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also to the secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did I come from of that southern
thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great cup, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, all those dabs got me, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking dabs while you guys were
listening to all the secret cup
[SPEAKER_06]: competitors whose concentrates were
tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not we're not calling you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not trying to diss you or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just this was the example that we had.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the results came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you guys will get together and
fix your tech and you guys will figure out
[SPEAKER_06]: how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see where everyone else is at,
too, because like like Addison said,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that's the first time they've done
that test for the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll kind of we'll see when we go to
the other regions what what the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: our hash test that and if it's similar or
if it's, you know, somewhere way different
[SPEAKER_01]: or who does what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did also mention that even though
butane is the highest concentrate
[SPEAKER_06]: concentration, most highly concentrated
them, that was hard to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: Butane is the most highly concentrated
residual solvent left in dabs that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: finding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said that that is not even at a
dangerous level.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you consider other applications that
we're using butane for.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't need to quit dabbing just
because of a little pentane scare.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just the new thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured out mystery oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've learned how to get rid of mystery
oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're we're a smart bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more we work with it and the more we
develop and the more we learn about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better we can make everything and we
can make things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like we've already keeps we already
keep stepping it up as a community,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep making things better and better and
easier and more safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's that's what it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Takes a community and we all pitch in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time you bring me back a batch of
hash, it's a little bit better every
[SPEAKER_06]: single time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single time I learn from every batch
of hash, I learn something from every
[SPEAKER_01]: single batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay attention to it, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just natural.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll share a website with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to scroll down to find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once I get to this website,
it's where a few of our highly respected
[SPEAKER_06]: hash community members it's where they
find and share their information.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be useful to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a pen to write that down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to also remember to give you the
correct at Earl Ripper Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just scroll through Instagram and look for
at E R R L Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's close to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find him.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's pictures of this dude named
Madison.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like that that Mexican drug
cartel that just got busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was really funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he kind of does kind of does look
like that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one cool thing that I heard in there
that caught my attention, they don't
[SPEAKER_06]: reveal the solvents they're testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For which is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of liked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's I think it's much less biased
and I think it just makes it really fair
[SPEAKER_01]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just try to make the best hash
you can make and we'll test it and find
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then we'll share information
to let you know what's going on after
[SPEAKER_01]: we're done testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, that's and now we know
to get rid of that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we learned the one I give you a big
thumbs down in the middle of that while he
[SPEAKER_06]: was talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps, terpenes, terpenoids, they're
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know the whole word,
you got to read the definition of
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoids and read what those are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you know what terpenoids are,
then you can say terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do that to trichomes also.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you say trichromes or trichomes,
it's T R I C H O M E S.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a trichome.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no chrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not polishing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to help you people be
educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to be an asshole,
even though I feel like one suddenly.
[SPEAKER_06]: These terpenoids, I'm speaking of boil at
the same temperatures as pentane.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're trying to purge off your
pentane, you're fucking destroying your
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the terps are the second one of my
favorite, second favorite part of the hash
[SPEAKER_06]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was an interesting part for me,
because when he started mentioning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, using the closed loop and the
cold trap and how it's getting us to
[SPEAKER_01]: these, you know, safe levels and things we
can do to further advance our
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, it's something I've been
talking about with a close group of
[SPEAKER_01]: friends of mine that we should have been
at this point when we first started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we should have been using
closed loop systems and cold traps and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that when concentrates first, when I first
learned how to make decent concentrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, we should have been
doing this way differently for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The money that, the money that you
invested in the material that I invested
[SPEAKER_06]: could have been better used towards,
but we didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for a fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing's always evolving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And man, I can't complain about any of the
hash you've made in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really like it, but there's two
years or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, how long have you been,
how long have you been killing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the time we went to Springs and
hung out in our friend's place?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since then you've been crushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You learned things from Denver and
Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That impressed me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know how to compensate and are you
going to, do you know, do you have an idea
[SPEAKER_06]: how to figure out how to remove the
pentane?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you got to go to, I took a couple of
notes from another spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's 106 degrees is where a
pentane starts to boil off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's also where the turpinoids burn
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are you going to, do you have an
idea of how to compensate for all that
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he was talking about with that
cold trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you're going to be able to suck those
gases out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cold traps, there's like three
chambers and they have different filters
[SPEAKER_01]: in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all trap different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and one of them traps turpinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you, you just reintroduce that back
into the hash afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, you trap your terpenes that
you lose and you reintroduce it back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the pentane is not the same
molecule structure or the same size as the
[SPEAKER_01]: turpinoids, uh, but it does boil off at a
similar, uh, temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I catch you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a filtration system and a
cold trap system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between the, you put the cold trap
between the vacuum pump and your vacuum
[SPEAKER_01]: oven or chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you're, you're vacuuming that,
that gas through, it traps stuff and it
[SPEAKER_01]: lets stuff through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds fucking brilliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I'm the, I'm glad I'm the breeder
and the grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have to do the, that sounds
too sciency for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would ruin that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel I'm, I feel so comfortable with the
plants and breeding and growing and I hear
[SPEAKER_01]: it and see, I don't, I feel very
comfortable with all of this sciency
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tima.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good team there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so find us at the secret cup this year
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we'll be roaming around together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I'm a white guy without
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes us easy to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're wearing hoodies and grassroots hats,
you know, we don't, we don't blend in at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have irie genetic shirts or elevated
concentration shirts or a mixture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have red eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cannabis cup is coming up,
but, uh, I'm, I'm just going, I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: promoting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a booth or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a bunch of friends with booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a great time at the cannabis cup
every year, so I'm just fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I read a post from a well-respected
member of the hash community on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, let me, I, on Facebook, I read a post.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's well respected everywhere,
not just on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be clear about that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy throws this secret cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he throws the dabs of Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: He, uh, he did the dabs of Denver event
and gave all of the proceeds to a care
[SPEAKER_06]: center.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the official word,
a care center so that they could buy
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves a van to get their residents to
and from their doctor's appointments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this dude puts his heart and soul into
what he does.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bro, you got my mad love.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy I'm talking about is big D.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he posted on Facebook, and I'm kind of
paraphrasing and chopping into pieces here
[SPEAKER_06]: so that it makes a good show, but it says
a rat in a lab can handle 6,800 PPMs of
[SPEAKER_06]: pentane with every single breath it takes
for 120 hours straight and have no
[SPEAKER_06]: discernible effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he also advised to make sure that
before you eat BHOU diet, you
[SPEAKER_06]: decarboxylize it and that'll make sure you
get rid of most residual carbons,
[SPEAKER_06]: gases, uh, things you don't want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he also says, excuse me, dabs are
clogging me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, if you choose to inhale BHO,
please make sure that you heat your dab up
[SPEAKER_06]: to 600 degrees at least until it vaporizes
and then filter it through water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by through water, he doesn't mean
filter it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He means use a bong, a water pipe,
a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do the dry hit dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we're at it, don't use shitty
Chinese import glass made by some fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: little kid without protective gear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, by American made.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know a glassblower, try to support
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if they're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they'll get better.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you give them work, they will get
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'll have something from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when they're fucking killing it,
when they're in the glass galleries next
[SPEAKER_06]: to our heroes, I bet the people that have
a coil piece from back in the day are
[SPEAKER_06]: ultra proud.
[SPEAKER_06]: What if your next glassblower friend
becomes coil condenser?
[SPEAKER_06]: Man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're all using the email and I,
I don't think a lot of us are heating it
[SPEAKER_06]: to 600 degrees because there's that low,
low temp dab sensation that's been going
[SPEAKER_06]: on the craze with the emails and carb
caps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, is that going to be a thing of the
past or are, are we too stubborn to even
[SPEAKER_06]: adjust?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, I, that's going to go,
that's going to change with technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as people develop their technique to
get rid of this pentane thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just like they said,
it evaporates the same at a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature as the terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing a low temp dab,
well, it tastes better because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: conserving more of the, the terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do a higher temp dab,
you're getting rid of more of the gas,
[SPEAKER_01]: like he's saying, but it doesn't taste as
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would only, you know, that's to
make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the people that dab with me know
that I kind of knocked the low temp dab
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not my style.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like those big, uh, kick you in the dick
kind of dabs, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're not sure if you're going to
have a stroke or if you're coming or if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're in the middle, it kind of feels
like you're drowning and disco dancing at
[SPEAKER_06]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love those dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once we start getting rid of a lot
of these gases again, and developing our
[SPEAKER_01]: technique to be even better, uh,
we're going to be able to do those low
[SPEAKER_01]: temp dabs and not inhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, thousands of PPM of pentane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big up to Steve Hill for helping me not
further harm my lungs with useless
[SPEAKER_06]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, a couple of the, a couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is number two.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had to be the last episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet in episode one, I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bet that in episode number one,
you said something about de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you are going to become my hash expert
on my, on my little podcast here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I, uh, can, can you, uh, define and
then, uh, describe the methods?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my disclaimer for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kev's not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did not go to science school.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't try this shit at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not responsible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be a fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_06]: Read a book, go to school, read a book,
read a book, read a motherfucking book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did read some books, but so it don't sue
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kev's a hash maker, not a scientist or
a professor or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, de-waxing from my knowledge is
when, as you're making the concentrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in the process, you, you use cold
temperatures to separate plant fats and
[SPEAKER_01]: lipids and waxes, uh, from the,
the oils because your, uh, your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and your terpenoids are
pretty much all oil form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So slightly different polarities with each
of the molecules, what have you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the, you, uh, the cold actually
separates the wax to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: allows you to, uh, after time,
you know, you let it sit for a little
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The layers separate and then you can pour
the oil through a filter just in case any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the wax is loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can filter it out with lab filter
paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at one point you're basically,
you've got your dabs where they're liquid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen at that point, it's sloshy and
now you're pouring it into something and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's settling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, essentially you have, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the chunky part is what we don't want
to, that's plant paraffins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, lipids, waxes, waxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are like the cellular structure
of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very carcinogenic, very harmful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do an experiment with you and
this is off topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see if we run silicates,
potassium silicates in a plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it makes a difference on the amount of
wax you take out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody has a grow room and you can do
that, if you have a hash guy that is doing
[SPEAKER_06]: this, I'd like to see, uh, our potassium
silicates affecting our, uh, wax and
[SPEAKER_06]: de-waxing processes and fucking up our
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep going, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make the picture clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got like this big, in my mind,
you've got a big container of goopy butane
[SPEAKER_06]: hash mixture and the chunky parts sink
into the bottom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks, it's the opposite of beer,
the heads on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like beer up top.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, essentially that goes
through a filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this, they, they make,
uh, essentially closed sealed,
[SPEAKER_01]: de-waxing chambers with regulators and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's essentially the same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still needs to be in a cold bath to get
the separation, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you transfer that oil into,
uh, the hot water bath or hot water
[SPEAKER_01]: container chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's gone into closed loop now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's all technically the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still do it the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all in a closed system now,
which makes it much easier, safer,
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher quality definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and that just removes all that
harmful plant matter, uh, from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the concentrates because a lot of
what, what causes the congestion and the
[SPEAKER_01]: harshness when, when you smoke flour is a
lot of that is, is a carcinogenic plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've also read that it makes people
puke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it makes you nauseous if you,
if you inhale too much, if you consume too
much.
It definitely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can give you headaches, make you really
lightheaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That in our medicine, kind of productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you've taken, you run it through a
filtration, you pour that shit through
[SPEAKER_06]: like a funnel and it filters out and then,
then it goes to the back purge
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think most of the hash makers
understand that, uh, and if you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that school because it's not,
you're going to have to do research.
[SPEAKER_06]: We may leave shit out so that you have to,
we don't want to guide you into fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself or any of my friends or any of
your patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use, you know, uh, screen mesh,
things like that to filter whatever size
[SPEAKER_06]: of whenever you're trying to get out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do different, uh, do different strains
require different size screen meshes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're making bubble from what
I've noticed, yes, different, different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains have different, uh, trichome
sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will affect your yield in
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use different filter sizes
makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will affect your purity levels too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you, if you have smaller
trichomes, and you're using a bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: filter, uh, you're going to get a lot more
of that nasty whack stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that waste solvent, wet shit
through the mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good, good description, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one more question I have about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that, uh, how does that affect your
yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth, you know, I haven't seen it
affect my yield in enough of a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: way to change what I'm doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you started doing it for me,
the hash hasn't come back like lighter or
[SPEAKER_06]: anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been acceptable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you don't take out the waxes,
I've noticed you get the heavy lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I dab with other people and I know who is
de-waxing and who's not usually after a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've started to notice that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you can also tell
because if you don't do wax, it'll leave,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, residual particles on your nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why I got to replace and or scrape
my nail every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I shouldn't scrape it,
but I can't fucking replace it every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you dab like we do over here,
you go through nails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey task, it's time for some new nails,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need the, uh, the duality 14,
18, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a couple of fluxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you can tell me to go flux myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to task rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: With plenty of good titanium keeps me,
uh, keeps me dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get one of those Trinity nails
soon for my new rig that's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give that guy a shout out that glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, uh, I don't know his freaking last
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know his company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find out, find out what he wants to be
called and we'll all have you back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin will be back.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll give this class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll figure out all the information cause
he's a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a pretty cool new rig going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you're ready to go to the closed
loop and cold packs, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, I really am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon as soon as I can grab one up,
I'm, I'm getting it soon as I can grab
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pricey and yeah, they don't grow
on trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just recently became employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a second unless my job
wants to start hooking it up on
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get something going there,
but that's up to them on the air begging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I like to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the more I can step up my
game and the more I can, uh, advance my
[SPEAKER_01]: process, technique, equipment,
the more I want to do so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I kind of hinted that I was going to
share a website.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to look up real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to scroll through this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've saved a couple of, yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to lie to our friends
cause we've got loyal listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two episodes and they've paid
attention this far.
[SPEAKER_06]: skunkfarmresearch.com, skunkfarmresearch
.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the one that told me that posted on
Facebook that that was a good site to look
[SPEAKER_06]: for hash information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I need to correct myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, lower temps.
[SPEAKER_06]: The boiling point of pentane is 97
degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said 96.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to correct myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: See I'm fucking lying twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 97.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so yeah, I just wanted to correct some
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to introduce a new part of
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to create a segment here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called give thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's a segment where I want to give
thanks to somebody who has contributed
[SPEAKER_06]: heavily, uh, to the cannabis world and
deserves some thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this, uh, this episode we're going to
give thanks to Mr. Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if you don't know who Mark Emory is,
uh, he's in a bunch of movies.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in, uh, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Jaime with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the guy that talks for forever,
forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug looks like he took a nap while he was
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He smokes like a six foot bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably five feet, four or five
feet, maybe six and just talks his ass
[SPEAKER_06]: off.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got, uh, those droopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like, uh, was it droopy?
[SPEAKER_06]: The dog that remembered dopey droopy,
the dog going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the droopy eyes because all the
fucking Wheaties smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a Canadian guy, but we won't hold
that against him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mark Emory, I'm going to read a little
bit about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Emory is a Canadian, cannabis reform
policy advocate who is currently serving
[SPEAKER_06]: five years in American federal prison for
selling cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, I said American federal
prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to come into play later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark shipped seeds from Canada to the
United States and he was charged with
[SPEAKER_06]: conspiracy to manufacture marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark was the publisher of culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stuttering here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mark was a publisher of cannabis
culture magazine and once ran for the
[SPEAKER_06]: mayor of the city of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this dude's not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call Mark a soldier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's cheesy as shit, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mark started, um, Mark started Mark
Emory direct marijuana seeds in 1995,
[SPEAKER_06]: which he ran until it was raided by
Vancouver police acting on a request of
[SPEAKER_06]: the United States drug enforcement
administration.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say that again, more clearly
without stuttering.
[SPEAKER_06]: This dude was raided by the Vancouver
police acting on the request of the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States drug enforcement administration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So America called Canada and was like,
this guy is pissing us off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You fuck with him and they did it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't even there.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you, he's in another country and
America is just overstepping their
[SPEAKER_06]: boundaries in my opinion and going and
pulling this dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you went to, if you went to James high
elementary school and a Kevin elementary
[SPEAKER_06]: school, some shit went down.
[SPEAKER_06]: James high school isn't going to come get
you that the schools aren't going to trade
[SPEAKER_06]: your ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking where you do your,
where you do your crimes, where you do
[SPEAKER_06]: your crime, where you did your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was no crime in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on a fucking right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read keeps me focused.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mark Emory was taken into custody on
September 28th of 2009 and held at the
[SPEAKER_06]: North Frazier pretrial center in BC to
await.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I cut and pasted this and I missed
something, but I'll keep going to wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he was held there to wait extradition
to the USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on May the 10th of 2010, justice
minister Rob Nicholson signed the order
[SPEAKER_06]: and ordered Emory to surrender to
authorities, which he did the same day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bullshit on May 10th, 2010, justice
minister, justice minister Nicholson ruled
[SPEAKER_06]: Emory be extradited to the United States
where Mark faced five years in the U S
[SPEAKER_06]: penal system.
[SPEAKER_06]: The possibility existed that Emory may be
allowed to serve all or part of his
[SPEAKER_06]: sentence in Canada, but us authorities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rejected this option rejected.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to come to America.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Emory was extradited to the United
States on May 24th.
[SPEAKER_06]: He appeared in a Seattle courtroom and
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy
[SPEAKER_06]: to manufacture marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had to plead guilty because I mean,
imagine the fucking court pressure,
[SPEAKER_06]: all the lawyers, all the bullshit up
against him, take all your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and that's part of what this,
they think this was about, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark was heavily involved in politics and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and they think Mark's people think
that they were trying to take,
[SPEAKER_06]: take all of his money because he made a
lot of money selling seeds and they were
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to take his money and get him out
of politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on September 10th, 2010, in a Seattle
courtroom, Mark Emory was sentenced to
[SPEAKER_06]: five years in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: U S district court judge Ricardo Martinez
since Emory stating there was no question
[SPEAKER_06]: his actions were criminal and that Emory
insured others broke the law by selling
[SPEAKER_06]: them seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many things that go through my
head right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis seeds, their little bits to
preserve their souvenirs, their
[SPEAKER_06]: preservation, their gifts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, probably 30% of those were ever
actually grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure he made people promise they
wouldn't germinate them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you do on a, what's what they
do on a seed site, apparently,
[SPEAKER_06]: allegedly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the court noted that Emory claimed on
his website to have made some $3 million a
[SPEAKER_06]: year from selling seeds from his Vancouver
headquarters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to call you out, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a fucking mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever say you made $3 million selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever fucking talk about how much
money you made.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my personal advice in the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so Emory donated almost all of the
money generated from his seed sales to
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana policy reform efforts.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just redeemed your fuck ups for
bragging about your money in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Emory's claims at all that his Emory
claims that his arrest was political.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this was, these claims were disputed
by the prosecution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm dabbed out and trying to read.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so on November 19th, 2010,
Mark Emory was transferred to the D Ray
[SPEAKER_06]: James Correctional Facility in Folkston,
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's since then been transferred to a
federal correctional institution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's called Yazoo City Low to serve
the rest of his sentence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mark Emory is a victim of the drug war
and we owe him a cannabis medal of honor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we salute you and we give you thanks
Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, from the bottom of our hearts,
from the whole cannabis world,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Emory, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're sorry you're in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we wish we could all split that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amongst us and serve an hour or a day or
whatever we had to do just to take a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: She needs him at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs to be at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in federal prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen some of the shit they make him
do there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, uh, so dude, seriously, much love
and respect from Mark Emory and the prison
[SPEAKER_06]: that he's in, they make him tuck the beds
down like military style and they give you
[SPEAKER_06]: a checklist of what you're allowed and you
get so many, like one toothbrush,
[SPEAKER_06]: three ounces of toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_06]: This shit's ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody should have to live like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel sorry for the poor dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel sorry for everybody in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe now that we've, uh, changed some
marijuana laws here, we'll start releasing
[SPEAKER_06]: all the people that are locked up for
cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was a case that,
uh, and it was kind of a ridiculous try,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they got one lady's cannabis case
overthrown, but there was also,
[SPEAKER_06]: there were also other ridiculous charges
in that case.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's still incarcerated on those
charges, but the cannabis is erased from
[SPEAKER_06]: the chart.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no, but I mean, it's still kind
of, so that in court that shit counts that
[SPEAKER_06]: since precedent stands for forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had a good podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like it's a good time to stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you got any plugs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody you want to say what's up to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, uh, just thanks for having me on
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, thanks for coming to be in my
hash guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irie genetics is always killing it on the
seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are many of the other guys here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some good breeders coming out of
the woodworks here and, uh, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start setting some, some new standards
on some new, new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting to see, especially coming from
the end process, the concentrate end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see some new tastiness coming
out and some very oily stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited for all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I look forward to competing with
all the, the extract artists in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the secret cup coming up in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'll see everybody at the,
at the cannabis cup and, uh, let's do some
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be surprised if you see some
collaborations in breeding companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cannabis cup, there are talks of
trades and some meetings and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: exciting stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, thanks again to add us into more
for all the, all the good knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: always, always making this community step
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, really awesome to steep
Hill and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole crew, big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quoted a lot of your Facebook posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you posting as always the
whole community, just, just for killing it
[SPEAKER_01]: and moving up and coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving up and coming together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what it's all about guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit being, uh, well, I'm not accusing
anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be selfish and stingy with your
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to, uh, try to share and help each
other to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you see somebody doing something
wrong, don't try to call them out on their
[SPEAKER_06]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gently correct them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's help each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some people don't want to fucking
learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to help people sometimes and they just
don't want to hear your shit, but the
[SPEAKER_06]: people that want to learn, help them
learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't try to shoot them down because it's
the only way we're going to get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was episode number two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Promise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got more great episodes coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, check out nature's green.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remedies.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out Irene genetics, Colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check me out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at Rasta Jeff four 20 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we are, uh, at I grow culture on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just made a Twitter and, uh,
look at, uh, at Irene genetics on
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram for some ridiculous cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saving a whole bunch of, I had a photo
shoot the other day that was very well
[SPEAKER_06]: done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to take photo credits.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants are all mine, but the,
uh, the photos were from another friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll bring them on the show and let them
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you guys are going to see some great
new photography coming up for me pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I'm going to select an outro song
here and, uh, we'll catch you guys next
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace and love.

[SPEAKER_06]: I respect you so much, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for all the stuff you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, the song was D day.

[SPEAKER_06]: Friends of mine, great music.
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number two, I opened with Marlon
Asher ganja farmer because they call me

[SPEAKER_06]: Got to stay proper and give credit to the
people that help us out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I got to give a big shout out to my
buddy, Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_06]: He made me a really stylish logo for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, uh, microphone with the bud growing
out of it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that stuff's looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Wade Ridley's designs.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting good at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well done, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, another big, big ridiculous shout out
to my buddy Tony without Tony.
[SPEAKER_06]: This wouldn't even happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Tony does my web stuff and you're a
boss at that ship, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: He really helped me got a feed going,
got me up on iTunes really quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a pro bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes my website look good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read genetics, Colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a look there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then most importantly, thanks to the

[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a huge thanks again to
Addison Demora, uh, for his in depth
[SPEAKER_06]: description of the test.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still talking about that, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still learning from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been played it multiple times just
to, what the fuck did he say in that part?
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to take a note in my head to try to
remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big shout out Addison.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did, uh, gave us check out episode two.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you missed it gave us a nice long,
uh, description and education on,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, testing of cannabis and edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to everyone that's gotten this
far with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, uh, we're hanging out again.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Kevin from elevated concentrations
to my front.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Over to my left.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got milky trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's white Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I just learned that Colorado Springs
has a, uh, an MED facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're trying to get badging in
Colorado, definitely it'll slow down the,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, the overflow cause Denver was getting
crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, somebody at work was talking
about that a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is really cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you try to open a, uh, sweet stone
candy, the package with your teeth,
[SPEAKER_06]: get scissors, get some scissors on open up
your teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I screwed up my jaw the other day with
that one in your freaking car,
[SPEAKER_01]: my car after the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get it open the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My jaw was so sore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are super childproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your child can get scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get into that, but you shouldn't
have your child get into the scissors
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just tried to jack up my teeth trying to
open it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to eat this, uh, while we're
live eating or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not live.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're live here, but the show's not live.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we are on the show, I'm going to
eat a, uh, we're alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're mostly live.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk about that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to do it, do it closer to
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say for fool's day, we did not kill
anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm eating that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm eating a sweet stone candy,
cotton candy, gemstone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to throw up my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like I'm opening a condom to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened one of these at a comedy show and
I'm pretty sure that at least one or two
[SPEAKER_06]: people had to think for until I reached in
and pulled out a candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to think I was busting open a
condom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the exact same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've done nothing but talk shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said the rapper fucked up my teeth and
looks like a condom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just put this candy in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the shit talking is done.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had the cotton candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the cotton candy good?
[SPEAKER_01]: That Dr. P was freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I could smell that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in the car and he busted open Dr.
P and I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was eating some chips and I was like,
these chips have some weird chemical that
[SPEAKER_06]: are making me crave Dr. Pepper like so
badly right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he started giggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be by Dr. P sweet stone.
Possibly.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing's tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Claude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys don't pay me to say shout out to
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just make great edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that gets me to say good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're super nice people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're so lucky here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope to see you guys at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's get down to business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, somebody was responsible for keeping
a pipe loader.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know it was not loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in front of the weed is in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will take that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I forget you like empty halfway
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're connoisseurs at this table,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still connoisseur level if there's
still green weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're we're smoking on some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't quite as empty as Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dad's dad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin made some wax for me this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually I get shattered, but he wanted to
experiment, make some wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure that the it was
like riding a bike and I could still
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish said task to task accomplished
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a well done job.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it because I could pick it up and
just drop a big fat glob on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, that was my my sweet stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not good us who are less versed in
wax, dabs, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: The differences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the shatter you you can drop it,
but it's harder to handle.
[SPEAKER_06]: The shatter is a little stickier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's if your fingers are warm,
it'll melt and get sticky and stick to
[SPEAKER_06]: your fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wax is it doesn't stick as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, since this is a topic to just a
little bit about the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter and wax, they're essentially the
same product or or they're essentially the
[SPEAKER_01]: same product, just different
consistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And towards the end of the process,
you do a slightly different technique with
[SPEAKER_01]: each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involves timing temperatures,
agitation, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can you can achieve the different
consistencies, which is essentially all
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter and wax are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just different consistencies of
the same same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people hate on wax.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm I tell everybody to stay on the mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over here bobbing back and forth on
Stevie Wonder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm high, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eating a sweet stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a wonderful night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanging out to my favorite bros even the
highest guy in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hate on chatter, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people that are just really
into the wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like a lot of the
conversations that go on with us in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 710 community with the extract artists,
especially as we're not sharing so much
[SPEAKER_01]: information with the public anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sharing it a lot with ourselves and
we're learning a lot more about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what what's better and what is
actually going on with the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really nice to see how it
continues to evolve and the knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of personal opinion on
indeed whether wax or chatter is
[SPEAKER_01]: preferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of opinion and some some
verification of of one being cleaner than
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave that up to everybody to go
and do some research and read it because
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to kind of spill your beans from
what I have read from trusted sources.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have and I have not studied this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read this on Facebook from people
that I respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: The the wax is usually cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes back with less residual solvents
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's what I agree with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I have read as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the people that are hating the butters
or the wax is the butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would can I would consider butter
goopier and stuff that we wouldn't dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't dab butter if it's runny and
dripping off your shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably won't dab that exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shattery, sap, snap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll hit that all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some good crumble if I want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to put a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to heat the nails.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give it a little sizzle test
before I inhale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a hippie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to blow a didgeridoo so I know
how to make it look like I'm inhaling and
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get rid of that smoke if it sizzles
or tastes like doo-doo and I won't take
[SPEAKER_06]: your dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it looks good, I'll hit some wax.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason I like the difference is the
shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to use the dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a little dab tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a little more work, a little more
effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock says the tip of the dabber tends
to chip the shatter in my eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time you buy shatter from a
dispensary, you're going to take it home
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're going to get your little dab
tool and you're going to stick it in that
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking shatter and you're going to break
off a piece and it's going to fly across
[SPEAKER_06]: the room and you're never going to find
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be pissed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one dab for your dead home.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to get used to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the way it goes for the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't experienced that yet,
use your thumb and just rub your thumb on
[SPEAKER_06]: there and heat that shit up a little bit
until it comes pliable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have a big thumb print,
poly deal talk shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit putting your fingerprints all over my
damn shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get it and heat it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the wax because I can grab however
big of a piece I want and squish it
[SPEAKER_06]: together and make a nice little ball and
then heat up my nail and just slam dunk it
[SPEAKER_06]: like I'm Michael Jordan on that
motherfucker and get it nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: The consistency makes it punch me harder
on the hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll admit it, shatter is slightly
smoother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sap is really smooth, but the fuck,
I like that heavy and it's not heavy like
[SPEAKER_06]: when you're smoking CO2 oil, I do not
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always makes me feel like it's bubbly
in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm drowning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting a weird flavor, but the wax
gives me a pleasant punch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when you're in high school and
you take a big fucking bong hit and you'd
[SPEAKER_06]: be like, oh, I'm really ... It gives me
that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I need to reduce my dabbing since
it's taking me a quarter gram dab of some
[SPEAKER_06]: good wax to get that punch to the face
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weed breaks to great things for the
body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I need to take a nice bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want to talk about this until I
had it more planned out, but a friend of
[SPEAKER_06]: ours, a collective friend, I think we all
three know him, he's a doctor and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: going to have him send me to a local drug
testing facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to wake up in the morning,
I'm going to go to the doctor and he's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to write me the recommendation to go
and somebody else is going to drive me.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the way there, I'm going to take dabs
and I'm going to drive to a drug testing
[SPEAKER_06]: facility and dab the fuck out like I
normally would.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to a dab session,
six or seven fat dabs and walk in there
[SPEAKER_06]: and let them take my blood and then
measure my THC content.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'm going to go the whole day and not
dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: After that session, I'll live the rest of
the day without any dabs and then I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: going to go in in the morning and go in
and have them take my THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'm going to go another day and then
try to ... Or maybe a couple of days later
[SPEAKER_06]: or something, I'm going to have to
challenge myself and not take dabs,
[SPEAKER_06]: which would be fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to measure myself at two or three
different points, urine and blood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find out where I am right after I dab,
where I am when I wake up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should include one more,
but there's so many that I'd like to do,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I have to pay for each test out of my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to get a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to try to help me out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to try to make it not as
expensive as it should be because he knows
[SPEAKER_06]: the people in the lab and such.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got to be a fun conversation at the
drug testing lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell them what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see ... My goal is to find out
where we wake up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't dab as much as I do,
but for your body weight, dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: you keep up closely, little Kev.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went home from work and did 15 straight
and went to bed the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have shit that hurts and you've got a
good valid reason and you like to take
[SPEAKER_06]: some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to find out where our nanograms or
THC is in our blood to find out if we're
[SPEAKER_06]: legal to drive because when we're going to
do an episode about DUIs and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado, did you just cut out the
headphones, Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's doing something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think your channel has issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: We apologize for the tech difficulties.
[SPEAKER_04]: That requires- Whatever you did,
just fixed it.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sweet stone's dissolving and it's
giving me a little ... My throat was all
[SPEAKER_06]: clogged up, so excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some wonderful sweet stone flavor in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first piece of the cotton candy is
dissolved to where I need another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit is delish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're different colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every flavor I've had are amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to wait until this piece
is completely gone and try the blue and
[SPEAKER_06]: see if it varies in flavor or if they just
did them different colors to be cute.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk to people in other states and
they're like, I heard you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: brownies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, yeah, you can get brownies
in 95.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had store shelf brownies since what,
2004?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike and I worked at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's insanely huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when we worked at Medamar and our
friend the baker would come in and we were
[SPEAKER_06]: budtenders.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the manager and Mike was my backup
budtender.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a head budtender, I guess you'd call
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: The boss would come in and this was before
all the weird regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would just make edibles at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call this the Wild West days out
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd make these edibles at home and they
would bring them in by the tray and they
[SPEAKER_06]: would have one set aside for Mike and I of
everything that they made that they
[SPEAKER_06]: brought in for inventory that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes there'd be a good six or seven
pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had fudge, that white fudge,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will fight you for the last piece of
that fudge every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit is so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got me high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss the banana bread.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still drink the banana bread,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only was it delicious, it was like a
kick to the face from the mule.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of the day was just a beautiful
bliss.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a 200 pound man roll down two
flights of stairs, not like a straight
[SPEAKER_06]: line.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had to turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: These stairs went straight down and turned
to 180 and came back at you as they went
[SPEAKER_06]: down the second flight.
[SPEAKER_06]: He rolled down two flights of those stairs
and giggled like a fucking cartoon
[SPEAKER_06]: character because of too much of that
banana bread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too many pieces of banana bread when he
was upstairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be times when I'd look at one
of the bosses and be like, can somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: just do this for a minute?
[SPEAKER_06]: They would laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't care that I was too high to
function.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd walk in and set the tray down and
traffic would stop for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd go, eat one of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me if it's any good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go, all right, it's like 1105.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just opened, but yes, boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifteen minutes later, she'd walk by and
go, how'd it taste?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd say it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'd say, cool, try the fudge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, oh, what a dream job,
people.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a lot better than that anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: The banana bread, the fudge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: They made some sugar cookies that were
shaped like weed leaves that I could eat
[SPEAKER_06]: like a million of those in a shift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't like caramel, but I heard the
caramels that were amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mic just got ridiculously freaking
loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a really good chef back in the
middle of our days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Random question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Kevin, if you could hear any song
right now, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any song right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked you a on the spot question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just fuck shit up.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that song.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not Jesus, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a Ween song.
Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: You failed at my test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like five songs in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your one of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: The mollusk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a Ween song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're head a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Work hard, play hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Wiz Khalifa right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's completely different into the
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to the Wiz Khalifa Snoop
Show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't end up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how I feel about paying $130
for a concert ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Partially, I love Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, but it's April 20th.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went last year on 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: You went with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read that it's going to snow by the
weather reports, but that's too far away
[SPEAKER_06]: to judge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Morrison.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't know it was going to be
cold, you're not from here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen widespread panic that are nine
or 12 times, and it's never been as
[SPEAKER_06]: freaking cold as it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen either of those artists,
and those are two of my favorite artists
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd probably pay $60 or $70 to go
see either one on a headline tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why pay extra just because it's on 420?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of shit going on that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really paying extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying for each artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they both do a good hour,
I'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to go see Snoop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see him on a more indoor venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I finished the pink piece of the Sweet
Stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm letting that flavor get out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm about to throw in the blue piece and
see if it tastes any differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the fucking rudest thing I could
have ever done.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fucking disgusting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes the same as far as my taste buds
can tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may have a thicker, more flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my tongue is going numb from all the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sucking on them real slowly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed last time I ate these,
I ate the whole pack as slowly as I could,
[SPEAKER_06]: sucking on them in a comedy show to not
have cotton mouth and not have to piss
[SPEAKER_06]: every 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they work greatly for that,
by the way, if you need to go somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: and just suck on some candy, these are the
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My tongue went numb, though, and my lips
went all numb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to talk to people,
and I was like, hey, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get that figured out real
quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: This little girl was tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: She got up on a bar stool and measured my
dreadlocks to her body height.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was like, I bet your dreadlocks are as
tall as me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she got up on a bar stool and
measured.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to have a topic for the show,
not just a bunch of dudes sitting here
[SPEAKER_06]: getting stoned, although it's been fucking
good at that today.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was ordered to do this before we even
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leader of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I ordered you, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to order.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, keep that bowl filled and threw
the bag of weed at me throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody looks at you and throws a bag
of weed in a pipe at you and is like,
[SPEAKER_06]: keep this full, you got to kind of just
man up and keep that shit full.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not complaining at all, but I'm just
saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just had a conversation about
Shatter and Wax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shatter or Wax, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go with Wax.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got one of each here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a Shatter dab for Kev, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: The coughing you hear from me is no
comment on the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike is, I'm surprised he's not coughing
from looking at the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel the cough building now,
just thinking about the dab to come,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is entirely tobacco use related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say a lot of cigarette
smokers have issues with dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people I see having the most
issues with coughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really curious if our listeners enjoy
us just chilling out, smoking some dabs
[SPEAKER_06]: and bullshitting, or if they like it
better when I'm reading and getting the
[SPEAKER_06]: news.
[SPEAKER_06]: Comment people, let us know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tweet it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'd like to do a show that is for
the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just for us to sit here and get
dabbed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to serve a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first two were very news related,
and this one so far has been very sit
[SPEAKER_01]: around dab related.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's been 20 minutes of us just
bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get to the point, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have points and things we are going
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a new friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is helping me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was the best transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just packed up dabs for both of these
guys on the two dabbers I've got available
[SPEAKER_06]: and did not save a dab for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want the beer rig, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Purple beer rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Purple drippy beer rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hand you the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy beer glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shatter dab on the highly educated carb
cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot what strain this was.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Jack the Ripper from my garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually bred by TJ Subcool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out TJ Subcool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this candy in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like a rude asshole.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not melt the dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do another podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a podcast called 719 the blocks with
my friend, Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shameless plug there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's much more.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as dabby as this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is entertaining.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wade, I handed him the dabber ready to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're live doing a show.
[SPEAKER_06]: He put his mic on the microphone or his
mouth on the microphone and dropped the
[SPEAKER_06]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: He held the rig in front of him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't burn anything, but he dropped
the dab on the nail and inhaled into the
[SPEAKER_06]: mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was priceless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I called him out on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you guys catch that episode,
it'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chugging that sucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I enjoy every episode of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts out with a fuck you,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because you said that the intro was
monotone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the intro is monotone, but I don't
mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I fire up a show, I start with
a good laugh because of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: 719 the blocks podcast is what we're
ranting about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tasty dab of Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last batch did not come out that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Jack the Ripper batch that we
did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's that batch, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the very end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know the batch we did before this
one of Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a phenotype that I was trying to get
something out of that phenotype,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it wasn't what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried to be stubborn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have gotten rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing against that phenotype,
that strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll grow Jack again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that phenotype wasn't a keeper for me,
so it's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a five pack of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll run that again and find that lemon
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this run tastes much better in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, you need the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike is going to cough like a champ
because it's not a little baby dab that I
[SPEAKER_06]: gave him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could just be the difference in technique
from a couple months ago to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're learning a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learn a lot from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This makes perfect, yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm often impressed by the knowledge that
I see you gain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're hanging out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the fuck did he learn that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did that idea just come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know when I'm sitting in my
corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the turbinoid question I texted
you about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to discuss that on the air?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something you'd rather keep on the
down low?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about cold traps and pulling
Mike just goes wandering off.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not going to cough into the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's too respectful for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't hear from him in 10 minutes,
we've got to go find him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Call Domino.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that'll do, but okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode will be train wreck number
three.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're using cold traps and we're pulling
out the gases and the leftover
[SPEAKER_06]: contaminants and we're also separating
turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you said something that caught my
attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reintroduce the turpenoids back into the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that it's tasty and contains
turpenoids, which also affect your high
[SPEAKER_06]: and your medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could I hypothetically save that cold
trap, set those turpenoids aside,
[SPEAKER_06]: run another batch, gather those
turpenoids, set them aside, run another
[SPEAKER_06]: batch and introduce all three batches of
turpenoids into one batch of smaller hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a point of overdoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes a little bit of a explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a point of overdoing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would take some experimentation
to figure out what would be overdoing and
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be where you wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also a better use would to not
necessarily get more flavor, but to save
[SPEAKER_01]: different terpenes that you trap from
different cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's different concentrations
of different terpene molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take those different terpene molecules,
combine those in a ratio for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments, because the turpenoids have been
known to help with certain conditions and
[SPEAKER_01]: help with how we receive the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a better and more
practical use for it, is the combination
[SPEAKER_01]: of certain terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the future bring us isolating the
cannabinoids specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to be able to,
in the future, definitely isolate several
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, if not all of them,
and several terpenoids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Readily identify them and separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would take a couple different
processes, almost like a condensation
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction, along with your normal solvent
reactions, to get specific molecules out
[SPEAKER_01]: of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have to purify it like they do gases
and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Addison mentioned, or I may have
mentioned on one of the past shows,
[SPEAKER_01]: the butane and pentane and stuff all comes
from petroleum that's refined into those
[SPEAKER_01]: gases based on their boiling points.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take several reactions like
that to be able to refine terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to start to discover
the differences in them and each molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: structures, specific melting points,
boiling points, and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be able to separate that and
reintroduce them with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could separate the whole pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heat the pieces we need to cook off the
... I don't know if it's cooking off,
[SPEAKER_06]: but boiling off, dissipate, maybe the word
I'm looking for, dissipate the gases and
[SPEAKER_06]: other products we don't want, filter out
contaminants and waxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will that bring us to ...
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a cylinder, a graduated cylinder,
I think that's the word, with different
[SPEAKER_06]: layers of sediments in it that'll show
waxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually what I'm headed for,
what I want to know in the end,
[SPEAKER_06]: are we going to be able to pull apart
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to say, here's all the
pesticide that was found in your plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to get to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: As the research continues, I bet we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why not.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guys at Steak Hill can identify a
pesticide in a plant that was treated
[SPEAKER_06]: while in early veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can identify it in a dried and
finished fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already at that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you've got to think about what some
of you were saying a second ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are already breeding plants to be 15
to 1 CBD THC ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already on that stage of
separating stuff in the plant stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dabbing and concentrates in relative
time aspect is much newer than growing
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very early in our research and our
study with what can be done and how it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already moved very, very,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as more people and with the
legalization, more people like PhDs in
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry and things like that,
that know a lot about the subjects,
[SPEAKER_01]: come into it, that'll start to teach the
whole community about all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steak Hill is a perfect example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I mentioned on Facebook
today on somebody's post, they were
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about CBD and how CBD helps them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to remind people, don't forget
about the other cannabinoids, the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to make people understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can identify 60 of them right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There have got to be a lot more because
we're discovering new shit every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was off coughing, I was thinking
that what you were talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sanjay Gupta was just talking about in his
last weed two specialty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me while I cough a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs are going to do that to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs just ruined me for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you two have been talking about is
the very forefront of something he
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned in his show called the entourage
effect, or at least that's what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: calling it now in medical circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: What that is is the different
cannabinoids, the 60 of them that you were
[SPEAKER_04]: just talking about working together to
produce amazing medical effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the hard sell in medical marijuana
is it's so useful treating so many
[SPEAKER_04]: different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: When someone doesn't believe you from the
get go and you tell them that it helps
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer, epilepsy, AIDS, the list goes on
and on, they think you're lying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that it's just different
combinations of these different
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids having amazing effects all
over the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: You two are on the forefront of that with
some of the work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy that it's happening in places
like it's happening instead of research
[SPEAKER_04]: labs and research laboratories across the
US because the law, it's just silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to point out that I'm really
thankful and grateful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to point out whatever I am
thankful to, but whatever you believe in,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fucking thankful to that because I've
got such a really cool position where I
[SPEAKER_06]: get to grow a medical cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of these guys sitting at my table,
I'm their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm their medical marijuana supplier and
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to talk with my bro Kev and see what
hurts, what doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, dude, I really like this strain
that you grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes my X not X and my smile go smile.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, and you just smile like a dipshit
when I said that, but that face when you
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke the weed that I grow to make you not
feel like shit, that's golden to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing for you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you love my grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hurting when I got here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a rough week at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been hauling a lot of heavy things up a
lot of stairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within half an hour of getting here,
I was paying free and that's all due to
[SPEAKER_04]: the medicine you produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just angers me when people say it's not
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read that a dozen times today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when I read about CBD only legislation,
finally somebody's listening, but they're
[SPEAKER_04]: clearly not paying enough attention to
what's being said.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're taking away, CBD only
legislation is actually going to help
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You respect the whole plant, not just one
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely need the full profile of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I try to explain to any
patients or customers I get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary I work at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I really try to push is
that this entire profile of this plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: very important and that's why concentrates
really help so much because it can
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate that profile of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the whole plant, not just teeny
pieces of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That brings me to another topic that I
want to discuss.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have something lined up for the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Colorado Department of Public Health
and Environment is actually attempting to
[SPEAKER_06]: pass a bill to limit caregivers to six
plants per patient and a limit of five
[SPEAKER_06]: patients per caregiver, which is going to
be a cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You gave me a funny face.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my Mountain Dew bottle sounds crazy
loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: My headphones, no matter where I move it,
it gets louder.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to make it to where a
caregiver with five patients and including
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself if you want to grow medicine for
yourself, but they don't even allow a
[SPEAKER_06]: number for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to make it to where a private
caregiver is capped out at 30 plants
[SPEAKER_06]: total.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to the medical marijuana doctor
and you pay your regular fee, the doctor
[SPEAKER_06]: should see you, examine you, and write you
your recommendation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That comes with a standardized count of
six plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have three of those plants in
flower and three of those plants in the
[SPEAKER_06]: veg stage, which means some are budding
and some are not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to read your own book to get that
far with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: To even get to what we're talking about
now, there's a whole lot of history.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to catch this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of people who made crazy
decisions to get us here, but this is what
[SPEAKER_04]: legislatures decided.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a nice little article written by a
friend of mine who's very well written.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read through it and try to do
the best I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give people an update on what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, they write your card.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use your old man as an
example.
[SPEAKER_06]: He requires a little more medicine than
some people because he's got a condition
[SPEAKER_06]: that we need to supply him with.
[SPEAKER_06]: The doctor knows that because he's met
with a doctor and the doctor said,
[SPEAKER_06]: holy shit, you've got a condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to get you treated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's your caregiver?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does he grow?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much medicine do you need?
[SPEAKER_06]: How is your grow going to make that much
medicine?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here's that many plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They send it into the registry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: His caregiver has set up a grow to supply
that much medicine for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: That caregiver also has more patients that
he's responsible for.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a certain amount of people he's
responsible for taking care of.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to grow this many plants,
produce this many ounces of weed for this
[SPEAKER_06]: many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a thought of people are taking
care of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they want to chop that down to only
30 plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, people are going to run out of
medicine early because if I'm not able ...
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I've got five patients that I'm
responsible for plus myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to pull weight off of a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys can smoke some weed between the
raw flowers that we smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flowers is the buds for the people that
aren't in the industry or aren't caught up
[SPEAKER_06]: on terms.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we say flower, we just mean buds,
dried and cured, manicured buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Concentrates, I'm usually talking about
some BHOs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Between the flowers and the dabs and the
edibles that these guys require,
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to grow more than what I'm actually
... I'm not doing it, but I could use more
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could definitely use an increase in your
guys' numbers because you guys like to
[SPEAKER_06]: medicate heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in this, you have to get into some
of the requirements for actually growing
[SPEAKER_04]: quality medical marijuana here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six marijuana plants sounds like a lot of
marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 marijuana plants sounds like a whole
lot of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier, you guys were talking about
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's talking about different
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're capped at 30 and you're trying
to supply five different people,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of a sudden, you're incredibly limited
into what you can do, what you can work
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't have CBD only strains or
Charlotte's Web or any of that without a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary system that was allowed to grow
thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In trying to care give, you almost have to
do hundreds of plants over a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: years to really get your patients figured
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something else I wanted to get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, trying to do that 30 at a time is
just crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to grow big plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like a seven gallon pot full with the
soilless mix, a lot of perlite in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of ... I'm not even going to tell
you too much of it, but I like a nice
[SPEAKER_06]: seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to veg them until they're about
three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to flower them at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll top them once toward their nice bush.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time they're done, they're about
six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to grow a big plant, but if I grow
my super silver haze that I've got in a
[SPEAKER_06]: pot that size ... Oh, excuse me,
I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I grow a super silver haystrain that I
have in a pot that size, it'll grow
[SPEAKER_06]: through the freaking ceiling in the 11
weeks that it takes to finish.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run more of those plants in smaller pots
because it's more as a grower that's
[SPEAKER_06]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's the most economical and
efficient way to run with that strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to time it because I have to count.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have so many numbers I can play with,
and if I want to do super silver haze for
[SPEAKER_06]: my guy that wants a straight up head race
in Sativa, I've got to plan nine of those
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of four, and that just messes up
my plant count already just for strain
[SPEAKER_06]: adjustment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Changing our numbers, it's going to mess
with us, and they're trying to stop us
[SPEAKER_06]: from being a lucrative enterprise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, being a caregiver, it nearly
cost me money to be a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: carrier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't make any money doing it,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are light bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spend a lot of time putting your guys'
medicine together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I would say I was to order something
that was, I don't know, 50% THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: 50% CBD, or whatever the profile is,
how long from me going, I want this,
[SPEAKER_04]: to you being able to produce it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have the strain that you want,
or do I need to create that for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just showed up and I'm a jerk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never mentioned it before,
and I want it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Breeding a strain is going to take me at
least ... Well, to breed it the first
[SPEAKER_06]: time, I've got to get the male.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to get the female.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I've got the male and female that
you're hoping I can ... I have to have the
[SPEAKER_06]: male and female, and I have to get them
both vegged big enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to flower them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The veg stage is probably two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flower stage is definitely two months,
maybe two and a half to three,
[SPEAKER_06]: depending because you've got to tell me
I'm a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on the strain and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at five months already.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to kick out seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant's got to dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pull the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking at another couple of few
weeks there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're half a year just making the first
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have to run those and share those
with other providers that can take a clone
[SPEAKER_06]: of that, so that if they find the champion
that you're looking for, then I can get a
[SPEAKER_06]: clone of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I need to breed that one to either
the male or the female again, the male
[SPEAKER_06]: again to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like year two now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going to take us a little
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have what you need at first,
but if I want to get it in seed form,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's solid for it to be out and
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at two, maybe three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be available to sample a little here
and there, but before it can be something
[SPEAKER_04]: that you could keep available steady form.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the rules are now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If all of a sudden every caregiver in
Colorado is limited to 30 or 36 plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: some areas have hard limited people,
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're working in Denver City and
County, you're limited to 12 plants per
[SPEAKER_04]: household, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: No exceptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many mother plants does some genetic
companies have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hundreds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Archive, I can't quote,
but I'm pretty sure Archive has about 18
[SPEAKER_06]: to 25 mother plants, Archive Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be way off then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Subcool probably has got 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking strains, not mother plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, mother plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like one seed company, like one seed
guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big guys like Swerve's probably got,
I'm just dropping names now, Swerve's
[SPEAKER_06]: probably got 35 mother plants that he
works with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two males and he reverses shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have to keep 35 females just to have
those for genetic supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stretching it though a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where all those crazy names come
from is all the hard work that these
[SPEAKER_04]: people are that we're describing right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read the summary of a
caregiver bill that's written by my
[SPEAKER_06]: friend, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Kevin, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the Kevin at the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to pronounce your last
name and I feel it'd be more polite just
[SPEAKER_06]: to create up say, I don't know how to
pronounce that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to meet you in person,
shake your hand and have you tell me how
[SPEAKER_06]: to say this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin is the political director for Pink
House Blooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a very educated and well written,
well spoken young man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reading from my iPhone, so excuse me
when I have to refine my spot several
[SPEAKER_06]: times.
[SPEAKER_06]: The current debate focused around
Colorado's marijuana caregivers is a
[SPEAKER_06]: result of a recent audit of the caregiver
program by the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_06]: Public Health and Environment and the
Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Department of Revenue is
attached to our marijuana system in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep good notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do keep very good notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throughout the process, there were several
shortcomings in regard to the
[SPEAKER_06]: enforceability of the program and the
overall implementation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Auditors discovered regulars were not
sufficiently overseeing doctors who issue
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendations to patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Caregivers were not given proper oversight
from the health department.
[SPEAKER_06]: Officials failed to issue red cards within
the constitutionally required 35 day
[SPEAKER_06]: timeline, which has been a problem since
day one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what sparked it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They audited because of this and then they
realized all the stuff that's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with part of it and we'll get on
to, I understand why.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not getting their cards in the
required time and also accused the health
[SPEAKER_06]: department of charging too much inpatient
application fees, which they have reduced
[SPEAKER_06]: to $15.
[SPEAKER_06]: It started off at 90 and went down to 35.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did something for indigent people and
now it's 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got an overage in their account of
10 or 13 million or something like that in
[SPEAKER_04]: state law for bids, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had to drop the fee over and over
and over again because they can't take in
[SPEAKER_04]: any more money legally until they spend
all the money they've already shaved out
[SPEAKER_04]: of the medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice little provision if you're a
taxpayer for sure or a red card holder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that the fee got cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like that the fee got cheaper?
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Department of Public Health and these
guys are plotting live in the studio here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Department of Public Health and
Environment generally agreed with the
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendations from the auditor's report
and are already taking steps to rectify
[SPEAKER_06]: the issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're considering redefining who is an
authorized CDPHE employee, which could
[SPEAKER_06]: mean increased access to private medical
marijuana records by independent
[SPEAKER_06]: contractors, limiting the number of
patients that private medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: caregivers can serve as well as putting a
cap on the number of plants that they can
serve.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to start things up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Larry Wolk, W-O-L-K of the Colorado
Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say CDPHE from now on to save
us all a headache.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Larry Wolk with the CDPHE along with
the state legislators are working to craft
[SPEAKER_06]: new laws clarifying their stance on
caregivers and home growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But House Speaker Mark F who does not good
with these names that are not English
[SPEAKER_06]: completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mark, I'm not going to fuck up your
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have respect for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark who decides which bills can be
considered said he won't allow a vote on
[SPEAKER_06]: the issue until medical marijuana
caregivers and patients are consulted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're going to kind of try to
listen to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've already raised a sting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had one public hearing already.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that a number of caregivers
stood up and spoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that a couple failed to put their
best foot forward, which was unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, they they went and
they set our piece and tried to explain to
[SPEAKER_04]: the legislature why limiting people in
this way is a terrible idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime government is between a patient
and a doctor, bad things tend to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's totally what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to tell you what your
prescription should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because in Colorado, we're not allowed
to have prescriptions for medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to have a recommendation and all
sorts of other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The legislature just realized that doctors
haven't been giving out the minimum per
[SPEAKER_04]: for everybody that for the 110,000 people
in the program, doctors have actually been
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to the patients, asking them how
much they consume, how often, and writing
[SPEAKER_04]: them a recommendation that's appropriate
to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they freaked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there are one or two examples that
they cite that are pretty egregious,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd admit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude with 100 or what, 501 plant
count.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's yes, it's federal limits.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are any federal plants is
illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they say they don't care if it's 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do if it's 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one dude with a 500 plant count card,
that's a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool because that's like the
guy when you're on the highway and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: that one guy in the yellow Camaro that
goes hauling ass past you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go enjoy that ticket and you know
you could just drive right by the cop
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's getting he's fucking with
that other guy already.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just let that guy with the 500
plants race right by us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only 24 caregivers in the whole
state, I think it said, that have more
[SPEAKER_04]: than five patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're they're making a huge stink out
of a pretty small problem for the most
[SPEAKER_04]: part.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: To change the rules for everybody and
screw up 12 years of good practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about that in a minute
here because that's I'm jumping ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, that's just the part I want to
rant about.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the result.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got to save the result after we
read, you know, you got to do all the math
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we'll summarize the results.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to read a little more.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one good paragraph.
[SPEAKER_06]: The caregiver issue has the marijuana
community split down the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry MMIG and CBA are both
supporting the CDPHE's efforts while
[SPEAKER_06]: patients and patient advocacy groups,
the patient advocacy groups, Patients Out
[SPEAKER_06]: of Time, Colorado Springs Medical
Marijuana Council, Coloradans for Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients' Rights and Green Faith
Ministries make up the opposition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many believe that groups such as MMIG and
CBA are only supportive of tighter
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations because, and this is what I'm
thinking, it will force patients into the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated market and in return increase
profits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those that are opposing efforts cited
doctor-patient relationships, privacy and
[SPEAKER_06]: compassion as areas of concern.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I think is going to happen here,
if they will limit my number of plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: all caregivers, not just myself,
they'll cut us down and it's going to make
[SPEAKER_06]: a short supply because there's already a
short supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: The supply in Colorado, it was tight
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm responding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever go anywhere else to get your
medical marijuana other than your
[SPEAKER_06]: caregiver?
[SPEAKER_04]: Only when I'm stuck out of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in Denver and you got carried
away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you, Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, but I work at a medical
marijuana dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to know about those products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it when you bring over some train
wreck like you did today to smoke me out
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's my responsibility to know
about what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not outside of market research though for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, outside of my work, I don't unless
I'm in Denver and I'm hitting the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensary hopping because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm out of town.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm getting at is you guys don't need
to go anywhere else because I do my best
[SPEAKER_06]: to even- Does his job very well,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I won't make dabs out of my
personal supply so that I've got that
[SPEAKER_06]: extra little bit because I know you guys
are going to ... I've got you timed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows strains for us that we like that
he doesn't so much care for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say on the air or was this a private
talk?
[SPEAKER_06]: I grow the Tora Bora like a boss and I do
not like growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally as a grower, as a cannabis
photographer, I don't like growing Tora
[SPEAKER_06]: Bora.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't grow well for my growing style,
my environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't get along with the rest of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't play the same, but these guys
love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of his patients love it and
so he keeps it around for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pain just goes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It harvests half as much as all of my
heavy hitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few strains that he does that
with which is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really gets our opinion, takes it to
heart and runs with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've said before, my joy is watching
people feel better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a friend who he's got a bad back.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got some sciatica.
[SPEAKER_06]: His legs are fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He walks with a cane.
[SPEAKER_06]: He showed up here in pain and we all hung
out and I got him nice and heavily
[SPEAKER_06]: medicated and he stood up to leave and the
old bastard forgot his cane.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how good he felt.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how good the man felt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That statement in itself is huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forgot his cane.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made that happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to say it, but the feeling
inside me was like, wow, he's walking
[SPEAKER_06]: upright.
[SPEAKER_06]: He forgot.
[SPEAKER_06]: He hurts.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a little bit of spiritual therapy
from hanging out with all of us for an
[SPEAKER_06]: hour or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of stuff is priceless.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they limit my grow or other
caregivers, because this isn't going to
[SPEAKER_06]: hurt me too much, honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem is that I've got mother plants
and I'm going to have to minimize mother
[SPEAKER_06]: plants to make this work or something
else, but I can adjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can roll with punches.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a grower does.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a breeder does.
[SPEAKER_06]: You fucking adapt, adjust, fucking move
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are going to be people that are not
as skilled.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not as educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They aren't as experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to be able to keep up
their supply for their patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen is these people are
going to have to go to a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_06]: but here's another fucked up issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: The medical marijuana dispensaries are
running out of medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: while the recreational dispensaries are
well stocked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mike, you're going to have to go,
I'm out of weed because they limited my
[SPEAKER_06]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have your ounce for this whatever
time period that we hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm not going to go to weights and
numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for you for not disclosing medical
information.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your monthly subscription, your monthly
prescription.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's half short because of these
new regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't adjusted my grow to that yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to go to the
dispensary to get a half a month supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real world implications of that on my
world are huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Financially, you're going to hurt me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cost increases, I almost don't want to
say, because you could kind of look it up
[SPEAKER_04]: if you really need your own fucking do
your homework people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will give you an example of how
jealous you should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would pay at least twice as much if I
had to fill my prescription at a retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: At a medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would pay twice as much at a medical
shop because of the taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost three times at a retail,
at a recreational shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm getting at is the medical shops
are out of weed and that's where most of
[SPEAKER_06]: the stuff that's there is tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a little ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's going to have to be tested
here real soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come July.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's for sure a reason those stores
charge what they charge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I provide you a strain specific product
that you have gotten to look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've gotten to trim with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've experienced that plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think part of you touching your
medicine, you guys have been involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to see it all the way through
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it better.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are connected to that as you consume
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a Rastafarian and I feel that that
touch, that connection makes the medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: work better for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're involved with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certain that's one of the reasons that
when I make concentrates from your
[SPEAKER_01]: material it's the most fun and I get the
best concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole process is just really awesome
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that it isn't always, but with your
material there's an extra level to that
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being able to watch these plants grow
and being so close to you and the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff, it makes it way more ... When
you guys ask me, how is the lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_06]: doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's week seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come look.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come take a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came over half a dozen times watching
the last batch of Grateful Dog come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you don't have any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just come stare at it for like four
minutes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've learned to eliminate a lot of these
sprays and things that I don't think I
[SPEAKER_06]: would want to consume in my hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I wouldn't mist it into the air and let
it land on my hash, I'm trying to get it
[SPEAKER_06]: out of my grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am seeing more and more companies,
more grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am privileged.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to go into grow rooms and I get to
see things that fucking civilians would
[SPEAKER_06]: shit their pants over, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see fluoramide.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fluoramide in a quart or pint container in
professional grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fluoramide is terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you spray fluoramide, I guess any time
is what I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in veg now, it's going to still
remain in your flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Harvest after flush, it'll be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be dabbing it most likely
if you're a future kid and you're dabbing
[SPEAKER_06]: neurotoxins on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this testing stuff we're talking
about would be available without
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys know I'm not fluoramide dabbing
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been watching you learn and whatnot
since pretty much the beginning,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, remember the time that I fucked up
one time really badly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the middle of winter and my gear
had switched.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Colorado, we get a heavy switch from
fall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Summer, fall, winter, it just goes boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be wearing shorts and a t-shirt and
then you're in fucking Eskimo boots and a
[SPEAKER_06]: snow hat, freezing your dick off.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time period, I got powdery mildew
from not adjusting and adapting to the
[SPEAKER_06]: rooms because I wasn't experienced in
Colorado to grow yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a four to five ounce white rhino
plant that had powdery mildew up the one
[SPEAKER_06]: side that was facing the wall because the
wall radiated cold and it made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that that time was not the
mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an amateur mistake, but your answer
to it, I totally remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: This night is it's one of the reasons that
I stopped really shopping anywhere else
[SPEAKER_04]: because I knew that whatever was coming
from your garden had this step in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched him take a set of shears,
cut the plant out of its pot and stuff it
[SPEAKER_04]: right in a big black trash bag and haul it
out of the house immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a four or five ounce plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had just trimmed two identical to it
that were perfectly healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That third one ran to the trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just no question, no thought to loss or
any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have watched other growers cut mold and
things out of plants and sell the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a medical marijuana caregiver and I
love the guys that I'm helping out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a big heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to thank for being such a big dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a big heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I would have given the old man I talked
about earlier that has a cane or my friend
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug that you guys know, or even you guys,
if I would have given you moldy weed with
[SPEAKER_06]: powdery mildew, glue in it, and in your
future, any of you get some sort of lung
[SPEAKER_06]: infection, I will think that was my fault
and I'll feel like shit forever for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not my job.
[SPEAKER_06]: My job is to keep you better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep all that shit out of your plants,
please, because for us extract artists,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be nightmare on equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be nightmare in the extracts first
and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sprays, no fucking mildew, no molds,
none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of people recently
saying, oh, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use it and just please don't throw it
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not worth the healthiest use of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard people tell me that the only
thing you can do with moldy pot is blast
[SPEAKER_04]: it into butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing you can do is throw it
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I throw up a little in my mouth when
people say stuff like that and I have to
[SPEAKER_04]: remember that I'm a peaceful person and I
should not scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard someone say the other day,
well, it kills it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, it concentrates it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making it concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of the pesticides, any of that nasty
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't even do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I say that the coolest thing to
come with legalization is lab testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lab testing has provided us so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the worst parts of the only real
dangers really of buying pot in the
[SPEAKER_04]: nineties was it might be moldy or it might
have powdery mildew in it or God only
[SPEAKER_04]: knows what they sprayed on it to get their
crop to harvest and now it's labeled,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's lab tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never tasted spider mites or spider mite
eggs or think that you're- Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody had their little, their old
wives' tale, old hippie tales about if it
[SPEAKER_04]: pops or if it sparkles or if it crackles
or if it burns black or- Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't miss those days at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect to all the pioneers and the
revolutionaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if you guys are here, my homie Task
Rock said, if you're here, it's likely
[SPEAKER_06]: you're a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is stage two of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are jumping into phase two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Phase one was, well, I'm going to say
we're phase two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task and Hellstone crew was phase one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We came in at phase two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you guys are phase three.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a fan, then it's likely you're a
pioneer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can look back on this day and say,
I was here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like we've been talking about me
growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that- Well, I mean,
the stuff they're talking about in the
[SPEAKER_04]: legislature right now screws with us on a
personal level every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about the medications you
take on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a bunch of Mountain Dew sitting
on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to- I do not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to mention that I have really quit
drinking Mountain Dew and I'm effing proud
[SPEAKER_06]: of myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a bad addiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fairly impressed as well as a serious
Mountain Dew addict, but think about some
[SPEAKER_04]: idiot in Congress toying with your drug
regimen every day on a personal medication
[SPEAKER_04]: level.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if your Xanax prescription was about
to go from three pills a day to one
[SPEAKER_04]: because somebody in Congress just realized
that doctors weren't giving out the bare
[SPEAKER_04]: minimum, regardless of what the patient
feedback was?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I told you, you can only take your
birth control pill on Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday, and Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many different medications?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Prozac's just two a day now because
the legislature really doesn't think you
[SPEAKER_04]: should be taking four a day, regardless of
how much your body actually needs or what
[SPEAKER_04]: your doctor has figured out for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually use marijuana for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was injured.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have nerve-generated pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can Google this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a pill that works great on
nerve-generated pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can swallow a Vicodin and I did for a
number of weeks after I got hurt and my
[SPEAKER_04]: arm still felt like it was stuck in a car
door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do a Jack the Ripper dab with
one of these Sweet Stone candies in my
[SPEAKER_06]: mouth and I can imagine it's going to be
fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep talking for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of you guys talk while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, along with a whole bunch of people in
Colorado, tried marijuana as a medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: for a medical effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just pictured you and a bunch of people
sitting down at the base of Buttermilk
[SPEAKER_06]: Mountain just lined up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all got together and we're like,
all right, everybody, don't take your pain
[SPEAKER_04]: medication today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all going to go do dabs and try that
for a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's essentially what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped taking pills for a day and just
smoked a little bit of pot in the morning
[SPEAKER_04]: and went about my day off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoked a lot of pot in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the day went on and I started to hurt
more, I'd smoke a little more and the pain
[SPEAKER_04]: would fade right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, I'm pain free and I was hurt
when I got here a few hours ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be a little sore again when I leave
so that I can drive safely home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the blood test and you're going to
submit yourself too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait until that happens on a legit
level.
I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm slightly afraid of needles,
but I've got tattoos and I've donated
[SPEAKER_06]: plasma so I think I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make them write you a note for the track
marks.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I want to mention before we quit
ranting about me and growing and I want to
[SPEAKER_06]: get onto the next subject here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of the places that people
get problems from their plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: their bugs often come from clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're bringing in bugs when you bring in
clones from other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome to trade clones, but be
careful, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inspect that shit the best that you can
and have some sort of organic regimen to
[SPEAKER_06]: get rid of those spider mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quarantine that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spider mites are the most common and also
one of the most fucking pesky.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why seed is so awesome and why
plant count limits of three and six and 30
[SPEAKER_04]: are so restrictive is because I got to
order 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to pop all 10 of them and there's a
third of what you're allowed to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you got to take clones of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right from those 10 seeds, you might get
one or two that you keep, but until you
[SPEAKER_04]: figure that out, you've got to check off
off your count.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry not to stick on this one topic,
but it's one I've been watching all week
[SPEAKER_04]: and it just strikes a nerve.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can tell it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse my cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for an article I've got saved
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you reaching for, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do this thing with my headphone jack
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tap him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make him get live again.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slowly rotating and when it's not in
the sweet spot, the sound bounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: It bounces from right to left in my
headphones and it's disorienting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to explain exactly how.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been our longest episode so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of proud of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, lots of talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every episode I tried to do a segment that
I call Give Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our second installment of Give
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pulled the word installment right out of
my ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope somebody saw that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It flew out like a big purple unicorn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not need to visualize that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big purple unicorn coming at the horn got
me good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to get seriously now and pay
respects and give thanks to everybody's
[SPEAKER_06]: favorite Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Herrera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I better not say Herrera.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to say Herrera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody pronounces it differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even attempt it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know that I used to think that it
was like short for Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was from the same offshoot because
where we're from, that's a popular name.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Herrera and not Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to try and say it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to retrain my brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my excuse.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jack Herrera, I want to give you
thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're crucial to the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read a little bit about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is mostly from Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Herrera was born in June 18th of
1939, sometimes called the Emperor of
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Herrera was an American cannabis
activist and the author of The Emperor
[SPEAKER_06]: Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A book still worth buying and reading,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have one at work signed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this book, why is it worth buying and
reading?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys want to elaborate on that for me
for a minute?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fantastic history of hemp in the US
and across the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you should read it as the short
version.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's used to back up the legalized
cannabis talks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a lot of reasons, like useful
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got things in the front that I don't
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been 15 years since I've read this
book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I feel bad for not being prepared,
but it's essentially a challenge for an
[SPEAKER_04]: insane amount of money that if you can
disprove anything in this book,
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give you a huge amount of money and
no one ever attempted to claim it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't disprove anything he
says.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really the pioneer book about
cannabis and all of the medical and
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial uses in a time when knowing a
bunch about marijuana was a criminal
[SPEAKER_04]: offense, essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like your, you know some shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Herrera was out of a really high
knee.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw your eyes roll back in your head and
you just started going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to dig through a hash ball to get
it, but I got it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack wrote two books.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wrote, of course, The Emperor Wears
Knows Clothes, which we've been ranting
[SPEAKER_06]: about, and also a book called Grass.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a documentary about him
called The Emperor of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack believed, Jack Herrera believed that
cannabis plants should be criminalized
[SPEAKER_06]: because, sorry, I got the sweet stone in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to move it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: He believed the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like five or six little ones in
this package and I'm just savoring every
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking lick of that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He felt the cannabis plant should be
decriminalized because it has been shown
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a renewable source of fuel,
food, and medicine that can be grown in
[SPEAKER_06]: ritual any part of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: He further asserts that the US government
deliberately hides his proof.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a strain of Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wikipedia mentions that error.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I should mention that that strain was
absolutely not his favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't even very fond of it,
which is kind of ironic in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like most strains named after people,
the people they're named after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never interact with the person attempting
to honor them in any way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Loud Seeds and Ganja Farmer OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually collaborated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the Ganja Farmer OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not surprise me that you know
the example that breaks the rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Loud is a great breeding company and they
were all over the cannabis cup last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everywhere you looked is loud,
loud, loud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Marlon Asher is a reggae artist that
sings Ganja Farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course somebody to know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys know that Herrera ran for the
United States president twice in 1998 and
[SPEAKER_06]: 1992 as a grassroots party candidate?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not have told you the years,
but I knew that that was one of the stunts
[SPEAKER_04]: that he pulled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, in July of 2000,
he suffered a minor heart attack and a
[SPEAKER_06]: major stroke resulting in difficulty
speaking and moving the right side of his
[SPEAKER_06]: body.
[SPEAKER_06]: He mostly recovered, but on September
12th, 2009, he suffered another heart
[SPEAKER_06]: attack while backstage at the Hempstock
Festival in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: He spent a month in critical condition in
a Portland hospital.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a medically induced coma, he was
discharged to another facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul Stanford of the Hemp and Cannabis
Foundation said that he's waking up and
[SPEAKER_06]: gazing appropriately when someone is
talking, but he's not really communicating
[SPEAKER_06]: in any way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately he'd passed away at the
age of 70 on April 15th of 2010 in Eugene,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon from complications related to the
September 2009 heart attack.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was buried in Mission Hills,
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more little piece of info on August
12th of 2012, a video was uploaded to
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube of a man named Rick Simpson
claiming that Jack passed the torch of
[SPEAKER_06]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sweet stones got my mouth all
delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking buy them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rick Simpson claims that Jack passed the
torch of legislation to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thank you for your life's work,
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I want to mention one funny thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a guy named Jeff McElroy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is running for the mayor of Toronto,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not an endorsement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, not an endorsement.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just how this story starts.
[SPEAKER_06]: His campaign sign, he's got these big,
they're six feet wide and I think they're
[SPEAKER_06]: six feet tall, but they're like a plywood
sheet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's only like it's got posts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's only half of the width that it is
wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty burly campaign sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the little plastic one on the
wires.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's as wide as your car.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this sign, the sign reads Jeff
McElroy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He promises to just smoke pot as mayor,
not crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone's better than Rob Ford.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you get that, you get that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that Rob Ford's approval ratings
have gone up or remained steady since the
[SPEAKER_04]: scandal broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out in Canada, no one really
cares what you smoke as long as you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: screw with them too much from a government
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more piece of information that I feel
like we should share with the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're coming to you from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got to go some places sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't make me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The look on your face is pretty,
pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I had this conversation yesterday with
the wife and I really don't want to leave
[SPEAKER_04]: without some serious, serious,
tempting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's got to be a pretty happy
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, go on with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're drive this man, several people
apparently have reported that they were in
[SPEAKER_06]: Idaho driving with Colorado license plates
and they are harassed by the police.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pulled over and the cops harassed them
about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're driving cool, but they,
and this is allegedly, I am not in
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody's shoes here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reading a story from the cannabis is
actually where I found this because if you
[SPEAKER_06]: want cannabis news and you don't feel like
hearing me rattle it off and stutter it,
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis has a lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend, Kevin that works with pink
house also sends me a lot of great info
[SPEAKER_06]: and I scour the web for this stuff to find
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got something you want to hear,
feel free to tweet it to me at I grow
[SPEAKER_06]: culture and I'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would love to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's going on in Idaho?
[SPEAKER_06]: These cops are pulling me over and fucking
with you because you got Colorado plates.
[SPEAKER_06]: One guy, they detained him and they took
his car to the police station and had six
[SPEAKER_06]: cops search his car for six hours and they
didn't find anything, but the cop treated
[SPEAKER_06]: him like a prick the entire time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was real accusatory that the man was
carrying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turns out the guy was an affluent
businessman and has a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now he's sparking up a lawsuit against
the police force that harassed him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't wait to see how that turns out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This story is making the rounds this week,
but it's really just the latest example of
[SPEAKER_04]: this happening in all the states around
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been getting worse since we first
passed our medical marijuana laws back in
[SPEAKER_04]: 1999, or at least after the dispensary
explosion in 2008 is when it got real bad
[SPEAKER_04]: is Colorado license plates are like a big
target on your back.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're out of state, you're going to
get pulled over at some point or people
[SPEAKER_04]: have been alleging this for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a video of it that you can pull of
people trying to record these encounters.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a number of testimonies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd suppose you'd call them that have been
put up on the web of people being pulled
[SPEAKER_04]: over and harassed for hours, searched
extensively for marijuana or other drugs
[SPEAKER_04]: because they've got Colorado plates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mention what happened in Texas,
and this will be our last little segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other states along the southern border,
especially, there's been a number of cases
[SPEAKER_04]: in the last six months or a year or so of
troopers pulling over people, not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily with Colorado plates,
plates from anywhere and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the person says, I'm sorry,
officer, I don't have any drugs or
[SPEAKER_04]: contraband, the cop essentially keeps
insisting you have drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in a number of examples,
an example recorded on a dash cam,
[SPEAKER_04]: an officer performs vaginal and anal
cavity searches on an aunt and a niece at
[SPEAKER_04]: the same time on the side of the road
without changing their glove.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just take a minute and throw up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to make this nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the side of a public highway
in Texas.
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: A cop car, your car, these ladies' car on
the side of the highway, lights are
[SPEAKER_06]: flashing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aunt and niece on the side of the highway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a 40-year-old and a 20-year-old
female.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably handcuffed, feeling humiliated,
scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrified.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they were handcuffed,
but they definitely were humiliated and
[SPEAKER_04]: terrified.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this officer, I don't know if it was a
trooper or a state patrol or what they
[SPEAKER_06]: were, this dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Member of law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_06]: This Leo is what we call them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took a rubber glove, put it on one hand,
one glove.
[SPEAKER_06]: One glove on one hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it in suspect number one's vagina.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Proceeded to spin suspect number one and
then dig in person's anus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So front to back action here with the same
glove.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same glove.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now here's the best part that I want to
clear up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Went to the next suspect, which is now I'm
calling a victim because you're being
[SPEAKER_06]: raped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fingers in the butt to see if you got
drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fingers in the vagina to see if you got
drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was the reverse order,
but yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, that glove's been in your
friend's butthole.
[SPEAKER_04]: That same glove, four orifices,
two people.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this, I feel is... How many
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you count the bacteria that got moved
around in that transaction?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: If one of us did it, we'd be charged with
forcible rape on two victims.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some sort of... The fact that it
happened on the highway just because the
[SPEAKER_04]: cop felt like pulling him over and going,
I think you've got drugs is appalling.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Land of the free, home of the brave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're clearly terrified if we're raping
women on the side of the highway with the
[SPEAKER_04]: same glove, looking for a little weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much drugs could you have in a vagina?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that warrant any of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this isn't an isolated example.
[SPEAKER_04]: When these stories break, a number of
people come forward and say, that happened
[SPEAKER_04]: to me last October.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can look all this stuff online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please Google anything I've said tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I challenge you to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want you to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a little bit of a disgusting
note to end on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hate to take it there,
but we're spoiled in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have access to legal, regulated,
well done marijuana that's produced and
[SPEAKER_04]: sold just about like every other product
on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we enjoy safety and oversight that you
don't get in the majority of the other 49
[SPEAKER_04]: states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also enjoy freedom from persecution
because of our use of this beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I want everybody to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't want the new caregiver law to
pass, I want you to call the state reps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm an idiot and I don't have that
phone number available.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to look through my phone and
I feel like I got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can Google the rep for your area real
quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm going to do, I will tweet it at
igrowculture on Twitter and I'll get that
[SPEAKER_06]: number out for you guys to call.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm writing a note to do that because I'm
a pothead and I'm forgetful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But do your best to contact your local
Colorado rep and tell them not to change
[SPEAKER_06]: the caregiver account and let us do what
we're doing because we're not fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to help sick people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every rep in Colorado has a webpage with a
button on it to make it easy to email
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our responsibility to fight for what
we want.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our responsibility to stand up and
speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: If nobody speaks up, nobody speaks up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when one of us speaks up and you see
your buddy speaking up, it's that much
[SPEAKER_06]: easier to speak up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go first.
[SPEAKER_04]: What traditionally happens is the people
who are terrified of marijuana write five
[SPEAKER_04]: emails and the people who have done their
homework and know what it's capable of
[SPEAKER_04]: doing and helping with and all the
positive that can come from it are too
[SPEAKER_04]: busy working to send an email and it's
sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send more emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Contact your legislators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legislators.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got cod mouth real bad and my
tongue's not cooperating.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means I'm doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've succeeded, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Success.
[SPEAKER_06]: Victory is mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to pull up the outro song,
but I'm going to just have to... Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reaching.
I'm reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night, everybody.

[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned them earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awesome place to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a question on the cannabis that
you mentioned earlier about what we get to
[SPEAKER_04]: see tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that answer to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the answer to that.

you want to say specifically?

that podcasting thing before I go and try
[SPEAKER_06]: to get people on that are going to feel
like an asshole on my show.
Test run.
