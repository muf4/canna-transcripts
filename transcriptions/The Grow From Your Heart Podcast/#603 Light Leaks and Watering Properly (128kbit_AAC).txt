[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you from a cold Colorado
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super cold here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to complain about the
weather for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the main topic of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been brought to my attention that I
talk about light leaks on this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been told that I have never told
you what a light leak officially is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start off by talking
about light leaks in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about, let's jump right into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a light leak?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are growing cannabis plants,
those plants do need a dark cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to initiate the flowering
period of cannabis plants, of photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got auto flowers, this is a
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm going to talk about photo
period cannabis plants for this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're growing photo period cannabis
plants, those plants require an amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time of uninterrupted total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean complete total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face, it is too bright in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to stand in that room for a few
minutes and let your eyes adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your eyes adjust, put your hand
in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can see your hand, there is too
much light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need complete total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the 12 hour dark cycle,
which we give our plants to initiate them
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower, most people do a 12 hours on,
12 hours off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 24 hour day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awake for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sleep for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 12 hour uninterrupted dark period
will trigger our plants to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is very important that we do not
interrupt that dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I call a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get light into the night cycle of
the plants, we don't want to wake the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to disrupt their sleep
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we disrupt that sleep cycle,
we can cause problems with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cause minor problems or we can
cause major problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on when these light leaks
happen, depending on how long,
[SPEAKER_00]: how often they happen, that will depend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it will depend on the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those genetics have a tendency to have
problems due to light leaks or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the things we can see if we do cause
light leaks in our grow can be things like
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can trigger the plants to throw
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally in nature, once the sun goes
down, it's fucking dark until the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if one day the sun came
up in the middle of the night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole rhythm, your whole life would
freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would go into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if some lights come on in the
middle of the night in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say, why is the sun
coming up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weird stress, that weird panic mode
often causes plants to throw intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their goal is to reproduce so they can be
grown next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're pollinated, then they are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't going to pollinate these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do give them some stress,
they may decide, hey, the end is near or
[SPEAKER_00]: something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better do what I can do to make sure I
have self preservation so I can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it will show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pollinate itself and we will have
seeded hermaphroditic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not get light leaks into the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those lights go off, leave the lights
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in there and take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't turn on a light to show one of your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave them in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cause intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also cause them to not flower at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a light shining into your
grow room when you think it is the dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, those plants just won't go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have turned your timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be waiting and waiting and waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually about 10 to 14, maybe 12 ish
days in when we start seeing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: actually showing us that they are in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been in flower for 14,
15, 16 days and you're not seeing any
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of flower, there is a light leak in
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting light when it should be
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something else that can happen
depending on when the light leak,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light interruptions do happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can re-veg your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants can be in flower for a number
of weeks and then something goes wrong to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are getting a light leak that
you don't even know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're getting extra light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants may go back into the
vegetative stage and they won't even
[SPEAKER_00]: finish flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have these weird funky looking buds
and you'll have plants with twisted world
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and you'll be like, what the heck
is going on in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're going to do a test and
you should do this test long before you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's how to test if you have a light
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in the grow room, turn off all of the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to hang out in that room for five,
10, maybe 15 minutes and allow your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeballs to adjust to that total pitch
black, dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point, hold your hand in front
of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand or any movement,
I'm white and pasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light is going to reflect off of my
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see any light in that room,
it is too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need 100% pitch black total darkness in
this night period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say a light leak, I am talking
about an interruption of the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be opening the door and getting
light from the other room in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a hole in some of your ducting
or a hole in your tent that is letting
[SPEAKER_00]: light from the other room blatantly into
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see that light leak cause
a hermaphroditic issue right where the
[SPEAKER_00]: light is hitting your bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one little bud is going to throw male
flowers and it may pollinate, it may
[SPEAKER_00]: create seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful when it comes to light
leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want light leaks in our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've talked about light leaks a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to stand in the grow room and make
sure it is totally dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not totally dark, we need to
correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may notice is that some of
the equipment in your grow room may be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting off light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the grow equipment that we buy has
blue LED lighting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it has red lighting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only light that is acceptable in that
grow room is a green LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since plants are green, they are not
affected by green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just reflect the green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a green LED light,
that is the only light that is acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us have equipment with a power
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plug it in, this little light
comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a red light, if you've got a
blue light on any of your equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is time to get some black duct tape or
something similar and cover that light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not need any lights happening in our
grow while the plants are trying to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover up all those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a green light, that light
will be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is an LED, we can use green LEDs,
but don't use a white light with a green
[SPEAKER_00]: painted bubble over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light coming out is not really green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a green bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using any sort of lights in
there, it should be a green LED with green
[SPEAKER_00]: diodes, not green bulbs, not painted green
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually want green light, not green
glass to keep those plants in an
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that was brought to my attention
is if you are using an AC infinity fan
[SPEAKER_00]: speed controller, sometimes those will
come on the little controller box with the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that comes on randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may think that that controller is
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little button to turn off the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been brought to my attention that
occasionally that thing will light up
[SPEAKER_00]: during the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go in the grow room the next
day, that light is on and you had no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the AC infinity fan speed
controller with the display on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to make a little light
baffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can simply get something like a piece
of cardboard, a piece of a, a piece of a
[SPEAKER_00]: shoe box and just cut a little flap and
tape that flap right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where you can lift it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust and look at your clock
settings and look at what you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust, put the flap right back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got another creative method
of doing so, but let's cover all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment that is putting off LED red,
blue, purple lighting in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not need that lighting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to cause us problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is a green LED, that is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand sometimes we do need to
go in the grow room during the dark cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're hanging out and you heard a
word, heard a weird bumping noise or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the air conditioner didn't come on or
maybe you forgot something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you left your phone in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if it is the dark period,
don't be in there with your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That counts as light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people in the grow room and
they're like, I'll just use my light as a
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight and I won't disrupt the plants,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are waking up from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't answer your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use your phone as a flashlight in
the grow room in the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go in the grow during a
dark period, I highly recommend having
[SPEAKER_00]: green LED lights as your work lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good idea just to replace every
bulb in there with a green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't just use green light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to actually be putting out green
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the painted bulbs I don't trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely prefer a green diode
LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to work in there,
get yourself a green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wear the headlamp with the
green headlamp on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the light is shining wherever
you're looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can highlight your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of makes me feel weird in there
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather have the green LEDs above
me so that I can see the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something creepy about not being able
to see over here but only being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: see in front of me in the dark messes with
my perception and just feels kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: creepy to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid of the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm afraid of the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is do not interrupt that dark
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you interrupt that dark cycle,
that is what I am calling a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fully dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got some light coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like having an aquarium with a
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is getting out or the water is
getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting light in or out when we
don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a light leak and it can cause
great problems to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your genetics, a small light
leak could be seriously detrimental or a
[SPEAKER_00]: small light leak may be just a tiny
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's avoid all of the problems we can
by understanding light leaks and avoiding
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered that quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll cause hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll cause your plants not to flower
and they can also cause your plant to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a revenge situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention that some of your equipment
may have lights on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the fans we buy with a timer,
if you can set a timer on your fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably got a red light on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go and put some tape over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the extension cords we buy have
lights on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the little on-off switch and it's
either red or blue or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that light switch or that
little switch, the on-off switch with the
[SPEAKER_00]: light on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the power strips that we buy light
up when we plug them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thin clear plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plug it in, the whole strip
lights up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of that piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a dark colored power strip,
a black one so the light won't shine
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have a little light on the
end to indicate that they're giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a screwdriver and fucking puncture
that light bulb or put some tape over it
[SPEAKER_00]: or drill through it or get some pliers and
pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruin that light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need extra light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only light we want is from our grow
lights unless again it is a green LED
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered that part
excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I made my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light leaks are when we get light in in
the dark period and it disrupts our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to touch on is
watering technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I was helping somebody do a
consultation for a grow and I said just
[SPEAKER_00]: show me what you do in here and I just
kind of hang out while they do their thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and I learned what is going wrong in their
grow by watching what they're doing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched this person get their watering
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just scoop water up out of a bucket
and then they poured the water basically
[SPEAKER_00]: down the stock of the plant right into the
middle of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a seven gallon pot that's full
of, it was a soilless mix, so they got,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's filled with a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven gallons of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a good sized plant coming out of
there and they are watering the direct
[SPEAKER_00]: center of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got this big seven gallon pot and
they just poured, I'm gonna guess a seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot is 18 inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's close enough even if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They watered a four to six inch circle in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about all this other 14,
10 inches on the outside that didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: water?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all of our roots are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to fill that entire pot with
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't provide water to that outer
edge, how's it gonna get wet?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the roots gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna grow out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just gonna have, I bet that my
friend's plants only have root balls that
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably eight to 10 inches around and
the depth of the pot when most people
[SPEAKER_00]: could achieve a full root bound pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole pot should be filled with roots
by the time this plant is done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're not watering it,
those roots will not go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, ah, it's dry over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay over here where it's wet
because he's only watering in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the shape of an untapped,
untrained, unmanipulated cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you visualize that plant in your head,
it's shaped like a Christmas tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's skinny at the top and it gets wider
as it goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the shape of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are hanging down a little bit,
kind of acting like shingles on a roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one leaf hangs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hanging down at an angle and if water
were to land on the top of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water would run down that top leaf and
then it would fall onto another leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: it would run down and as it runs down,
it is also moving outward because the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches are getting wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs down and out, down and out until
it gets to the bottom because of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that water going to end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we picture water falling from above on
a cannabis plant, if you really think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, everything directly underneath
the plant will remain dry unless we get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is the area right
around the plant where those leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch out to, all of that is going to
get heavily saturated with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those roots are going to say,
look at all this water out here and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to grow and they're going to
expand and they're going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching out until they don't see any
more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen in your container
is they're going to go right up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and they're going to circle back
around and they're going to keep circling
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and you will fill that entire
container with big fat white roots and big
[SPEAKER_00]: fat white roots will give you big fat
green fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big fat healthy root
system, you can create a bigger fatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are watering, my point of this
is don't water the very center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water the outside edge of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a new plant, a baby plant
that's just adjusting to its space,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, water in the middle where the plant
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it grows, as the roots grow,
as the root mass expands, water outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water more of that space where the fresh
roots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to increase the amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy was only pouring enough water in
to actually water the area where the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: probably exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him if he watered the entire thing
and got about 10 to 20% runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots would grow more rapidly,
more vigor, vigorously, and it would just
[SPEAKER_00]: fill and occupy that entire plant,
which would give them a healthier,
[SPEAKER_00]: happier plant, which produces bigger
fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we are all after,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it, do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop watering the dead center of the
plant and let's start watering outward so
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of those roots can get some
moisture and get a little bit of a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more quick thing I want to
rant about, and then we're going to wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: this one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I saw on social media was
somebody asking about a new brand of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: they can buy because this brand that they
have been buying is riddled with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to blame the brand of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of people wanted to back
them up on the Facebook feed because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how social media works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say that you cannot blame
any brand of soil for having bugs in it
[SPEAKER_00]: because all brands of soil can potentially
and probably do have bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening at the factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening where the soil is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, but most likely it's
happening somewhere in shipping or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: storage dock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that the people that make that
soil do their best to keep it bug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these bags of soil are made in bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made in mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to sit on a dock or in a
warehouse or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to a few grow stores where they
store the soil in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just right on the dirt in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be a stack of your favorite
soil, just two pallets of it stacked up
[SPEAKER_00]: eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next to that will be two
pallets stacked up eight feet tall of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next to that will be another
soil that neither one of us have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of, but it's stacked up eight feet
tall on two pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all out in the backyard of this
grow store or out in the backyard of this
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse because they can't store it all
indoors and soil can be stored outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when all of that shit is sitting
outdoors, that's when it is getting bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that the bugs are going
to just say, I want this dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go, no, there's a home
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a home here and there's a home
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get into all those bags
of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a comfy environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and cozy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start partying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to hump and they're
going to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there were only bugs in pile A at
the beginning, but after a little while,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of eating and reproducing,
they wanted to go find more people to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: and reproduce with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're in pile two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're in pile three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bugs are not in one specific brand
of soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs are moving around in all of the
brands of soil and soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening in the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening in the dock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening in transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening in shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many opportunities for these
bugs to jump into the soil bags and we
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot blame the soil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not even happen anywhere near the
soil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have happened at the grow store
that sold it to you, which is as far down
[SPEAKER_00]: the line from the company as you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stop blaming the companies for
having bugs in the soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that you should expect
from all companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a farmer, it is your responsibility
to make sure there are no pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are pests, it's your
responsibility to treat appropriately to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that those pests don't infest our
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the responsibility of the
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't put a bag of dirt in a bag and
ship it across the country on a truck and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it sit in a dock and promise you that
no bugs can get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it is the growers
responsibility to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we put into our garden are clean
and safe and pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inspect your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get soil and you see things flying
out of it, you've obviously got some
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see a lot of the insects until
it's too late, but pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see any soil borne pests,
it is time to treat that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wonder, how can I get the
bugs out of my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common, you can use predator
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common way to get rid of most
bugs in a commercial environment is to use
[SPEAKER_00]: BT, bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have that printed anywhere,
but that is the most common way to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of most pests in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product is available in many
different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosquito dunks are very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these products called mosquito
dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at your local hardware
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Target probably has them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grocery store probably has them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come on a red package with yellow
writing, yellow and white writing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it simply says mosquito dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a little donut or a shitty
cookie, but do not eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beneficial fungus and I think they
are delivered on, I think it's like ground
[SPEAKER_00]: corn or some sort of a grain, but it's
dried and it's got this bacteria on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these donut-shaped discs and I
usually put them in a baggie and I wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: the baggie in a newspaper and I crush it
with a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to break the baggie and
rupture the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to hit it hard enough to
crumble it up into a dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that dust into my water that
I'm going to water my plants and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: water that through the soil and that puts
the BT into my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will destroy, eradicate most of the
bugs that come with your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the BT doesn't get rid of them,
that's when I recommend doing either an
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen or botanogard max soil dredge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mix up the appropriate amount of
pesticide, depending on which pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: you've chosen to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that up with some water and simply
feed that through your plants until you
[SPEAKER_00]: get slight runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got that pesticide in there in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your plants are nice and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't cause too much damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will only take a day or two for them to
recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue on with your normal watering
cycle and hopefully one or two soil
[SPEAKER_00]: dredges of either botanogard max or
evergreen will eradicate almost any soil
[SPEAKER_00]: borne pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you may want to spray at the same
time if you think you've got a soil borne
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you've got thrips in there,
if you think you've got spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray at the same time as you do your
dredge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit them from all angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way those bugs have nowhere to go and
you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to stop blaming soil
companies, cocoa companies, for sabotaging
[SPEAKER_00]: our gardens because we got bugs in a bag
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect the bugs in the bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens in shipping and
transport and storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your responsibility as the gardener
to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'm going to take a sip and I'm
going to talk about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sips water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want to talk about is
rinsing our cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get bags of cocoa, that cocoa has
been, it came from another country,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably Malaysia, Thailand, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cocoa came on a boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows when they packed up that cocoa
if they used salt water or if it was on a
[SPEAKER_00]: boat that got a lot of condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the cocoa we get is filled with
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to rinse the cocoa before we
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got several ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put all of your cocoa into a giant
container and just hose it down and just
[SPEAKER_00]: rinse it until you get runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can put it in the pots that you're
going to plant your plants into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mix it with perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the perlite and the amendments
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can put it directly into your
pots, your threes, your fives,
[SPEAKER_00]: or your sevens, whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then rinse that while it's in the pot
until you get plenty of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost check to see what the PPMs
or EC of that runoff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it super low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there's not a lot of salt in
there before we put our plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not rinse your cocoa and you
put your plants in the cocoa and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing weird problems with your plants,
if they're getting kind of clawy,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the leaves are going different
directions, you're getting world leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're getting odd colors,
you're getting crispiness, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was a bunch of salt in that
cocoa and the plants are pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get rinsed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just ate all of the salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine what your mouth tastes like
if you were just buried in salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we got to hydrate the plants,
get the salt out of there, and start
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them an appropriate diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That salt's going to mess with your pH,
your EC, and the overall health of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, rinse your cocoa before using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the higher-end brands don't
require as much rinsing, but I still do
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend a quick rinse, whatever brand
you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that is all I have got
for you for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was quick.
