[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call these Thursday episodes the
Thursday Quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
Quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, welcome to a
Thursday Quickie episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and keep this quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these episodes by letting
you know what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am dabbing on some Titan OG from
our friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Titan OG Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice and smells like nice OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice battery texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been dunking this into the Aloha
Limone High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract Crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a tremendous combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has given me some amazing cotton mouth,
so I apologize if I sound all dry-mouthed
[SPEAKER_00]: and weird on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to blame it on the amazing
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep these episodes quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read some emails, so let's get
right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a bad decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever made that decision, they're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I wanted to write back
and let you know the suggestions you made
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought my pH up to 6.3, and I'm giving
more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Ohio, and I don't have anyone
around me who grows, so the little,
[SPEAKER_00]: quick, weird questions are quickest
answered by the experienced guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy actually sent us an email
recently saying that he was having some
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with his plants, and I
recommended that he adjust his pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: change his feet a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I nailed his problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are looking better,
so that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email also goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, got another question if you have
the time, good sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to step into the world of
mostly sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a recommendation or maybe a
genetic that would fit the mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have to be a strain that's a
little forgiving since it's my first go at
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for a couple of years,
but I have limited myself to mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: indicas because of growth size
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be grown in a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is how tall is your three by
three?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much height do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much ceiling space do you have from
the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say sativas, do you mean like a
crazy sativa, like a 14 or 16 week sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you just mean like a nine or 10 or
maybe an 11 week sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of factors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go really long hazy stuff like a
super silver haze or a Neville's haze or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that if you want to go
really long, or if you just want nine or
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 weeks, maybe something like super lemon
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't as long and very much more
sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something from my lineup,
I would recommend either the Storm Shadow
[SPEAKER_00]: or the Scarlet Begonias would be a tall,
long flower sativa that would work well
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to know how tall your space is
because you're going to have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing with this is if you're going to
grow from seed or clone, you decide when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to flip the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow it to be six inches tall
and then flower it and it will fit in any
[SPEAKER_00]: space you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be able to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just got to plan ahead and know
what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want like a 10 weeker,
I'd say go with six Scarlet Begonias or
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for longer, then you're
going to want to start looking into
[SPEAKER_00]: something with the word haze in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hazes are going to take longer to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a really cool option or an
opportunity for you to grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some seeds that are sativa
dominant and then you can find the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that grows well for your limited space and
you can find the one that takes exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how long you want it to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good opportunity to grow from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good sativa is going to take you
anywhere between 10 and 14, maybe 16 weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what you decide to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to cut down a sativa
too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always better when things finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to veg for a couple of
weeks and then you're going to flower for
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 14 weeks, why not wait that extra
week and let it get all the way done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't rush yourself with a sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for strain recommendations,
it's hard to know what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your flavor profile is going to be,
how you want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got that small space,
but if you want something that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go like 10 or 11 weeks, maybe 12 weeks,
like nine or 10 weeks, I'd say look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: storm shadow, maybe 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go maybe a little longer,
maybe check out Brothers Grimm's Cindy 99
[SPEAKER_00]: or their new Durban poison that's coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may take you a little longer,
10, 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some Durban poison seeds take me
14 weeks and I cut them down and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere near done, but they produced buds
that were longer than my arms and I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tall guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got long monkey arms and those
buds were as long as my arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want longer flowering stuff,
things with the word haze in it are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually going to be sativa heavy that will
take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super silver haze, Aryan's haze,
Neville's haze, a lot of the haze stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: will take a lot longer to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word haze usually indicates long
finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say go to the Helladank seed bank
and check out some breeders there and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if anything catches your eye and look at
long flowering sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to do it to see what
gets your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great opportunity to grow from
seed because you'll be able to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll be able to narrow it down to
the phenotype you want and then you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have the sativa that grows well in your
environment and does what you need it to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more of this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I grow for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bipolar, depression, as well as
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on many different prescriptions for
major depression, anxiety, antipsychotics
[SPEAKER_00]: for sleep, and it straight up sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: At times the side effects were horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds like that could be
horrible when you're taking that many
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that they would start
battling each other eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're taking one to do this and the
other one will do this and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to mix and do shit you didn't
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could only imagine how terrible that
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email also goes on to say,
I did that vicious circle for a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: then broke down after 29 years of being
completely anti-weed and I tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now 31 and after two years,
I'm happy to say I'm on zero pills and I
[SPEAKER_00]: am straight cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy used to be on, let's see,
he's got bipolar, depression, and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on different prescriptions for
major anxiety, depression, and
[SPEAKER_00]: antipsychotics for sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on three different pills that he
mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't say what they were,
but now he's on zero pills and straight
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next sentence of his email is the most
important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, weed saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person went 29 years without
consuming cannabis and was having major
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health concerns and issues and now
they're consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past two years, they've been happy
and they're pill free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're prescription free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis saved this person's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably said their name on the last
time I read their email, but hey dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for sharing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot to open up and let out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really glad that you were on Team
Cannabis now and I'm really glad that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis saved your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email keeps going and it just gets
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I can now function, laugh,
smile, and be around my wife and three
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing little boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this guy eliminated
prescriptions and is treating his mental
[SPEAKER_00]: health with cannabis and it is allowing
him to be happy for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't say they're happy and not
mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's able to function, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes mental health will stop you from
being able to basically function.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do your daily shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put your fucking shoes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do what needs to be done because
you're depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're overwhelmed by these disgusting
feelings that come through your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've faced it, you have no idea
what it's like and this person is fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can function.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can laugh and he can smile,
which is beyond functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is improving the quality of this
man's life and he's able to be around his
[SPEAKER_00]: wife and three amazing little boys,
which means cannabis is improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: lives of five people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably spiraling out, rippling out to
more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably improving grandma's life,
grandpa's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's happier because this guy's
consuming cannabis and keeping his mental
[SPEAKER_00]: health in check without taking damaging
prescriptions, nasty addictions,
[SPEAKER_00]: addictive prescriptions that are probably
causing more problems than they were
[SPEAKER_00]: helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy has changed his life by using
cannabis and he was kind enough to share
[SPEAKER_00]: this information with us, which is a
tremendous story and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says growing is one of the most
rewarding things I've done for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for being kind enough to
answer some of my questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yourself in a very big way is contributing
to steady increase in mental health and
[SPEAKER_00]: happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast does a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here on a Tuesday evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be hanging out with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be doing something with a pretty
lady and I'm recording a podcast because I
[SPEAKER_00]: love it and I love helping you guys and
these types of emails make it all worth
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this person is
treating their mental health with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're able to function with their
family and society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to help you in your
garden and get your problems dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am way happier and way more proud
that I am able to help you out with your
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health and improve your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that growing is one of the most
rewarding things you've done for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've achieved a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started growing and I was able to
produce quality cannabis for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to go buy it or seek it out
or search for it, that was such a great
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling of self-sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to provide this product for
myself without spending too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was able to grow it and start
spreading it out to people who were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to get my medicine into the
hands of people who were mentally and
[SPEAKER_00]: physically ill and were able to use
products that I grew to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and comfort level of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to consume a product that I
planted into dirt and nourished for 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14, 16 weeks, harvested it, dried it and
cured it, delivered it to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: hung out and smoked it with them and
watched them change.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time I got there, I rang the
doorbell and you got the, hold on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take me a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old and I don't fucking feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get to the door and they're like,
oh, it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grouchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sit down and you can tell on their
face, they're not feeling well and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed off that they had to answer the
door and someone's in their damn house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, I brought you this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been sick, but do you want
to try this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, they're starting
to get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, you grew some weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm gonna fucking smoke some weed with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you smoke it and you share it with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you watch their face go from angry to,
huh, this guy grew some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tasty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you watch their shoulders go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoulders start relaxing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you see them sit back in the chair a
little bit and the arms uncross and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legs uncross and they start relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start feeling better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms of their illness have kind of
subsided long enough for them to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're actually, I'm actually
hanging out with them and spending a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting to feel physically
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting to feel mentally better
and they're getting some social
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that feeling, trust me, I know the
feeling that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that growing was one of the
most rewarding things you've done for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to grow cannabis and then watch sick
people feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what you're talking about is the
short version of what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I ramble on for so long about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be a quickie,
but I know that feeling and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes on to say, thank you for
being kind enough to answer some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I didn't know what I was getting into
when I answered your first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was answering a grow
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've become friends and we're
talking about your mental health and how
[SPEAKER_00]: I've improved your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, thank you for sharing that with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to know that I'm
contributing to steady increase in mental
[SPEAKER_00]: health and happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in an Instagram feed told me that
I was an asset to our community and that
[SPEAKER_00]: meant a lot to me also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, with all the huge
compliments, it does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, to the dude that sent me this
email, I don't know if you want me to say
[SPEAKER_00]: your name again, since you revealed so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to improve your garden
and I am ecstatic that I'm able to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: your mental health and help you improve
your mental health and make your life with
[SPEAKER_00]: your family better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for being on Team Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having the balls to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for not being afraid and for
stepping outside of the box and for having
[SPEAKER_00]: faith in something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now share that story with more people
like you just did me so that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: more people to join Team Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna keep it quick, but I've got one
more email that I'm going to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, this one comes from a longtime
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is actually an old email that I
found in the archive folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to catch them all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're still listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, I've been a longtime listener
and had dreams of making it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved out to Cali and eventually landed
my first actual grow job working at newly
[SPEAKER_00]: started Medgrow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, my bosses are very new to
the game as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, it looks like they're
making some critical errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to get some solid facts and
feedback from a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, we're running
basic ocean forest soil mix with smart
[SPEAKER_00]: pots under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They currently have been feeding the
flower room every day with the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: mix every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, shouldn't there be a mix of some
fresh water only waterings too,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is this okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they are feeding every plant
every day, even if the soil is still moist
[SPEAKER_00]: from yesterday's feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any additional dangers to that
besides the chance of root rot from not
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the soil dry ever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for putting out all the info
and keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff to go on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliments at the end
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome for me putting out all the
info and I promise you to keep up all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the great work as long as I'm able.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into the email and answer a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time listener, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreams of making it into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've noticed some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bosses are new and they're fucking it
up and they're stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, no surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bosses are fucking stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every facility you go to, that's how it's
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get used to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say, you're running ocean forest
soil with smart pots under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're currently feeding the flower room
every day with the new mix every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your question is, shouldn't there be a
mix of some fresh water feedings or is
[SPEAKER_00]: this okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that since you're using
ocean forest soil, if you are feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients every day, you are going
to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are going to get salt buildups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are using nothing but organic teas
and non-bottled nutrients, that may work
[SPEAKER_00]: because the organics, hopefully they cycle
quickly enough and they're not overfeeding
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to where it won't burn the plants
and you won't get salt buildups,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's highly unlikely that's what
they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume they're just mixing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everything else you said,
I'm going to assume they're mixing up some
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients and you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to eventually cause,
it's going to be overnutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be over-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have too much salts in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is going to get off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start getting salt binding
to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to start locking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are going to start curling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to get dry and crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like a Cal Mag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an everything overfeeding
and the pH will get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be the first thing that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a fresh water feeding in
there probably every other time,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, just to clean out all
that salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go so hard with the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be feeding something gentle and
it may be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email is old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the date you sent me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how this worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this crop come out like shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this crop come out okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you done about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, but I want to keep reading
the email because we can still help
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, and I agree, there should be
some, if you're in cocoa, you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa does not hold onto nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa has a low cation exchange rate and
the nutrients fall right out of the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing binds into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil will hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start coming alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll colonize inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll create a little, it's called the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll create a little environment,
a little biosphere inside your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: inside your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's going to start going on in there if
you're feeding a bunch of stuff all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're putting in
there, but there's life happening and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually you'll get too much salt in
there and you'll destroy that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a lot of life, then you'll
destroy that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everything will lock out and you'll
get problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there should be a water feeding
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, they're also feeding
the plant every day, even if the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: moist from yesterday's feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let them dry out, especially in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get them almost scary dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in soil or soil-less mix and
you're in Fox Farms, so you can let them
[SPEAKER_00]: get really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll actually perform better if you let
them get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants go from really wet to really
dry, the pH changes drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the root zone and that makes more
nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different nutrients are available at
different pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to dial it into a certain range
where everything is available optimally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some things are better and more
available at higher and lower pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as things swing, it'll be able to get
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it likes that wet and dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis just really enjoys that wet and
dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the plants cycle better when
they get some time to dry down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watering the plant every day,
even if the soil is still moist is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not water it in the morning on day
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go all the way until the end of day
two, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's still wet when you come
in in the morning, wait till you leave
[SPEAKER_00]: before you're going to leave to water it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to water everything in the
morning just because that's the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the fucking boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, is there any additional dangers to
that besides the chance of root rot from
[SPEAKER_00]: not letting the soil dry ever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will slow your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will say, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's swampy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to grow in a swampy,
soggy mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my roots aren't going to grow as
quickly as they should and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get less harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get less production out of
the plants and you're going to have too
[SPEAKER_00]: much moisture in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that water in the soil is also
evaporating into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to increase humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to bring fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just asking for problems with that
much extra moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the shit dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots will grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them get to where you're almost
worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In soilless mix, it's best to get them to
where you're almost, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, these leaves are starting to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when the leaves start to droop,
water them then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email says bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for putting out all this info and
keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise I will keep up the good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that I'm doing episodes on
Monday and Thursday now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it quick.
