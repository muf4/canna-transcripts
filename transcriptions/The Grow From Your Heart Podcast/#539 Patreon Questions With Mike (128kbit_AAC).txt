[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining me on the mic today is our friend
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's having a good,
safe evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope quarantine is not getting to you
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are coming to you from a stormy and
rainy and thunderous night in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys hear weird noises in the
background, nobody fell down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no dump trucks driving through
the living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is thunder that you are hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much of that will come
through Mike's mic or my mic, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear noises, we are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody fell down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's time for episode 539 of the

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like to start this podcast
off by talking about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I just watched you take a couple of
dabs a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to have to call 911
and give them your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I may have to text your wife and
have her come check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just getting through the last of my
apothecary stash, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got just a little bit of sour diesel
ambrosia left.
[SPEAKER_02]: About to clean out the last of my stash of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm getting close to the shopping
time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to go to the dispensary
less and less during the COVID times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to go expose myself and put
the bud tenders at risk extra times,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they limit us on purchases here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can only buy so much on the rec
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only stock up so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the budget's only so fat,
so you can only do so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I try not to go at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time for me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always a sour diesel guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's diesel available, I'm sure
you'll take it.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a sucker for a good diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am over here smoking on something called
Lush Cherry Full Spectrum Extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of copper cam and cherry
kush mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on the jar is described as
leather, cherry, and gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never eaten leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure that it tastes or smells
like leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I'm fucking not even going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cowhide turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I'm over here rambling about
fucking leather turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really impressed me was this was a
four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this at a random dispensary in our
town, not a place I normally shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Hey, we got four gram jars of
the Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop by, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking diamonds in this jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have consumed most of this jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of chunky diamonds left
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diamonds in here were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, some teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the size of teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful ratio of turp sauce to
big diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presentation means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color, the texture, the smell,
a beautiful concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back, it does say 69.24% total THC
and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of that has just got to be turps
because it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt was here yesterday and I took a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I blew out the dab,
he wasn't even like watching, he was
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with his phone and I blew out the
dab and he goes, that smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was just what his face said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he just blurted it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells like, it sounded like Ralphie
just in the corner, Ralphie Wiggum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really autopilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty funny of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're smoking guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got some apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Green Dot, you know,
Colorado staples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike just leans in and said, big words for
the show, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to help, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of help, let's give some shout

[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, do you have anything you would like
to ramble about before we get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: listener emails?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I need a minute to get my face in
check.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say thank you to the people
that have hit up my Patreon and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: who's commented about the new video
format.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the feedback coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody likes the video shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like doing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're probably going to get some more
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the video shows are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like you being here, but the time that
you drive here, we get to just hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: and do a longer show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to drive here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to talk for an extra 40 minutes
instead of spending that minute in the car
[SPEAKER_02]: on the way home and on the way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then allegedly you don't have to drive
home after being here for two hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take that big, if you would have
taken that dab you just took at my house,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have been like, well, he's not leaving
for like fucking two and a half hours
[SPEAKER_02]: after that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to fucking make you a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been a minute and big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Mike said, big shout out to everybody
for all of the video feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be a lot more work now
that I've gotten a little more comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with the editing and I understand how to
do it and what my goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would just stop trying to make fancy
subtitles and intro screens and outro
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, the shit would take way less time,
but I'm getting good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you'll keep seeing video coming
from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm liking what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got more video guests lined up,
some more cool things in mind and planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a little bit of positive
coming out of this whole lockdown mess and
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff getting good at video editing is one
of them things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would not have happened without the
shout out to boredom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would not have had this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to quit talking about the
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is sick of hearing about that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to come listen to a
podcast and hear me talk about being
[SPEAKER_00]: locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear about positive energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come here and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get on that, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's growing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we can use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be another podcast catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to have a paintball
battle over this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody knows what's going on came from
what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: High five fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gang gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read a message that came from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from our friend Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much of their name they
want said, but it's from Tyler and Kay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't know how much of Kay's name
they want read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they say, Hey Ross, Jeff, we love your
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I caught a few minutes of your insta
the other night and you mentioned the
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming Jack the Ripper project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see what you come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you mentioned saving a few F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may have said F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all of you do from TNK
and then they even signed where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read your location,
but I didn't know that was, I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that was where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've corresponded a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that was where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my Instagram live feed, I was
talking about my current breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I'm looking for a Jack the Ripper
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I showed you those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look amazing under the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I found the male, which I want to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to pollinate a few select
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those females will also be a Jack
the Ripper females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can kind of make more of those
seeds in honor of my buddy, Subbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to kind of continue that genetic
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to breed with it as a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means I really trust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to hit a couple of my select
three select females are in the room to
[SPEAKER_00]: get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that on my Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out my Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm irey underscore genetics on Instagram
every Monday, approximately 17 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a show very similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take dabs, but there is no script.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are zero notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the people in the chat run the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They type in comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer their questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're not a dick, as long as
you're cool and you hang out, I'll try to
[SPEAKER_00]: reply to you and chat with you,
take some dabs and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a friendly vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that live chat, Tyler heard me
mention that I am breeding to the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper and Tyler is excited to get some of
the F1s and possibly even the F2s that
[SPEAKER_00]: come from that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I mentioned this idea on that live
chat, my phone started vibrating across
[SPEAKER_00]: the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to chase it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was a dog getting out of my
fucking control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're in the first round of seeds
are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't the nobody, maybe one of may
one or two of the Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings is kind of shown sex,
but that's all we've gotten so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need 70 days to flower them
approximately, you know, 60, 70,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75, depends on what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got to, that's just round one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the starter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's phase one round one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will grow out some of the
seeds and see if they were worth the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to even make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they were, then we'll send a
few of them out to some of our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this person here, since they've been
such a long time Patreon helper,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may let them be a tester of the first
batch, but they've got to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be taken from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be counted and put into a
little spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know how many seeds I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get, I'm going to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put up about a hundred of
them in a container and germinate them and
[SPEAKER_00]: count how many of them do not pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't get at least a solid
number, I won't even send them out to
[SPEAKER_00]: testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get a solid number, I'll grow a
bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testers will grow a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the testers show me they're reliable,
then we can think about putting them to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at, if we're going to
have a batch of seeds, we're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, I'm going to have to wait about a
week for them to start getting ready to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to have to wait about
a week for them to start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wait about a week,
70 days for them to flower from the day I
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into flower, which I don't expect
to do so for about 14 more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 84 days before they're even done 10
days to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: 94 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six days for me to fuck around because
sometimes I get thrown off schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hundred days before we can even
think about the first batch of seeds being
[SPEAKER_00]: touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Halloween now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one realizes how long this takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have the first batch of finished
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that lightning was so bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me blink indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that came up on the
camera, but that vibrated my whole chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have the first batch of seeds
flowered until around spring of 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valentine's day, March, April-ish of 2021
is when these first batch of seeds will be
[SPEAKER_00]: available for me to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a long ways off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I appreciate your enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not yelling at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not calling you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not shutting you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're first in line, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're first in line, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we'll put you on the
hypothetical waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you'll send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love you guys that get so
enthusiastic about stuff, but it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I don't reply to your request for
the Jack the Ripper crosses, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: so far they're thoughts and hopes and
dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you posting photos of this project
anywhere, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm posting good fucking cue,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good segue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do post pictures of the Jack
the Ripper progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my iRi genetics Instagram, it's iRi
underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that last photo you posted that was
sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That node spacing is just ridiculous,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is from, and that's another shameless
plug right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is from the Canon lighting from Black
Sail Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little test batch with some
cannons in there and those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, since you gave me a shameless plug
for my Instagram, you posted a really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: picture today that I think is flexing on
some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the folks how they can find
you on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Nemopunk15, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I tag him in some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the Grow From Your Heart podcast
Instagram, and sometimes I tag Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't Instagram very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I do, it's kind of poorly done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't Instagram well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your post today is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a nice bottle of ISO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to tell them what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he posted that, I was like,
my rig feels clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go to Walgreens to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom is a super shopper and showed up
over here with some rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, yeah, I know you buy a shit
ton of this and there's nowhere to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, you brought gold to my
house, lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the move I found, I must've gone
shopping and hit the Walmart and bought
[SPEAKER_02]: four bottles and I brought it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still in the fucking Walmart bag
and the Walmart bag had sat there long
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to have like tobacco stain on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would have been there for fucking
like eight months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right before the lockdown happens,
I find four bottles unopened 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a nice score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like toilet paper and bullets right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I love our random banter.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that it's like they're hanging
out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone's smoking a joint laughing
about our fucking toilet paper
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, buddy, you a my dog.
Hey buddy.
Hey buddy.
Hey buddy.
Hey buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just find their name in the
Youtube stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to the channel and I'm gonna use
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one, but it's actually too
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a good one because it goes on
to say, I'm dating him right now but he's
[SPEAKER_00]: not dating me on Instagram, but he's
dating me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to your channel and I'm gonna go
check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm gonna go to your channel and
I'm gonna click on the personal links.
[SPEAKER_00]: pack from SeedsHereNow.com and I wanted to
know what two strains of yours you would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to a rookie grower growing in
Coco Loco with new millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weight isn't what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for good turps and fire smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks in advance, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the good content coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I would be a bad host and a
bad friend if I did not remind you to use
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code GFYH10 while you're checking
out at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a small order, that at least
covers shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a large order, that adds up quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the strains that I would recommend,
he said for a beginner and a rookie grower
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in Coco, new millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weight is not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I read puts out the freaking
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most of my cuts come from commercial
grows and I understand you got to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for good turps and fire smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I recommend the same strains
all the time, but for a beginning grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want feminized seeds, I would
definitely recommend the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take very long to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody loves that citrus turp
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves that citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to that email, my first question
would be like, well, what turp are you
[SPEAKER_02]: into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want earthy, fruity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Point me in a direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And orangegasm is a nice sort of
wheelhouse one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That orange turp is just real smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buzz from it is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like good smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all day long cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke it all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke it right when you get up,
you're smiling and you're bouncing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke it right after lunch,
you're ready to go back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your job sucks, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smoke some orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a good fucking mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's evening time, want to chill out
and watch a movie, chill out, watch a
[SPEAKER_00]: movie, smoke some orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it before bed and I get the best
colorful cartoon, Simpsons-y looking
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend orangegasm to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a feminized strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get short flowering phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get eight and nine week flowering
phenotypes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't take super long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less time, the less opportunity to
fuck things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it smells and tastes and smokes
amazing, makes great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get good harvest, good smoke,
good turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an all-around champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to expand and do
something non-feminized, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: the prana or the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both really easy for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prana is super vigorous, really easy
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it doesn't take super long to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really unique, funky, hippie, stanky feet
kind of aromas, really unique flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people grow prana, they're always
like, wow, that was bright lightning.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people grow prana, they're always
like, what do you call these weird smells?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it smells like the Hindu shop on
Mass Street or on that big street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the name of the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Massachusetts, Newbury Street in Mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly what it smelled like when I
walked in there, feet and curry and
[SPEAKER_00]: incense and weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious, but that strain smells
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prana or the morning dew, the morning
dew is an SFOG, an SFOG, Chem 91 cross
[SPEAKER_00]: with some other stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through the rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty forgiving too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can beat the shit out of it and you'll
get good harvest and lots of gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy, berry kind of funky turps come out
of that one and good colors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to take photography,
that morning dew will give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome colors and so will the prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three great recommendations for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, anything from the turtles line,
any of the turtles will grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three bad guys don't grow as easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shredder grows really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop and Rocksteady are more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four TMNT crosses will grow like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similarly, to that orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that was a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not include their name and their
email, so I'm not going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the wonderful email and
let me know when you get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you selected and also
I want to see pictures of the grow as
[SPEAKER_00]: things progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing photos of my seedlings
turning into giant plants, into giant
[SPEAKER_00]: colas, and then you see them turn into
fucking concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep us updated folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to move to this other
message right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I kind of talked about this one
for a brief moment before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking to see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't read my own handwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message says, this one comes from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you'd like to help us out on
Patreon, it is patreon.com forward slash
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm doing some research about all
this stuff and I'm growing in a four pot
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculating deep water culture system,
which I built that goes on a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talks about deep water culture,
drilled the holes, keeping the water
[SPEAKER_00]: levels correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the part we need to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm using eight net pots and I
also have RO water, but I can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of RO and tap water if my tap
water is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically asking, they've got
access to RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got regular tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking basically it's a really
long message with a lot of, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: read to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were driving and typing,
but thanks for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got RO water and they've got tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking if they can mix the RO and
the tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, but that would be like cleaning
your water and then dumping it back in
[SPEAKER_00]: with dirty water and having kind of clean
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already did work and RO water,
you waste a lot of stuff and you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: filters and membranes and electricity and
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either do or don't would kind of be my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the reasoning for wanting to
do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely, if you've got RO
water, I'd use it or don't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO water can be a little bit more
challenging to buffer when it comes to pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the pH accurate is a little bit
more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there to keep it
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen more disconnected RO systems
than I've seen operational RO systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something I was going to add to
the sort of the end of that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be a dick about it, but that's just
my personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got good tap water,
the way to find out you've got good tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water is to run some tests on it,
run an EC test on there, run a PPM test on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the numbers are acceptable,
you've got good water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something seems higher than it should
be, maybe go to the local water company's
[SPEAKER_00]: website and see exactly what they're
adding into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a chart that shows what
they're putting in your local municipal
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can find out, do I need to work
on removing things?
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I know that I'm
generalizing, but in most places,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can drink the water without making
a funky face, it will probably be okay for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Flint, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say, what about Flint?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, if you can drink it without making
a funky face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your tap water is good, use the tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, in most
cases, I do not use RO because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: harder for the crew to adjust the pH once
we mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use a big boy filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big boy filter takes out most of the
stuff that I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not nearly as much waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend mixing the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to clean water and then pour
it back in with the not clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get either semi-clean or
semi-dirty water, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: optimistic or pessimistic you are at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely one or the other, if you ask me
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talked about this email
originally, that question struck me as
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we addressed that one here at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, pick one, one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless your water is bad, I don't see a
reason to use the RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is good, use that tap water
unless you really want to be super in
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fun to see exactly what you're
putting in there, but it is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, are all your pots connected?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got a four pot connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all connected together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do any experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do side by sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will be fine without the RO to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small boy or a big boy,
that would be ideal, but don't mix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say don't mix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one, pick the other, go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what your approach is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to send me another message,
letting me know what your intent is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know why you thought about using
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could go a little further and
give you a little bit better advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if necessary, I can call a friend
who's more of a water expert, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see what they're thinking at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far with the information I've got,
we've taken a vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one, stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do a phone a friend question with
the Zoom shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we sure could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I could just call them before the show
or I could Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the information we've got,
Mike, I think we've gone as far as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next rabbit hole is to start
wrapping up this episode, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for close to 30 minutes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we get done doing these
outros, we'll be hitting the 30 minute
[SPEAKER_00]: mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any words of wisdom for the
final portion of the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just smoke a joint and smile a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is starting to get warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to dig out the shorts for these
bucking tall white legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that I want to punish the
world with these pasty summer legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the shorts out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lockdown, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to expose the crew of work
to those pasty legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just your sad ass backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't want to talk too much about
the quarantine, but I am excited for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: get over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to get out there and get some
sunshine, go see some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go sit at the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three people at the park and we
can see each other like, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're not trying to talk about the
quarantine at all, but my next door
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor tonight had one of those drive by
and everybody honk birthday things.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the one hand, bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids were like, why is everybody
honking?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to go watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went out front.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing that struck me because
there were six cars in a row that had the
[SPEAKER_02]: worst possible age for teenagers in the
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two or three of them,
12, 13, 14, 15, the real fucking asshole
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the kids were off their phones,
into it, waving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first it struck me as it ought to just
look weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's wrong about this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find what's missing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was like, oh man, all these
teenagers are really into something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of cheesy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, we've been locked down a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is so starved for slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey kids, do you want to go get the car
and drive by someone's house and wave for
[SPEAKER_02]: his birthday?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go drive six blocks and wave at
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our level of excitement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brave new world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the new birthday party,
drive by and honk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just throw an Amazon gift card at you
as I drive by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were collecting the big poster board
signs that they were driving by and
[SPEAKER_02]: waving.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is birthdays with Mike and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthdays in the time of COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you stole my line, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say I want to thank
everybody for hanging out, checking out
[SPEAKER_00]: two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a really fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some news out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some emails answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some Patreon questions resolved and
we had a good ass time.

depending on how long it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do my best to get to the Patreon
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more here in front of me that
I've got to save for another episode
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want to put a little bit of time
and effort into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to speed through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to get your questions
