[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world,
I'm your host Rasta Jeff this is episode
[SPEAKER_01]: 880 of the grow from your heart podcast
You know, I've got another fun episode
[SPEAKER_01]: lined up for us in today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give away free seeds hang out
We'll talk more about those free seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: later on in today's show before we get too
far I do want to remind you that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: a tax day sale happening and I read direct
comm that's right Make sure you check I
[SPEAKER_01]: read direct comm for restocks and Possibly
a fresh drop of new testers I read direct
[SPEAKER_01]: comm also all orders over $100 do come
with free shipping and I read direct comm
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I do want to invite you to join us
at the dude grows cup That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude grows cup is quickly approaching
the iry army will be there I will be there
[SPEAKER_01]: white Mike will be there the dude from the
dude grows show will be there Scotty real
[SPEAKER_01]: will be there for all of the info Make
sure you check DG C cup comm for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: links and details And of course how to get
your tickets the event is quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching make sure you get all of your
accommodations Set up for that event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that is all of the advertising
here at the start of the show Let's work
[SPEAKER_01]: our way into the question and answer
portion of today's podcast at the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the show I said I was going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you win free seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very easy I have a website that
website is I read genetics comm on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of that website There's a row of tabs one
of those tabs does say grow help or grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions if you click on that tab,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me a grow question If I read
your question here on the podcast I will
[SPEAKER_01]: send you a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds off of iry direct comm Today's first
[SPEAKER_01]: question came from the grow help tab on
iry genetics comm This question came from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who wants to be called JP big
shout out to my new friend JP Hey JP,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds Also, make sure you check your
spam Because a lot of times your server
[SPEAKER_01]: makes I thinks that my email is spam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a ding-dong Alright, the question goes
a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says thanks for dropping all of the
knowledge about feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: reversals lately I'm glad you guys noticed
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make a lot of fem seeds I feel like I've
understood fem seeds and gotten it figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great to share that with you
There's a lot of myths and misconceptions
[SPEAKER_01]: that come along with fem seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to Speak knowledgeably about
that subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have a question about choosing a
female for a reversal So what this
[SPEAKER_01]: listener wants to do is take a female
plant and they want to reverse it What
[SPEAKER_01]: that means is treat it with the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great products out
there You can make your own silver
[SPEAKER_01]: thiosulphate or there are a few ready-made
products already sold that you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them work some of them I have not
tried but they want to treat this female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant with a product and put That will
make this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a female plant They want to treat it
that will make this female plant create
[SPEAKER_01]: anthers that contain female pollen Then
they will put that female pollen on
[SPEAKER_01]: another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read about and see what they want to
do with that I have a question about
[SPEAKER_01]: choosing a female for reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got a female They want to know
how to choose a female that they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: spray From effects to structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably a dozen traits to
consider There are like 65 traits that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can think of off the top of my head to
consider What are the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: traits to consider when making the choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the most important traits to
consider when selecting a female candidate
[SPEAKER_01]: for reversal?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very great question Then it goes
on it says perhaps you have two female
[SPEAKER_01]: keepers From half sibling crosses one
foxtails and the other has spear top and
[SPEAKER_01]: dense colas Everything else aside which
one flower structure would be better
[SPEAKER_01]: suited for male flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so There is a lot to go on in
this answer The main answer is um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote the plant will tell you are no the
plant you like The best or the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like your goal is the plant to use
then I said the plant will tell you what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do So this person said they've got two
sibling plants two half siblings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one did they choose?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to reverse one and then what are
you gonna do with that pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you gonna put it on a lot of things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you gonna put it on itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you gonna put it on that other plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is its sibling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to know what you're gonna
Do from there, but you want to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: to select for?
[SPEAKER_01]: This candidate for reversal in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about what is your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to make tall skinny plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to make short stout plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to make plants to grow wide
and bushy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to make plants without a giant
apical top or something with the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: top and more equally sized bottoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does what grows best in your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What smokes best in your bong?
[SPEAKER_01]: What sells best in your circle?
[SPEAKER_01]: What works best for your medical
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: What suits your needs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I like I like tall skinny plants
to take like 77 days and make a giant top
[SPEAKER_01]: cola and can be trellised out And I like
specific shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe perhaps you grow in a way different
environment I'm sure that your brain
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry and body chemistry are not a
hundred percent the same as mine So we
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy smoking similar yet different things
so I can give you advice on this But it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all about what do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want your your offspring to
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want them to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want them to smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of buzz do you want them?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of medical effect do you want
them to carry?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of this to consider The
beautiful part about using female plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're reversing is we can smoke these
plants and we know exactly what this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: does So we know what it's gonna bring to
the mix These aren't my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going way off of my notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of think of breeding is like
cheffing If you put chocolate and
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry together, you're hoping to get
chocolate and strawberry But if you pour a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of vinegar in there that
vinegar is gonna Overpower if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a chocolate flavored outcome You got
to put chocolate flavored products into
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you put garlic and eggs into your
chocolate thing It's not gonna have the
[SPEAKER_01]: right flavor in the end if you want to
make a savory dish use your garlic That's
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of that's where and breeding I think
works the same way So what you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out is what you put in?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said one of the plants has air your
buds and one has more dense buds What do
[SPEAKER_01]: you want and don't worry about the
reversal what it's gonna look like what
[SPEAKER_01]: would be better for reversal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's worry about what's gonna be better
as offspring for breeding because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: both gonna reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should both reverse There's rare
cases where shit doesn't reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're both going to work
especially for like a personal breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project You're gonna get productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna make seeds So you said one
makes foxtails foxtails one has a spear
[SPEAKER_01]: top and dense colas, which one do you like
better?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing for flower a lot of
people will prefer a nice dense cola a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time ago Dr. Dre wrapped that rocks
and hard buds were the way to go and now
[SPEAKER_01]: we all believe that but if you're making
Concentrates if you're a hash maker and
[SPEAKER_01]: air your bud a fluffier bud is easier to
work with there's more surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if I dunked my fist in powdered
sugar I get this much powdered sugar on
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside if I open my hand and moisten
my hand and dunk that in the powdered
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar I get all the area between my
fingers and in my palm I get that much
[SPEAKER_01]: more surface area for tricholm that's
easier to wash and blast off if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which one do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're asking me for my guidance in
my advice, but my advice is grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart and breed with love grow these
plants and see And then you'll know you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just gonna know in my opinion You won't
know a breeder knows an artist knows a
[SPEAKER_01]: musician knows, you know what note goes
there You know what color goes there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know which plant to use and if you
can't decide what's to stop you from using
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god, not even gonna edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me If you're not gonna if you
what's to stop you from reversing both of
[SPEAKER_01]: them not at the same time Of course,
but run a crop reverse this one use the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen clean up start over reverse the
other one do it again Then grow a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is to stop you now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be doing you any service I
didn't give you some actual shit to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually go over and actually look for to
select from What some traits to consider?
[SPEAKER_01]: Structure and shape are probably the first
visual things you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that plant shaped?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the structure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before is it tall is it skinny
is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wide is it stout?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are the branches can it hold itself
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shape and structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of frame does this plant have?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna tell you a lot about the
plant Anyway, how the buzz is gonna be the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time You can tell that by
looking at that shape and structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf shape of that plant Then the overall
vigor does the plant grow super slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it grow really quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it take off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it fucking wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it go every which direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a shape and structure then I'm
gonna think about how quickly it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then does it handle my room and my style?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the most amazing plant on the
planet But if it doesn't work in my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: environment if it doesn't get with my
program, it's got a fucking go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work That's just how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes sometimes I'll find a plant that
is good But it doesn't fit my style my
[SPEAKER_01]: room and I'll breed it to something that
really suits my grow to try to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring more suited to my style,
but if a plant doesn't work in My grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got a fucking go dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does it handle my style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we get along?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like dating a girl if she doesn't
like riding around in my car and being in
[SPEAKER_01]: my house We obviously aren't gonna fucking
work out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If she wants to be at a different
environment than me all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are the same way Then I wrote
down smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are the turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the buzz?
[SPEAKER_01]: The buzz to me is what matters,
you know, it doesn't matter what it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like how it grows in the end We're gonna
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what really fucking matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do people do I want to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to consume this product is the
most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one that you want to smoke choose
that one Um, it's got to fit my agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote what is the goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I making hash plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I making?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I doing it for sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want fast flowering long flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific turp or a specific
trait or a specific metal medical benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I'm after so many of these things
would play into my breeding and then also
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are going outdoors or if you're in
a Room that gets powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe think about plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the traits would be the plants that
Show the least powdery mildew if you put
[SPEAKER_01]: ten plant this is just hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your environment We could do
other stressors as well If you've got any
[SPEAKER_01]: stressor you got ten plants the one that
is most resistant to the stress in your
[SPEAKER_01]: room drought heat humidity powdery mildew
spider mites Whatever appears in your room
[SPEAKER_01]: that one plant that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't get that breathe to that
fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna continue that trait Hopefully
the offspring have that trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said do both now I gave you a list of
things that I would choose from structure
[SPEAKER_01]: shape vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to handle my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to smoke Well, it's got to smell
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to fit my agenda It's got to be
the kind of plants that I want to make And
[SPEAKER_01]: then why not do both of them and also
let's think about we said resistance I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we covered most of the things the
traits that I would think about so part of
[SPEAKER_01]: your question was which one would be best
suited For male flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't stress too much about the best
suited for male flower best pollen donor
[SPEAKER_01]: with the best traits is what I would more
focus on and depending on how a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to depend on the dominance
and Codominance of the genes of these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Well, then the recessive traits and the
dominant traits when you throw these so
[SPEAKER_01]: think about you have just a bunch of red
marbles and a bunch of blue marbles one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant makes red marbles one plant makes
blue marbles and You're going to throw
[SPEAKER_01]: them into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to shake them and then you're
going to scoop them up Whatever comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: that scoop is the traits that come with
that plant I should get the camera down
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever colors are in that little scoop
are the traits that come in that plant So
[SPEAKER_01]: all the traits from the mom plant and the
dad plant or the pollen donor in this case
[SPEAKER_01]: is still the dad plant All those traits
have been thrown into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are recessive Some of them
are codominant some traits from mom the
[SPEAKER_01]: mom plants mom plants Will pop up into
this mix and some plants from the dad on
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides mom and dad on both sides A
couple of those marbles got thrown into
[SPEAKER_01]: this mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the purple marbles Hopefully you
can identify them when you grow it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all that shit ended up in your scoop
It depends on how the genes of these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants interact on what you're gonna get
sometimes You get exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what you're gonna create by
looking you like I got red here I got blue
[SPEAKER_01]: here when I mix these it should come out
purple right there That's what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: hope for as a breeder Sometimes you're
gonna see this plant leans more red or it
[SPEAKER_01]: leans more blue or it's really purple But
sometimes you're gonna get an orange
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna go what the fuck happened
here That's just the way the genetics can
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes Sometimes you get a bunch of
blue plants and then a couple of purple
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out of the mix That's just the way
the genetics can mix so selection is fun
[SPEAKER_01]: selection is great But you're gonna have
to realize also that that the genes are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's Recap here because I've been
talking for a long time on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure I answer your question
I gave you my theory that the plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you like just by looking at them
something in one will go I'm the one you
[SPEAKER_01]: should reverse and listen to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not crazy That's intuition and
that's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to your gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will tell you um a Question about
choosing a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I got it from effective structure
probably half a dozen I think I gave you
[SPEAKER_01]: half a dozen traits to think about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Everything else aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would get away from the Notion
about which one is the best male flower
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea Unless you're making
thousands of seeds for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not gonna matter Both plants should
make you a decent amount of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should make femme seeds from that Pick
the one that you like the best the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that you enjoyed the best that looks like
the goal is the one that I would reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I would pollinate the other one
and a clone of the one you reversed as
[SPEAKER_01]: well and do other plants as well while
you're at it put a few other in that room
[SPEAKER_01]: just hit them and then run all of those
seeds And see what you've made if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been listening to the podcast you
understand why I want to see if you take
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate and you put it on lemon
strawberry banana and grape I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: forget all those but I want to see what
the outcome is because if they all come
[SPEAKER_01]: out with the chocolate turp We know that's
coming from the chocolate plant But if
[SPEAKER_01]: only one or two of them If one plant has a
certain trait that could have came from
[SPEAKER_01]: the mother plant in the breeding We want
to find the commonalities that that dude
[SPEAKER_01]: is adding to the mix if they all come out
with fucking if they all glow in the dark
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from The male any trait that all
of the progeny has came from the male any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the other shit that seems rare in the
crosses That you can't identify from other
[SPEAKER_01]: batches as what the female is providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'd say hit a bunch
Structure vigor handles my shit smokes
[SPEAKER_01]: good fits my agenda And then what's to
stop you from doing it both ways my dude
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me rambling pretty good on this
podcast Make sure you check your inbox for
[SPEAKER_01]: your free seeds and once again make sure
to check that spam ladies and gentlemen
[SPEAKER_01]: boys and girls if you like These are
non-stop ramblings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a good time to hit like and
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and mash that like button click
subscribe It's free and then that way you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't miss any of this amazing cannabis
cultivation Content.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another page here This one also
came from the grow help tab on I read
[SPEAKER_01]: direct die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics comm two different
websites I redirect for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics for all of the other stuff
This one came from a friend who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: be called bum clot Welcome to the party,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the question says weird question about
seeds that I just don't understand this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a good question because This tales right
off of the last question that we just
[SPEAKER_01]: asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it says I have a plant that's
growing small towers of calyxes and
[SPEAKER_01]: foxtails and the other four are growing
and their own special ways, but My
[SPEAKER_01]: question is and a little drum roll
happened in my head just now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Little drum roll going on Anyways,
it says is every pack of feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: going to produce a wide range of
phenotypes It's a really good question and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't explain this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't answer if yes or no, but I have
some input Then what's the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: listing strain information if you plant
five seeds and all of them have different
[SPEAKER_01]: morphology smell and other traits that
makes sense I get your frustration It says
[SPEAKER_01]: is this just something that happens with
big seed companies versus smaller guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shouldn't be an issue This is just a
breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to determine if this is
The case with all seeds or just lazy
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a lot of times I would
call out a lazy breeding technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not lazy breeding This is how
feminized seeds work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave my analogy of pouring So you've got
plant A and plant B.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got colored marbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill a bucket with the colored marbles
You mix them you take a scoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what you made genetically with
those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Femseeds are usually first filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the first Time that they are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the first cross which means there is
no Stabilization happening in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word stabilization is used incorrectly
a lot of the times it can be used for
[SPEAKER_01]: sexual stabilization, but most of the time
when we say stabilization what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about is Phenotypical
stabilization across homa got homo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even try to say it now We want
uniform looking plants across the
[SPEAKER_01]: population homozygous is the word that my
brain would not spit out there We want
[SPEAKER_01]: them to all look the same So that would
take you two three four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: Generations of breeding to get that plant
to to look homozygous all of the same But
[SPEAKER_01]: with fem seeds most of these are s ones or
our ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just having a conversation with this
I wanted to explain it but I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: save it here for the podcast Most of these
are s ones or our ones and s1 is if I take
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant I take two copies of it and I
self it I take that pollen from the golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat put the pollen on the golden goat I
have self that golden goats a golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: Itself nobody else if I pay put the golden
goat pollen on any other plant that is an
[SPEAKER_01]: r1 that is a reversal So that's the
difference between an s and an r the self
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff You're going to find more uniformity
because we're not adding as many
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients It is all golden goat golden
goat to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should get golden goat, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The magic part about breeding the magic
part about genetics is you're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: so golden goats obviously got parents We
started with two golden goat plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that plant Had parents it had island
sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa Romulan and
[SPEAKER_01]: its background and those plants have
parents as well So all of those genes are
[SPEAKER_01]: all in this mix Which means when you run
the golden goat to golden goat You could
[SPEAKER_01]: see some island sweet skunk Hawaiian
sativa Romulan phenotypes pop out Those
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be the outliers most of your
phenotypes will look like golden goat But
[SPEAKER_01]: some are going to represent the mom the
dad the grandma the grandpa those will pop
[SPEAKER_01]: through from both sides That's just the
way it's gonna work with self seeds with
[SPEAKER_01]: the s ones now with the Rs We're taking
two different plants and we're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the opportunity to see
representations We hope as a breeder to
[SPEAKER_01]: get I usually hope for a 50-50 mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I throw I'm gonna do the marbles
analogy again if I throw 50% 64 red
[SPEAKER_01]: marbles and 64 blue marbles wouldn't mix
them up when I make my scoop I'm hoping to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a bunch of purple marbles,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 purple marbles out of that is what I
would hope for But it's not gonna work
[SPEAKER_01]: that way because sometimes I'm gonna get
marbles that like I said before to lean a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more red There's gonna be
marbles that lean a little bit more blue
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it's gonna go because this
is the first filial generation of this
[SPEAKER_01]: cross Even though it is an r1,
even though it may be an s1 It is also an
[SPEAKER_01]: f1 which means it's got that f1 vigor But
it's also got that hybridization where it
[SPEAKER_01]: could show filial our phenotypes and
phenotypes Phenotypical expression
[SPEAKER_01]: expression said expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even gonna edit that phenotypical
expression from both sides And from
[SPEAKER_01]: further generations it can show you a lot
of those expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you're seeing differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it lazy breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: No It is that's what when we're making f1s
s1s r1s That's how it works because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no we haven't done any
stabilization work to make them more
[SPEAKER_01]: uniform that would take another generation
two more Generations to make them uniform
[SPEAKER_01]: and stable f1 seeds work the same way if
you buy a bunch of f1s from people I sell
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of f1s and many people enjoy that f1
because it has a lot of vigor and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: find the phenotype that they like You're
gonna find the phenotypes you like So you
[SPEAKER_01]: say why make a strain description because
we've narrowed it down that it is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: close to that You're gonna get within this
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't be perfectly accurate with it,
but we get pretty close You'll notice my
[SPEAKER_01]: descriptions are pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those are f1s and I'm still
nailing It I've often described it like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you've decided you want Italian food
So you go to a website you find seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe look like Italian food be creative
with me here You found your favorite you
[SPEAKER_01]: found a plant that says tastes like
strawberries and bananas and when you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it It makes your fucking hair fly
backward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, that's exactly what the fuck
I want, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go to the restaurant The drive that
fucking tastes like strawberries and
[SPEAKER_01]: bananas makes your hair fly backward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the right restaurant We've given
you the menu now the the phenotypical
[SPEAKER_01]: expression the variation you may get In my
opinion, that's like once you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: menu I can go over and decide if I want no
key if I want fucking penne pasta if I
[SPEAKER_01]: want spaghetti If I want some meat sauce
You get that's so I've driven you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurant now You just got to choose the
one on the menu that works best for you
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's where we go back to
choosing the one that works best for your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow your bong your customers your wallet
Whatever you're growing for we got to find
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that works best for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a weird question I understand
where you're coming from when we put it On
[SPEAKER_01]: a pack of seeds you want it to come out
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind these are nat nature's
fucking little beans that it's nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is genetics There's going to be
variation just like if your mom and dad
[SPEAKER_01]: made 20 babies They're not all gonna look
the same if your mom's got blue eyes Your
[SPEAKER_01]: dad's got brown eyes some of theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that one of those dominant is
dominant in the breeding I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: researched which is dominant blue or brown
eyes, but some of your siblings are gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have brown eyes some are gonna have blue
eyes and maybe One or two of them may have
[SPEAKER_01]: green eyes because grandma or grandpa
somewhere in the line had green eyes It's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna work that way Maybe one of your
brothers and sisters is super fucking tall
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other guys are five eight Just a
phenotypical outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way genetics work We wish we
could control it and manipulate it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking I put Paul in here I put Paul in
here and tada these are all gonna come out
[SPEAKER_01]: like clones That is not the way that
genetics work that it takes a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not lazy breeding It's just when so
with fem seeds the first filling
[SPEAKER_01]: Generations of femmes and my experience
are the best after that you start
[SPEAKER_01]: unlocking weird shit You can make weird
plants mutants things that don't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So s ones are the best f1r ones are the
best for the for the fems because Like
[SPEAKER_01]: when you breed with an f2 a normal f2 reg
seed That's when you unlock Pandora's box
[SPEAKER_01]: of phenotypes that s2 is where a lot of
weird shit also happens So that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing it that way my dude Um,
what's your name bum clot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it, bro Make sure you check your
inbox and thank you for the great question
