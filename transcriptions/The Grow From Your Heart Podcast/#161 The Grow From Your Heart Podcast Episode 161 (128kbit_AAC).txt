[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 161 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Halloween, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this episode comes out on
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're all dressed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're having a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a cool ass costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a picture of yourself in your
Halloween costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what you wore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what you look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Halloween costumes,
I want to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Heady Halloween party
sponsored by our friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at, where was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at the Black Sheep in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I had to turn that music down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not even focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really loud in my brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heady Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Becca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heady Halloween was the Halloween party
thrown by our friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They threw the party at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple few bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had booths there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had live glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a costume contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I won first place in a costume
contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a Chewbacca costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it at a costume shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took them a long time to get it in
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took like three weeks to order that
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the cheapest costume anybody's
ever bought, but it was well worth it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think I've had it for four or
five years and I wear it every other year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year I win at least one costume
contest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is paid for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Elevate party, I won a dope new
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Halloween themed rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brighter orange than normal orange,
but it's like orange, a little brighter
[SPEAKER_01]: than orange crayon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a pumpkin on the back of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a straight tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, I don't know, it's probably,
it's almost the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same height as my Dr. Pepper
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost the height of a water bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a straight tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a round ball pumpkin looking base
and then it's got a straight tube and then
[SPEAKER_01]: another orange, kind of a pumpkin looking
spot and then a straight piece and then
[SPEAKER_01]: another pumpkin looking orange bulb with a
green top on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks pumpkin-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a 14 millimeter banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a 14 millimeter banger on it that
came from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also got a carb cap on here that
came from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I know it sounds like a fix that
I won the costume contest, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people from Elevate did not decide
that I won.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crowd decided that I won the costume
contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could not be a fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was based on crowd applause and it was
clear that they liked my costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to everybody that was at
the costume contest that voted for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big congratulations to Becca.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a little nervous about her party.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was messaging me throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, are you coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's a good turnout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the middle of the night,
we realized that she sold that place out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on selling the place out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Matt Z who made the rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I gotta mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna wrap up the shout outs here
and get to the topic of the show in just a
[SPEAKER_01]: second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give a huge shout out again to
Becca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge shout out to Dab and Granny for
hanging out with me at the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of fun with Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking pictures and I'm always the
tall guy and the tallest guy in the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wearing that Chewbacca costume,
which makes me another, I'm 6'5 already,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably 7'2 on the Chewbacca costume
because the mask is real, real tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes me a little taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking pictures and Granny's a tall
lady, but we're taking some pictures and
[SPEAKER_01]: she was right in front of me and she had
to bend over to do a pose or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they told me to squat down
because I'm too tall and they couldn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: my head in the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Granny and I were kind of hanging out a
little close there and she made some jokes
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny is such a hilarious lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really funny hanging out with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, no matter how old you are,
she can fucking keep up with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She can smoke more dope than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny's a rad lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her Halloween costume was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a cannabis nun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stuttered when I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a cannabis nun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant to say, cannabis nun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she wore a nun outfit that had ganja
leaves hanging off of it and she had cool
[SPEAKER_01]: ganja sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: She changed her sunglasses three or four
times throughout the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, or I might've been real high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it was hard to see shit through
that Chewbacca costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Lindsay and Chris,
Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, oh shit, the Citrus Drop chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know that soda commercial with
the awkward ginger girl and she wears the
[SPEAKER_01]: tank top with her soda on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lemon lime soda and some short
shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were both that, so it was silly cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Fox.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hung out with me a little bit at the
Halloween party.
[SPEAKER_01]: His costume, he looked like a,
it was hard to tell, he had horns and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, he looked like a Viking sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also Logan and Cody hung out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Lydia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Abigail looked adorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kinsey looked adorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm just going to rattle on a
bunch of names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to everyone at freaking
the Heady Halloween party.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we do that again next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into the main topic of the
show, but there's one more thing I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about before I get into the main
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just noticed something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a new mic cover on this microphone,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to replace the microphone covers
on these mics so that not everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: spitting into the same thing and rubbing
their face on the same shit for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just gave myself a fresh new one and
it stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like shoe polish or something
funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason I keep sniffing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, what do I have to do next?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give a shout out to my friends
at The Daily Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a lot of people have been asking
me, of course I am iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed, I bred the grateful dog,
the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm pretty much known for the
Arise is what's been going on this real
[SPEAKER_01]: popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made Arise F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Cascade available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I am iRegenetics and a lot of
people know that and they ask me for
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are local in Colorado and you can
find me, maybe we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I cannot ship seeds to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my friends at the Dankteam,

[SPEAKER_01]: I fully endorse TheDankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, let's get into the main
topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing I wanna talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a forum the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do read the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I troll around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not use a name that anybody would
recognize me by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't find me on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also in a bunch of Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've had to check out of a bunch of
the Facebook groups because honestly I see
[SPEAKER_01]: so...
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I was taking some fat dabs with
some live resonant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got me all clogged up,
but we'll deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get through a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll quit right about the time the show
ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a bunch of bullshit in Facebook
groups, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people recommending the shittiest
advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go look at the person that gave
that advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at their pictures of their grow and
I can see why their grow looks the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: does and why they're giving the advice
that they're giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not qualified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of frustrates me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to leave a bunch of Facebook
groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do go troll around and browse around
the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lately a topic I've seen more than
once or twice is people were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to determine flowering times of new
seeds and new clones that they've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: that they don't have any information on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody got some bag seed and they
don't know how long to let that bag seed
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe somebody was gifted a clone and
they don't know anything about the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: from the friend they gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were like, hey Rasta Jeff,
how do I determine how long to let these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants flower so that I don't fuck up my
crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, I'm gonna get some water here
and fix up my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I'm gonna take a couple more
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we're gonna talk
about how to determine flowering time of
[SPEAKER_01]: new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promised we would talk about ways to
determine flowering time of new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you got some seeds and you don't
know how long those seeds are supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you had a bunch of packs of seeds
and these got mixed up or mislabeled or
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't labeled at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe they came out of a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got seeds that you're running
and you have no idea what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need to know how long to let
those plants flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your buddy gave you clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you bought clones at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you cut clones and you don't know
which clone that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to determine how long to let that
plant flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously the easiest way to do that
would to be flower that plant out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: around week seven or eight, maybe eight or
nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say about week seven, get in there
and start looking at that plant with a
[SPEAKER_01]: loop or a magnifier of some sort of a
magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of an eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need at least a 60 to 100 times
magnifying glass to look at these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna see the trichomes that are on
your buds and look in a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: places on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just look in one spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I use hooks up to my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a, let me see, I can go right
here on my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll remind me the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Dinoscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a Dinoscope little, it's a scope
that hooks up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a magnifying scope that hooks up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a USB port.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes right into my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works with a Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works with a Windows machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it on a Mac, so I promise it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bitch to get it started,
but once I downloaded the driver and got
[SPEAKER_01]: it working, it works beautifully every
time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take screenshots of what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this little scope, I basically,
I can take, I take my chair cause it rolls
[SPEAKER_01]: and has wheels and I put the MacBook on
the chair because I'm clumsy and I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: drop shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I leave the MacBook on the chair and I
roll it around and then I use the scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice long cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I use that scope to go find the
spots that I want on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I look at the screen and I can
see if the trichomes are amber or if the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes are clear or if they're milky or
if they're busted, ruptured open and got
[SPEAKER_01]: shit dripping out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the scope I've got, I can see bug
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is bug shit in my plants,
I can see any insect in the world with
[SPEAKER_01]: this scope that I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to pull a leaf off randomly and
look at the underside of the leaf and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for eggs, looks for bugs,
look for bug shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for signs of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you need, if you can't get that
type of a thing for your computer,
[SPEAKER_01]: they sell, the 420 scope is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they call it the dope scope or the
420 scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one sold at the grow store that is
made by Hydrofarm, which is the one that I
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the 100X little scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a AA battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It folds, it may take two batteries,
but it folds, folds together real nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you unfold it, it lights up and
then you can see through it real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one I really like, but get yourself a
scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can look at the trichomes,
at least 60X, 100X magnification is
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most obvious way to tell when
plants are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: When within your view, you're probably
going to see a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hard to count them,
but you want about 25 to 30% of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 to 30% of those, you want them turning
amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to kind of look like the
color, like maybe you dipped them in Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepper, or maybe they got a little,
they're just, you could see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns the amber orangish color.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start off clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll get milky and then they get
like a silvery color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from silver, that's when they
start turning amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when 30% of your trichomes are amber,
that's usually when you want to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: most strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go a little early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go a little late.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that huge of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people way overstressed the
harvest window.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a production facility, we say this
strain gets this many days and then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting it the fuck down because we have
another crop coming up right behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the weed comes out pretty fabulous
in most of the production facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just pick something like 60 days or
70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say 63 days because that's nine
full weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the strains we're running
nowadays, nine weeks is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk a little more because this
scope, the looking at the trichomes is
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to help you out, but you're
going to need to know a little earlier in
[SPEAKER_01]: the game when to harvest because you're
going to need to flush your plants about
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 14 days before you start cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heavily stress flushing your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free and you've got to water the
plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not just pour a bunch of water in
there and clean the plants out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about some ways to determine
how long those plants are going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to figure out how indica or
sativa dominant those plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a huge indicator of that is leaf shape
and size.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your leaf has really long slender
fingers, it's probably sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to lead more toward the
nine to 10 week range, maybe even longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants have big fat broad leaves,
if they're real wide, if the wider the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, probably the shorter the flowering
period is something that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not always true, but it's usually a
good thing to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got good wide leaves,
you're looking at eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you've got a eight or nine week
plant, the first time you run it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend going nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not try that extra week to see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get more bulk right at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get more resin right at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may harden up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may do a lot of good shit in that last
one week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to over ripen too much,
but don't worry about a little over
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that huge of a game, especially
if it's your first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I wrote down that I
wanted to wait a little while to mention,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is hopefully not your last time
running this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your first time running this
strain, which means you can fuck it up
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have another time and another
time and another time after that to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully if this is a good genetic,
a good cultivar, and you can keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: around, you're going to be running it a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just your test run.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your first date.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leaf size and leaf shape will give you
a big hint on how long those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got an eight or nine week plant,
like I just said, like the eight or nine
[SPEAKER_01]: week indica, let it go nine weeks because
you want it to go to full maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant with long skinny
leaves, that's a nine to 10 week plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend letting that plant go 10
weeks the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see what the potential of that
plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those sativa plants really do
magical shit toward the end of their
[SPEAKER_01]: growth phase or the end of their flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bulk up, they resin up, they really
put on some flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get better at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably swelling up because they
want to be bred to and you're not giving
[SPEAKER_01]: them any pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just getting bigger and bigger
and stickier and fatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's better to let those
sativa strains go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like an 11 week sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't scare me to run a 77 day sativa
dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower it when it's real short,
be ready to have some sticks and some
[SPEAKER_01]: warts available and get that sucker going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to grow something that
takes 77 days or even maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get more potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You usually get more weight and everybody
loves that good sativa buzz and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's growing those shorter indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing a heady sativa,
you're going to stand out from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical users are going to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational users are going to love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to help everybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basic leaf size is a good indicator
of how long your strain may take from the
[SPEAKER_01]: very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's real broad, you're looking at
eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got some skinny leaves,
go nine or 10 weeks, maybe even a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is if you start flushing a
little bit too early, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start flushing too late,
that's when you start overdoing things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got these plants that are
going to end up taking 13 or 14 weeks and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've already started flushing to be
prepared for week 11, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to start looking a
little ragged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to turn a little bit yellow,
but they'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a really long sativa,
something that I should mention,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a new grower and you're growing
a long sativa, longer than 11 weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will be lucky if by the end of that
grow, that plant has any big leaves left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants like to, they're finicky and
they will lose a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look like shit, but you'll have
amazing medicine still because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: hardy and a plant that goes that long is
meant to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of experienced growers have a hard
time with a longer flowering plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: the feeding regimen is kind of confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sure when to phase certain
nutrients out and when to phase certain
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in because everything happens at
a different time than what we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: taught about these nine week plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, all the nutrient companies that
sell you stuff, most of the stuff you see
[SPEAKER_01]: online when they're recommending feeding,
they're basing that on about an eight to
[SPEAKER_01]: nine week flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them don't even give you
enough time to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most tell you to flush for one week
because they want you to keep pumping
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking product into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point to all of this is that you
can't really over flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be prepared to flush, flush like
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the plants look like they want
longer, let them go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell if they want to go longer by
using the scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much the only way you can
get in there and tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, something that will give you a hint
of how long the plants are going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: is the basic structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My words are hard to say today,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The basic structure of your plants,
how tall they get, how quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much they branch out, how bushy the
plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it growing straight up?
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant's going straight up and not
making a lot of side branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've probably got yourself a sativa
dominant plant that's going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: little longer to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to keep going straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that is growing
really long, lanky branches, and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: going really, really fast, that plant may
take a little longer to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plant is staying short and stocky
and real squatty and just getting wider
[SPEAKER_01]: and wider as it grows, you've probably got
an indica dominant plant, which is also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to put that trait
together with your leaf size and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: put those two together and let those two
things kind of give you hints of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: indica and how much sativa are in those
plants and how long you should let them
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got seeds and the breeder pack
says that they're done in eight to nine
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, I recommend you let them go nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even let them go a little bit longer
if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to let stuff go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like things to go nine, 10, or 11 weeks
just because it's easier to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of strains that I run.
[SPEAKER_01]: 63 days is perfect for most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is basically ways to figure out
flowering times of new seeds and new
[SPEAKER_01]: clones that you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the trichomes if you've got a scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can hook your scope up to your
computer, I recommend you check in three
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check at the top of the plant,
that big top bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check in the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know how you got the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't do any topping,
you got a top and then there's buds that
[SPEAKER_01]: come up right underneath that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next part of the crown, the next part
of the bouquet, check some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check like right around that ring there
and then go down a little bit further in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and check down there and see how
the difference is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be really amber down at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be really clear at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to harvest one about 30% of the
total trichomes have started to show
[SPEAKER_01]: amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of looks like you got a little
bit of Dr. Pepper on them or a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of root beer or something and they're just
starting to turn a little bit brownish.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wait too long, they all start
turning that color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the kind of the plants lose
their flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cut them a little bit earlier and
they're going to taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut them sooner, they taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut them a little bit later,
they probably get heavier and more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something you want to balance on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are focused on getting as much
as they can from each light or each square
[SPEAKER_01]: foot or each square meter or each table,
however you're growing nowadays and
[SPEAKER_01]: however you're doing the measurement for
your own business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people want to let it go that
extra few days and add on that extra bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, they just get more potent in
my opinion as you let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, that's mostly ways to kind of
predetermine how long to let your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I wrote down a couple
of more notes that I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was inspired to rant on because of
this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I get that far, I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me sound weird when I say that I
need a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to take a dab with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were in a safe place where you
can smoke, start getting a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking the lid off of some Golden Goat
Shatter from TR Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Golden Goat Shatter is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very little left because I really
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep coming up to the table where the
enail is and I'm like, I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: little dab of that Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just get a little dab of it and I
take a dab and I get the flavor on my
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I take just such a little dab that it
doesn't really get me high because I take
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of dabs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a lot of big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be like, shit, I'm going to take
another little dab and I'll take another
[SPEAKER_01]: little dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after like two or three of those,
I'll be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to take a big dab and I'll
take a big dab that I should have just
[SPEAKER_01]: started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I end up really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gram of Golden Goat Shatter has
not lasted very long at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job to whoever grew the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a really good job to our friends
at TR Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: This came out wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just straight shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about different consistencies of
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a little pane of glass
wrapped in parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that sharp because it's more like
Jolly Ranchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you had a sheet of Jolly
Rancher, it would just be snappy like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to fold it back up so that I
can put this away.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the hash onto the dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the hash put away, putting it
back in my childproof child safe
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like keeping it in that container
because it's labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of the flavors over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got me a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm smoking on a quartz bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about some different nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times you see me using the
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever watched me on Instagram,
it's a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made out of titanium and it's got a
cord attached to it and actually attaches
[SPEAKER_01]: to a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that box keeps the nail at the
appropriate temperature for taking dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not using that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is right here next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turned on, but I want to use this rig
that I won.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of looks like a normal bowl,
like a pipe bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically just a little dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dish, it's pinky deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a thimble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a thimble, you guys,
but it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it's got a little piece that
goes into the rig and it goes into the rig
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of like where a bong bowl would
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course I'm using the rig I won
from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pumpkin looking rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with a little pumpkin on the back,
which is the coolest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to heat the banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hard to hear me probably
while I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of compression going on here,
but I don't think it'll cut this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while I heat it, make sure you check
out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a fresh drop of irie genetics
in stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check them out for
feminized and regular cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys are in just a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab of this Golden
Goat and then we will get on with this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate you dabbing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're heating the nail right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My nail has got to cool because I just way
overheated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cleaning off some funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let the nail cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, let's dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feels cool now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bigger than I needed for a podcast,
but what could go wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to sit here and talk into a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent work to my friends at TR
Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Golden Goat Shatter is a maze balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head will quit spinning here in just a
couple of seconds and we're going to move
[SPEAKER_01]: on with the parts that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad I wrote them down because I would
have forgotten by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take one last drink here and then
we'll get on with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I hope you took a fat dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're dabbing with me while you're
listening to the show, send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me at GFYHpodcast on Twitter,
at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know that you're smoking with
me and I'd love to know what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get to the notes that I wrote
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down that phenotype variations
will take different times to flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means if you buy a package of seeds,
not every seed in that package is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get one phenotype that takes nine
weeks and you may get one phenotype that
[SPEAKER_01]: takes 10 weeks to flower out of the same
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the reason for that, I'll explain a
little bit why.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes to do, when I talk about F1 and
F2 breeding and F3 and F4, when you make
[SPEAKER_01]: an F1, it's got a very wide variety of
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll bring out traits from the mother
plant and the father plant that were used,
[SPEAKER_01]: the female and the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the girl plant that received the pollen
and the male plant that threw pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: those traits are going to show,
but also the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever female you used, the male and
female used for that are going to show up
[SPEAKER_01]: in your F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever you used for the male,
the male and female used to make that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to show up in your F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see grandma,
you're going to see grandpa, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're also going to see grandma and
grandpa on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're also going to see mommy
and you're also going to see daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna have a lot of different
phenotypes popping up from some F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may get one that takes eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get one that takes ten weeks,
and this is very possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you make those F1s, there's a lot
of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do as breeders, we find the
most desirable female that you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: out of all of your seeds, out of the F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the one that is whatever you're
looking for, the best stink or the best
[SPEAKER_01]: growth or the best resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the best all-around girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want to take pollen from the
male from the same generation and throw
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen onto that girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seeds that come from there will be
called F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s will be a little bit more stabilized,
meaning you're not gonna see as much
[SPEAKER_01]: representation of the grandparents pop up
in the seeds, but you're gonna see a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit closer to the mommy and daddy,
and you're gonna start narrowing it down a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more closely to what you're
trying to make with that seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something interesting that happens with an
F2 cross is called transgressive
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually see the kids outperform the
parents is generally what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see, and it'll also go the other
way also, you'll see weaker traits also,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we call those as breeders,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see if you put a gigantic male
and a gigantic female, and the male makes
[SPEAKER_01]: super stank and the female makes super
resin, you put them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just may make the super hulk on your
F2s because you're gonna see that
[SPEAKER_01]: transgressive segregation come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly in the F2 generation is where I
find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I would find my favorite F2,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The best looking girl of that F2 that's
got the traits I'm going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it was very similar to the F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You found the one that looked like you
were going after, and then you go find
[SPEAKER_01]: another one that looks like that,
that's an F2 or that's improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hit it with the pollen from
the F2 male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have to find a male and a female,
and then you hit the female with the male
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those seeds come out,
you've now made F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what I'm getting at is every time you
do that, if you do it correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you have to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta keep a bag of seeds from the old
ones and go back and re-hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do it correctly, when you go
through each time, you're going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that strain more stable and more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll start off with like five
different phenotypes and you breed it
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now hopefully you just worked it down
to like three solid phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you breed it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got two solid phenotypes to
where when you grow these plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're 50-50 gonna get this one or this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's going to be kind of like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully you can breed it down
to where by the time you get to F5,
[SPEAKER_01]: which takes a long time, you guys,
that is years of breeding and years of
[SPEAKER_01]: developing, because you've got to find the
males and the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes you don't find what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you finish a crop and you just start
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually searched through,
I'd say 250 seeds to find in a rise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I threw away a good portion of the
females that popped up because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: what I needed at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time you get to the F5,
you'll be growing out these seeds and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will look like clones if you do it
correctly, five or six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think F5 is about where they'll come out
really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: F6 will look like clones, but I wouldn't
want to take it that far because then
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody else could breed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be whatever you bred to it
would come out looking like that all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd just be real dominant genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time you breed to it,
if you do it correctly, it makes it more
[SPEAKER_01]: stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm getting at is a lot of the
breeders on the market right now are
[SPEAKER_01]: selling you F1s, which is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gage Green sells F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite brands to buy is
Gage Green Genetics because I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: variation that comes in the F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to see a lot of neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had the honor of being a tester
for Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to see a lot of great shit come
out of their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to test a lot of great seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love F1s because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may get an F1 that takes eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get an F1 that takes nine weeks
from the same exact pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to cut that one down early and
change your feeding regimen and have two
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants that you've got to feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just want to let them all go 60
days, 64 days, 56 days?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to decide that stuff, but that's a
decision you've got to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can tell early on in flower that
one has kind of taken off and getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit taller than the others,
I mean, you may have some thinking to do
[SPEAKER_01]: right at the beginning there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different seeds are the same seed pack,
different feeding types, you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: different flowering times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love searching through seed packs
and finding the phenotypes because
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what you're working with,
you may find some really great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may also find some ridiculous stuff,
but in the same pack, I have found
[SPEAKER_01]: completely purple buds that were short and
compact and plants make purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: bright purple buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've also had plants that make
tall, velvety, bright green buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't decide which phenotype to
keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept them both and I called them just
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phenohunting is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So expect some variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, something I wrote down is different
flowering times in different rooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I gave you clones, if I gave you
clones and I gave one of your other
[SPEAKER_01]: friends clones and I gave a couple other
guys clones and you guys all took it to
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow room, you may see that your room
wants these plants to flower in 58 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be perfectly finished in 58 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I give somebody else plants,
they may need 63 days if we're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: right down to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So environmental can have a lot to do with
it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, indoors and outdoors, you're going
to see huge differences in different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
