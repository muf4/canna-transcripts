[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go with the Throwback Thursday
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 90 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're an old
[SPEAKER_04]: school smoker, or if you're a Penny Warren
dab kid, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_04]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, This My Friends
[SPEAKER_04]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_04]: letting me play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn on that music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, our friend Jesse came over and
we get recorded for almost two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to stop for a second and fix the
headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tried to crap out on us, but we got
everything back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do a quick ad and then we will
get onto the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, this podcast is brought to you
by my good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_04]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach
Street or check out the Pueblo location on
[SPEAKER_04]: 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_04]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, our good friend Jesse works at
Hygro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the manager there.
[SPEAKER_04]: His wife is probably who you'll bump into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either Bernadette or LaDonna is most
likely who you're going to see when you go
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple other folks that work
there, but it's most of the time it's
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse, Bern, or LaDonna.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you go in there, you're shopping
with my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, these are really cool people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are members of the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not just sales folks with a
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're there to help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So make sure you support our friends at
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you are checking out at Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies, make sure you let
[SPEAKER_04]: them know you listen to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast and they will give you
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial pricing on your entire
purchase.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll save you a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys, I've been rambling
long enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let this music fade out and
we will be right back with our good friend
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I am back and sitting
across the table from me is our good buddy
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've been a busy man,
so it's always good having you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grower season.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is farmer season.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, I just threw on the
microphones real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to do a podcast and then
Jesse mentioned something and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit record.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse just said, if you were using general
organics to not adjust the pH when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: done, I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what did you say to use to adjust the
pH if you had to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying that it's built into the
formula.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CA Mag Plus or Cali Plus that it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pH buffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not exactly sure on the entire science
of it, but I do know for a fact that if
[SPEAKER_03]: you try to pH it, it will mess your shit
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have some funky looking
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because if you're using organics,
it's organic and if you go and pour acids
[SPEAKER_04]: in there that we're using, I think it's a
phosphoric acid which is the pH down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the word acid in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tells you that it's going to go in
there and start destroying all of your
[SPEAKER_04]: organics and your micro life.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just wanted to get that on
recording, guys, since we were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the best shit comes out before I
turn on the microphones and I always feel
[SPEAKER_04]: like, damn, I wasted some time there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to put on the mics and
get that on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse, welcome to the show, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate having you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all choked up from some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get official.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited Jesse over to do a podcast and
my topic was our friend John Rossum on
[SPEAKER_04]: Periscope asked if he can grow his bag
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The short answer is, hell yes,
you can grow your bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a really long answer also.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I want to mention though,
a lot of the older cats that I try to
[SPEAKER_04]: pitch my seeds to are flabbergasted and
blown away by the price of a 10 pack of
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately, a 10 pack of seeds will go,
it depends on the breeder, anywhere from
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 to 100 bucks for a 10 pack of good
regular or feminized.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen swan boys are doing 180 now for
a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these higher known companies are
definitely able to get more money,
[SPEAKER_04]: 150 to 200 bucks for a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are going to say,
what the hell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then some of these old guys, they say,
but dude, I've got a big baggie of seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: in my closet from when I used to smoke pot
and sift it out on a record cover,
[SPEAKER_04]: on an album cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those seeds are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend you grow those, but do not try
to sell those.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason they aren't sellable the reason
that the seeds us breeders are selling and
[SPEAKER_04]: pushing and promoting, the reason they
cost more money is because we know what
[SPEAKER_04]: the parents are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know what's going to come from those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done time selecting the male and
female to produce a seed line that has
[SPEAKER_04]: probably gone several years in testing and
development to figure out what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: No herms, high quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and consistency is something I
really, no herms, a lot of quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: good resin production, good flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some plants when you get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked strains down from 90 day
flowering times by breeding it into other
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've cut it down by breeding several
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've brought it to 60 days and it's still
pretty much the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we've done is breed it to shorter
flowering plants, put it to the flow,
[SPEAKER_04]: grow the seeds that come from that out,
find the one that's a lot like the
[SPEAKER_04]: original male or female, whichever we're
trying to do, and then put that back to
[SPEAKER_04]: flow because flow is a quick plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We spread things to flow and sped it up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It passes on traits really well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, she does.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are looking to start a
breeding project, get a Colorado Flow and
[SPEAKER_04]: play with her because that's a fun one to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm getting at is those bag seeds
that these older cats or maybe you younger
[SPEAKER_04]: cats have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason those aren't marketable and
sellable is because you don't know the
[SPEAKER_04]: parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know the genetic heritage of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not a marketable seed,
but you can definitely give them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can definitely grow this shit out of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow your bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have hermaphrodites,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have a bunch of males.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have shitty, ass ragweed,
but you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: You very well could have something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see something good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's getting excited over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.
Kim Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can barely fucking ... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just blurted out exactly the strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kim Dog came from ... Kim Dog was fucking
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kim Dog is known as one of the strongest
strains on earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been on the cover of High Times
Magazine three or four times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the single strongest strain on earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, that was old bag seed when strains
weren't ... This is a really deep
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get way into the Kim Dog story.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't just a bunch of junk strains
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there was, but it's ... Chances
are if somebody grew ... If you bought
[SPEAKER_04]: that bag of weed and it had a seed in
there, chances are it was decent weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing is we don't know what it
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ... A lot of people back in the day
don't even know what the girl plant they
[SPEAKER_04]: got or what the buds they got were.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to say this is like Acapulco
Gold or something, but it was just
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever that dude said it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was before we really knew and cared a
lot about genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, on things you could get,
you could even get Mexican auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people want those Mexican auto
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people would love to have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people message me all the time asking
when I'm going to make auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was never supposed to be about my
brand or my company, but I read genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: will never make auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe in the use of auto
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually straying far away from
feminized seeds because I like the males
[SPEAKER_04]: in the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we need male plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feminized seeds, I can't make enough
feminized seeds to keep people happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want so many of them damn things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse hit the nail right on the head when
he said you could have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem dog came from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two dudes sold a guy a bag of weed on a
grateful dead parking lot in 95,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem dog found seeds in that weed and he
grew that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of one of those seeds, and you guys go
Google the legend of chem dog and the 13
[SPEAKER_04]: beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening to this podcast and
you want to be deep into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: culture and you want to know some
heritage, Google chem dog and the legend
[SPEAKER_04]: of the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I got to give a big shout out to the
Adam Dunn show, a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do an entire episode where chem dog
actually calls in and they discuss where
[SPEAKER_04]: this stream came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the people that were in the chain
of that and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all call in.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were on the old school forums if
any of the listeners are forum junkies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They already know the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write this down.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day we're going to have to talk about
OG and if OG means overgrow or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get a few older growers on here
and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I just said OG, I meant overgrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You meant overgrow the website,
overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a website that we used to frequent
and talk about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Subcool was on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the cool breeders were on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a theory that the OG Kush came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Overgrow, but also people think it's the
original gangster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also heard it ocean grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that on this show in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a few more OGs on the show to come
talk with us on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so grow out those bag seeds
because you could have chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, you could also have junk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could totally have junk, but here's a
little pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sell clones of junk.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in Colorado, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't sell your junkie seeds from
your junkie clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really rude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is rude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disrespectful to your customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disrespectful to your patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disrespectful to the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disrespectful to the future of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow a plant and you take clones of
it, don't give those clones out until you
[SPEAKER_04]: have flowered the damn plant and you
verified that it's something worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many strains available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow something worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a breeder, it is so hard to breed
something and then grow a hundred seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and realize that you have just created
fucking hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: The strain doesn't do us any good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got 6,000 seeds of it and all I'm
going to do is feed them to some birds
[SPEAKER_04]: because I don't want anybody growing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one cross that it was a lemon
Kush idea and dude, it grew the fattest,
[SPEAKER_04]: chunkiest, tallest nuggets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were bigger than my arms.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have any flavor or any resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just grew the biggest hemp ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have horrible herming problems and all
my interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because so much of it's involved with
ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to breed with ChemDog,
make sure you back cross or out cross that
[SPEAKER_04]: hermit trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go find a two solid progeny from your F1s
and work those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going ahead of myself here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's hard to guess what
pollinated the seeded buds that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got, but you know that that female makes
quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the donor was a male in the room,
maybe something hermed, but it's probably
[SPEAKER_04]: just a stress seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually a light leak or something
like that is what's causing these bag
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overnuting, irregular watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, surprises.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprises on the plants, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get them too hot and let them get
too dry, they'll start throwing out seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: A seed is the plant's response of,
oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant goes, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to die here soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a horny person.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the plant's whole mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: The resin is there to protect the plant so
that it can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pistols, which everybody calls hairs,
those are there to collect pollen so that
[SPEAKER_04]: it can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is all about these plants
reproducing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you piss off a plant, it will try to
make a seed as a reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wants to make sure that it
continues.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't want to be wiped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's its purpose is to reproduce and
continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tricking it in many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be respectful to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had a list of which strains
were, here they are, Gorilla Glue number
[SPEAKER_04]: four and seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the Gorilla Glue strains were
actually- Bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Accidental pollinations that created seeds
that Josie Wales, shout out to Josie
[SPEAKER_04]: Wales, a grower slash breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're glad that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for popping those beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Goat, one of Colorado's most
popular strains ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my most popular strains for my
growing, my photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, a lot of people give me credit
for breeding Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say right now, I did not
breed the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Goat was bred by a guy known as Mr.
Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an accident that was not meant to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's headphones are cutting out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give him a pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I think we're back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we recorded all the first part,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using the Zoom H6 Handy Recorder
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure I recorded that first
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_04]: This Livewire Solutions HA04 four-channel
stereo headphone amplifier, it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get a hammer put to it pretty soon here
because it just pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we were on Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was saying that I did not breed the
Golden Goat, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Dank read that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topeka, Kansas of all places.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, however, get a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first started breeding,
I thought I hit Topeka, Kansas of all damn
[SPEAKER_04]: places.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost skipped right over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the coolest town in
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to vote for Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to vote for Lawrence,
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done things in Lawrence,
Kansas that I can't even talk about on
[SPEAKER_04]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: My boss got T-boned in that there's an
army base outside of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got T-boned there, so we ended up
spending a day and a half in Lawrence,
[SPEAKER_03]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the Kansas I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a club every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like the Boulder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the liberal stronghold of that city.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topeka is pretty close, too, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we went to Topeka.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to Wichita.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived in Lawrence for a little while,
so I had a good time there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Golden Goat, I got a hold of a clone
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good friend, Josh, a long time ago gave
me a clone of that, the Hawaiian guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call him the Hawaiian guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call him Pineapple Express is what I
used to call him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't hung out with that dude in a
long-ass time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pineapple Express brought me a clone of
the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first started breeding,
one of my ideas was I felt bad that in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado, we had all of the elite genetics
and everybody in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never felt bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a compassionate guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, how do I get these clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I can't get you clones of
these elite cuts, but I will make seeds of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: My idea was to make seeds of the Golden
Goat just by reversing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did put seeds of the Golden Goat out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the one that made the S1 feminized
Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I know, I'm the only one that
has done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put about 5,000 of those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and I think Scott's done something
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Gage make one strain with Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Ali, fuck, what's his seed company
name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ali G.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dude out of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Ali G or Al G.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to Google this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spelled phonetically, but he's bred a
couple of strains with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great plant, but it was like we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was from a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado takes pretty much all the credit
for that, but that is definitely a local
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's partly my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pain in the ass to keep a mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to take clones from that Golden
Goat often.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got one, hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you in a few more years,
a lot of strains are getting harder to
[SPEAKER_03]: find.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good original.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old school blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show me a good Kim 4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a P-91 clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, everyone used to grow Romulan.
I've heard a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm going to give you a shout
out right quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse is actually the moderator and he's
the one that started the, what's the name
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Facebook group?
[SPEAKER_03]: Coloradoap Cannabis Growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys join Jesse's Facebook group if
you're serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will troll you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have a little bit of thick
skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're not an internet vagina
because I'm a troll and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: you, but it's a fun group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They help you learn about cannabis in a
fun, positive way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will clear up all the rumors and myths.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a question, come join the
group.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a cannabis grower, if you're
curious about cannabis, we love teaching
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love sharing and it's another avenue to
do that and it's free.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a total noob, not to be a dick,
but there are better groups to find this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This group is comprised of growers only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be shy you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a question, or hit me up on
Facebook or Jesse directly and we will
[SPEAKER_04]: answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse may take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't carry the iPhone like I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not attached to it like I am,
but I've usually got the phone in my
[SPEAKER_04]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm working at the spot, I've got the
phone turned off because there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: service back there anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, our facility is like a fucking bomb
shelter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can live back there for six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to turn a radio on in the middle of it
when all the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you get cavitas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that still does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're way off topic here, but in Denver,
you guys, this is something that I
[SPEAKER_04]: recently heard and or read about and had a
conversation with multiple people about.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Denver, they're driving around.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're running old school magnetic
ballasts, I'm not sure if the new digitals
[SPEAKER_04]: will do it, but the old school magnetics,
if you're running enough of those,
[SPEAKER_04]: they put off an AM frequency.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take an AM radio in that room,
you have it tuned into the station,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's working, you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you walk near those ballasts,
it will cut out and make a weird humming
[SPEAKER_04]: noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at a specific frequency too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried it on a couple of places I know
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes a hum and some dashes and beeps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely puts off a unique signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Denver police are using an ultra
sensitive radio.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're driving around neighborhoods and
when they get that, they're driving back
[SPEAKER_04]: by with infrared cameras.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're checking your lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they've done that, they're going back
home or back to the station and checking
[SPEAKER_04]: to see if you're a medical marijuana
caregiver so that you've got permission to
[SPEAKER_04]: have all these lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since in the state of Colorado,
we're only supposed to have six plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you've got all that light, you're
supposed to be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're registered as a grower,
if you're not, they go and knock on your
[SPEAKER_04]: door and ask what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Denver, be careful if you've got those
magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the cops or for the guys using
magnetic ballasts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come buy some Nanos from me or our Denver
store on Beach Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask for Brandon or Cassandra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cassandra, that's the chick you'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the Denver store?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Denver store.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been to the Denver store so I
may have to drop in there and just go
[SPEAKER_04]: wander around and not even tell them who I
am and just walk around and look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: store.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to do that when they don't know who
I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting high and getting off topic
here but we've had a few dabs so that's
[SPEAKER_04]: okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be controversial here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot prove this but it is my theory
that the Girl Scout cookies is probably a
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck up and it was an accident and it's a
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they bred that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bred with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason I haven't released any of
my stuff yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have very high standards and I haven't
been able to achieve them yet but Girl
[SPEAKER_03]: Scout cookies in my opinion is a herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not breed stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've crossed it to the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a really neat breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a really neat plant to breed with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah but it produces hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it to the Grateful Dog and you would
not believe what it put out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you a little bit after we record
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a couple other people that have
grown that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: After breeding with it and growing and
seeing a couple different hybrids of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can recognize it real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to go bag seeds,
I already said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be careful for
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're growing these bag seeds,
treat it just like a normal seed during
[SPEAKER_04]: veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to know what the parents
are so you're going to have to pay a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of attention to it during flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start flowering, you have to look
every single day for hermaphrodite flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: on these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes twice a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out for males too.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the first three weeks, look out for
males.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had plants surprise me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were full on female until
about day 20 and then it popped open a nut
[SPEAKER_04]: sack somewhere and I'm like oh that's got
to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for male flowers, herm flowers all
over the entire plant once or twice a day
[SPEAKER_04]: through the entire bloom cycle of a bag
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a seed for a reason and it could
herm out in the end of week eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it does, you either need to be able to
harvest it before it produces a seed or
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to get in there and be able to
tweeze out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it makes one or two male flowers,
sometimes you can pull them out with
[SPEAKER_04]: tweezers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spray the plant with a water bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mist it a little bit because mist
deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moisture will ruin pollen so give it a
nice mist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in there with some tweezers and pull
out those male flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put them in a trash bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw them away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got in an argument with someone in
Facebook land the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted a picture of a friend's hemp
plant, a male, and he told me that that
[SPEAKER_03]: growth spot was ruined for life and that
pollen doesn't die and it travels for
[SPEAKER_03]: hundreds of miles and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything to say about that,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to go to that forum or that
post and just troll that guy is what I
[SPEAKER_04]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, pollen, you can get rid of
pollen quite easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweep the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in there with some water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water deactivates pollen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very fragile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to store, in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hard to store.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to keep it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep my pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have little vials of pollen that are
sealed and they are inside of another jar
[SPEAKER_04]: that is sealed and that is inside of a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stays dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how careful I am with my pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, Rusty?
[SPEAKER_04]: Rusty threw a bunch of pollen on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time he was here, he dropped off
like four or five little bags of pollen,
[SPEAKER_04]: so there may be some Canaventure iry
crosses coming up in the near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where all my Yeti stuff came from
was a friendly pollen delivery from
[SPEAKER_03]: someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, shout out to that Yeti OG that you
made live resin with last summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff was memorable, remarkable,
legendary.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was some good shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish that was back around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Spence.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one that made that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was the cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, I get to be in the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had some good runs back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like everybody got busy and carried
away and all the hash artists got too busy
[SPEAKER_04]: and were just all disconnected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Need to all reconnect again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need everybody on the podcast again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, you got to come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get a party going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't all connected in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 100 is coming up, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be number 90,
I think, right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do an intro for it, but I think
this is number 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So number 100 is coming up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any cool ideas, if you want to
be on episode number 100, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hiregenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do you have to add about bag
seed, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was assuming, alleging that Girl Scout
cookies was probably an accident and came
[SPEAKER_04]: from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of my theory on that is because I've
heard so many different rumors and legends
[SPEAKER_04]: of how it was made and who made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that are alleged to have made
it have never said what it is and they
[SPEAKER_04]: won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it's an effluent dervish is what I
hear a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll call them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've said straight up, they've said two
or three different stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't even believe anything they
said at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read at least three different stories
in high times and they all say they came
[SPEAKER_04]: from the same people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has it and that's a bunch of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have Girl Scout cookies yet
by now, let us know because everybody in
[SPEAKER_04]: our crew has a, I've got the platinum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the forum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got cookies and cream by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got cookie rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's cookies times everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know people that are done with it
and letting it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much all that Maddie and
Spence want to smoke is cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's still one of my favorite smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some in the cloner now,
so let me know if you want another one
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spread that around good.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want something, go to the
forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two sources for two or three good
sources for clones around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them, he gets everything from
the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's kind of a quiet guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does not look like a pot grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks like he probably would work on
computers or study law somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he shows up with a briefcase and
opens it up and drops me off a few
[SPEAKER_04]: cuttings of some elite shit that he got
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when clones come from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it seems like right around the
same time he gets them, either you or
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence will end up with the same cuttings
and you guys will throw me a cut or I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: trade you a cut just because that's how
our group works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll run them side by side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm always so amazed that everybody
got the same cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how did Spence end up with this Girl
Scout cookies and my other friend ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: with the Girl Scout cookies and I ran them
and there's the same fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they started from the same seed
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I mean, just seeing,
I mean, we've all grown enough of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell instantly if it's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do all these people on the internet
have the same fricking thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting around.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are flying.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're taking a horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, if you get some weed,
if you get some good quality cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's got a couple of healthy, good looking
seeds in there and you don't have money to
[SPEAKER_04]: spend on some high quality seeds that we
know all the history behind them and they
[SPEAKER_04]: were bred by magic elves in a dungeon in
Quebec.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being a smartass here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you if you don't want to pay good
money for seeds, if you don't have access
[SPEAKER_04]: to good clones, just throw some of those
bag seeds in a paper towel, germinate
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start them out just like you would any
other seeds and pay a lot of attention and
[SPEAKER_04]: then grow them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something I really have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a fucking clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, you wouldn't believe how many
people say, look what I grew from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, can I get a clone of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, I didn't take any
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude, take a clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take a little clone, you dip it some
shit and you put it in a router.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it herms really bad, don't take a
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if it herms, throw away those
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it grows balls, throw away all the
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow more seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because your bag seeds are free.
[SPEAKER_04]: You already paid 50 bucks for that eight
or whatever you paid for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you grow the seeds that are in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you could have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could grow the next Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could grow the next Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could grow the next Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have the next OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: SFV, Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's another one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Crippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crippy.
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single strain we're smoking came
from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of one strain that didn't
come from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can, I'll give you $100.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because every fucking cannabis plant we
were smoking came from a seed somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow out that bag seed,
you could have a cup winner right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of times, if you don't even
know what it was bred with, that's yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to give anybody credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You found that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got the Jesse's pride and joy
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when the Cannabis Cup winnings come
up, they go, and the winner for the most
[SPEAKER_04]: heady indica here in Denver, Colorado,
with the Cannabis Cup goes to Jesse for
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's Mystery Funk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there you go, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just won that Cannabis Cup with a bag
seed that you found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem dog did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why couldn't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: True story.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been rambling a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think we're, I think it might
be, we've been going for close to 30
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could probably start wrapping up this
part, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, we tried to wrap up this
episode, but the conversation kept going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I decided to do was to make this a
two-part episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will drop episode number 91 Thursday
morning, and that will be part two of
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse and I hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank you guys for listening
to this episode.

[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out yo!
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've been rambling enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost a two minute intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get right down to the part where
Jesse and I are talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Jesse, I basically said,
do you have any guidance that you would
[SPEAKER_04]: like to share with our listeners?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here is what Jesse had to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sell junk clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sell junk clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sell untested seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sell clones of plants from seed
that you haven't even flowered yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard so many horror stories at the
grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so bad for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help them, but it really sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do that stuff, do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get a bag seed out of... What's
this hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is star dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking a dab of star dog from... Just
give it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you... What was I even going to say
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get a bag seed of it and you grow
it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if you grow some weed and it's got a
bunch of seeds in it, that star dog plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: just because it's wholly seeded to fuck,
doesn't mean you can call those seeds star
[SPEAKER_04]: dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not star dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are unknown seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you hit that star dog girl with
male star dog pollen or manipulated the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant in some other fashion to create
these S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not exactly it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My thing is if you don't know what did it,
don't call it star dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there could have been some pollen
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been another one of the
plants that hermed on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been a male in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If all you had was seven star dog plants
in there, I guess you do have star dog
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you light stressed it and it produced a
bunch of seeds, you do now have star dog
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been a really special
recessive clone phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: What comes out is the dominant piece of
junk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to see grandpa when you grow
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to see what the grandpa was.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to see what grandma was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes those plants were shitty or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of what we have now, the plants that
we're growing now are like your dad's
[SPEAKER_04]: fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's dad is an old time grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the ones who chose some of the
genetics we're working with now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to steal streetlights and they
had to use shitty soil and they had to
[SPEAKER_04]: hide.
[SPEAKER_04]: They couldn't run too much electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know what the hell they were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the shittiest books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything in the books back then was hand
drawn.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were stealing electricity back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand drawn books that you had to go to
shady ass head shops to buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take this dad here and then
we'll start doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That generation is responsible for the
plants that we have now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the guys that went to war in other
countries brought back seeds from those
[SPEAKER_04]: regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They found that some were too damn tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They found that some took way too long and
they got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you bro, I bet now that we've got
room and space and lights and technology,
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet some of the gold was thrown the fuck
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a bag of old school seeds,
if you're like 50 or 60 years old and
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got a big sandwich bag full of
seeds that you had when you were,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's see, I want to go back to the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got some 35 year old seeds,
40 year old seeds and you want to share
[SPEAKER_04]: them, send Jesse and I a sandwich bag full
and we will grow the shit out of them and
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll take pictures and we'll give you a
clone of our favorite shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some pretty old seeds the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Mr. G and I can't remember is
a llama box llama box.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the hookup guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of llama box is very familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I know llama box?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He won a yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of the winners for the 50 show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his little Twitter icon is a little
llama getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was taking a dab and that still made
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to green and healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, while I'm thinking about it,
you guys, I wrote down to say this,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to say it in the intro,
but I just took a dab and I want to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure I don't forget green and healthy
wellness is not closed forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know I hyped this shop in Colorado
spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to damsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Haley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Jordan Jordan's and John
Randall's Jr. But, uh, they had to shut
[SPEAKER_04]: their doors for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: The building, I don't know how much of
this business is mine to air.
[SPEAKER_04]: The building in which they were located
was sold and the new owner did not want a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is basically the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were forced to move.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a new location.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time you hear this, it is likely
that they are open to back for business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they are not, trust me,
you guys, green and healthy wellness,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, I saw them working to tear down the
building and it was like army ants and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just going buck wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was sweaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And had this stressful look.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're getting the grow too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They moved everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are eager to get the new facility
open.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not gone forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, the turpax hookup at green and
healthy wellness will be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damsel will be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I understand it right, they actually
got a better building.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a better location.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: That building was a little tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: The parking would get a little cramped in
there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they will be back and it will be better
than ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that a lot of people rely on them
for their medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they are a medical only shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of patients are looking for a new
spot for medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt was here the other day at the house
and hung out and we did make promises to
[SPEAKER_04]: record together very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That episode will feature the lovely dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's damsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a little famous on the inner web.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, she is a little popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: She gave me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent her up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took, I'm sure I've talked about it on
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing a strain called damsel's day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hunting from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running three different seed lines of
stuff that I've crossed and I'm looking to
[SPEAKER_04]: find her favorite phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to name that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damsel's dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be marketed at the
dispensary that I represent and the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary that she represents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I took a picture of the seedling
and sent it to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said the beginning and she put that
on Instagram and within an hour I had a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred new followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's damsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's hard to pick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll be, uh, yeah, but that'll be
a little bit popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll get some stuff going for both of
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exposed both brands genetics, the suicide
girls, dude, it's damsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, hunt will be part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grammy Gatsby will be part of
advertising green and healthy wellness
[SPEAKER_04]: will be carrying the flowers for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, in the near future, the spot will have
the flowers, but you guys, this is a year
[SPEAKER_04]: long project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think that something, this is
something that's going to happen in a few
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we bred a strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bred a seed line.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bred three seed lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we took those seed lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: They germinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are now in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just got put into three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I've got a run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think 22 of them out of the
original, I think 30 started 22 of them
[SPEAKER_04]: have made it to where I think they'll make
it to the flower room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may take one or two out.
[SPEAKER_04]: One's too tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's a boy I could tell just by
looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I kind of want to just pull that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they'll flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they're flowered, there's a private
party set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the date's already been chosen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a location being put together and
the Grammy Gatsby is going to throw a
[SPEAKER_04]: tasting party and there will be score
cards and video done and full on reviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're taking this one quite
seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this just a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if he was actually taking the
seeds to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two year project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would want to run at least a
hundred of those seeds myself after I ran
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 or 50 of them myself, I would start
sending 10 packs out to friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd give you 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow these now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fuck around, grow these now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them out to friends that are eager to
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would grow them right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would send me pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would send me feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're local, I get to go,
I get to go to Roster Ralph's garden and
[SPEAKER_04]: look at my blue healer growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to go to people's places and see my
plants growing in their garden to get
[SPEAKER_04]: feedback, which improves my breeding
because then I could say, Oh God,
[SPEAKER_04]: I never want to breed with that fucking
plant ever again.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the blue healer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue healer is the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grateful dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Spencer for the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I'm going to cross the blue
dream and the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, that's a blue healer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just spit it out like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the name it got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got packs of seeds for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, I don't think I've ever grown a
blue dream cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my favorite strain in the world
to be honest, but that was kind of my
[SPEAKER_04]: goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Colorado was in love with blue dream
and the girls in California are in love
[SPEAKER_04]: with blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cash crop plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have some additional value,
but it, it's used too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a cash crop plant for what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's, uh, and I forgot the cross of it
suddenly that it's blueberry and silver
[SPEAKER_04]: haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by DJ shorts son or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: JD short or his son in law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'm not sure if that's
actually true because I, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's up for debate guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know the truth of where the blue
dream came from a couple of stories,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's a haze and it's a blue dream and
it's got some OG, I think in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you would think from what I've read,
I remember thinking that would be the
[SPEAKER_04]: ideal strain, but then I remember getting
my hands on a couple of different grows of
[SPEAKER_04]: it and smoking it and being like,
this is mediocre, but there's an amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking phenotype of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Andy's blue dream phenotype is the
most impressive I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's, it's just a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, it's labeled ABD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to think that's just the blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all over Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure it's the one I bred too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but the blue dream kicks out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pull two pounds under a thousand
watt light and soil with that blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut was a short, short veg time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a one with a real short veg time
last year outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did like three and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but the problem is it doesn't have
an appealing high to me and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: make enough hash to make it worth its
time, space, energy, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever else, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I could replace that with a bounty killer
and have way better medicine if it smelled
[SPEAKER_03]: like it, or if it tasted like it smelled
to be the most popular strain in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my goal when I hit it with the
grateful dog was to put that resin on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, and it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made it short into the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made the plants a little stockier and
it puts some resin and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: funk to it, which was what all that's all
the blue dream was missing was resin and
[SPEAKER_04]: funk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was getting too tall for a lot of
indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet the DJ short came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anything with his stuff always
seems to be really dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot, you know, that says a lot for
his breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because he's taken it to the F five
before he releases his packages,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has a style of his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've heard him argue with many people,
um, on podcasts and interviews.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a couple of minutes ago,
uh, I dissed the old generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, DJ short is the old generation,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to give him mad love.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of the guys back in the day that
was doing it right for genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it weren't for DJ short, I don't think
you and I would be where we are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ's done a lot for the preservation and
just everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I might be a brick in the wall,
but DJ short was part of the foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up there with some of the original
authors and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're guys like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll give sub cool mad credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, he's not as old as sub cool or as a
DJ short, but he's in that generation
[SPEAKER_04]: between them, between us and DJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to give him mad love for his
breeding and for what he did for the
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, since we're shutting our readers and
if we're going to go with old guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys know I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soma deserves a high five and a hug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big namaste to Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soma taught me how to grow on OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not know anything about,
I'd never, I'd read so much posts,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I never realized he was a dreadlock
and I never knew he was a dirty hippie and
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know he had amethyst everywhere
and crystals on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured he was an Indian dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the country India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend Donovan, one day who was a
big user of overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was always on there and one day he's
like, bro, you remind me so much of Soma
[SPEAKER_04]: the way that you talk because I was
preaching my grow from your heart theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like go in your grow room and I still
think this, you got to go in your grow
[SPEAKER_04]: room once in a while and just sit there
and just meditate and just close your eyes
[SPEAKER_04]: and think about the goodness that those
plants are going to do because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing a plant that is going to heal
somebody in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they're a recreational smoker,
if they're a medical smoker, somebody is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be up lifted and better because
of the product that you're growing and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's got to feel good inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go in there and kind of meditate a
little bit on that and feel that golden.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd share it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants love me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they heal somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that person hugs me when they see me
and the next time they go, dude,
[SPEAKER_04]: that great dog was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get to go grow better weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got a good hug and it just
perpetuates this golden cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was talking about that exact hippie
shit that I just said, and my buddy's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, dude, you're like fucking Soma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I've heard of Soma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read his posts and he's like,
no, go get his book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went and got his book and I was
like, this guy is who I was going to be in
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years if I didn't know there was
already this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was already on the path of being Soma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got off on a random tangent of
giving a DJ short.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did no till organic before any of y'all
thought of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As cool as it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's doing nothing new there.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soma has been on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 4x4 beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I built them out of Rubbermaid containers,
but I used the same principle with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drainage and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can support 99% of what Soma says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Subcool, I love his growing style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes he says some shit that I'm not
going to put my signature on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't discredit that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude's got fucking integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's made a lot of strains and he was one
of the first people to take good pictures
[SPEAKER_03]: with a good camera buds and send them into
high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that's followed me on Facebook
since the beginning knows without any
[SPEAKER_04]: saying that fucking Subcool inspired 50%
of my photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I got a lot of the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a real similar style now
that you mention it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our grow style, our photography style.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that until someone's like,
you should check out the Weed Nerd.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot to learn in some of his
older episodes if you're interested in the
[SPEAKER_03]: way he does things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Subcool on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sound like an old guy when I say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Weed Nerd.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The older stuff is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came a point when it got to be too
redundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: He headbangs for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even he knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it all the time in the new ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting to 100 episodes and there's
only so much you could talk about about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always news and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I fall to the news sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we get to episode 100, we're going to
go a little more in depth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone through the basics and now it's
time to dig in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our friends are listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really great tool for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been opening Periscope and doing
random shit on there occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've got this good foundation,
you guys have had your basic rudimentary
[SPEAKER_04]: classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's almost time around episode
100 to start pushing it and start going to
[SPEAKER_04]: the B level courses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to college level.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get Sean back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to get out the notepad again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do this right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 201s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap this part up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Jesse, thanks for coming,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do an outdoor update real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here lately in southern Colorado at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been cold and humid at night and
hot and dry during the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: True that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a recipe for powdery mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bud rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the reason Cali Bud stands
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get a marine layer with this too,
but this year I've seen a lot of Cali
[SPEAKER_03]: style or what I always call Cali style
problems that we've never had here before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be prepared for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we prevent getting powdery mildew
with these crispy cold nights that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of moisture in the air
tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can already feel it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any number of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm personally using Actinovate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in bloom too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it on the cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it on the squash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it on the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really affect cannabis from
what I've seen and been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's an indication that the climate
for it to grow is present.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak on that now, but within the
next 30 days, I am going to become what is
[SPEAKER_04]: called applicator certified by the
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cousin's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked at the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an open book test.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm now the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself and my friend John are now the lead
growers at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we had our first pre-inspection
from the Department of Agriculture before
[SPEAKER_04]: we grow anything in our new grow areas.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only been out of the industry for
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine months?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, things have changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have a Department of
Agriculture meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about an hour and a half long
meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They told us basically what we need to do
to be complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The boss is going to pay for it,
of course, because it's a work-related
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that I feel like I should
do anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they offered that course,
I was like, I want to go to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within 30 days, I have to take the test
within 30 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kudos to the spot, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some owners would be really pissed
about having to do shit like this.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the cannabis industry- Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to, allegedly, you've got to
spend money to fucking make money in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is hard to survive right now if you
don't have some money to put in inventory.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your shelves aren't stocked with 20
different kinds of buds, if your shelves
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't stocked with 20 different kinds of
edibles or different topicals,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lollipop over here, some t-shirts over
here, socks over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got to fill every revenue
channel- Japanese or Chinese water pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good water pipes, Chinese water pipes,
knockoff nails, high-end nails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Three Rivers Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got some cool hitman shit in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, your eyes are really red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took a fat dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm over here coughing and only
saying short sentences.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it match my red and my shirt yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, let's go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Actinovate, Green Cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really see that as a preventative,
but if you do use it, make sure you use it
[SPEAKER_03]: at night and follow the directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of stuff you can be
spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stay away from neem oil since all
your plants should be in bloom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gifted a product called stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a consultation and somebody,
an older gentleman who is not as
[SPEAKER_04]: able-bodied as most of us, he's a little
slower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might call him handicapped.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's trying to grow his own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's his first grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his second grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him a free consultation and he had
just the starts of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, man, and he was in about
starting week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, man, I don't really want you
to spray anything on there, but you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to lose your crop if you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I Googled some stuff and they say
oils and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, don't put neem oil on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, put some worm casting tea on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The worm didn't do a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's most definitely preventative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him, I said, this crop is going to
be fucked because the powdery mildew was
[SPEAKER_04]: getting, it wasn't thick, but you could
see it popping up in the little circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I've got a product called stylet
oil that I've never used.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine sent it to me to
encourage me to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that it will destroy powdery
mildew on contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, spray it on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an old dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, this is your medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spray that on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew what I was doing and it was his
decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sprayed the stylet oil on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit took down the powdery mildew on
contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: It destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never actually used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard you can burn the shit out some
plants with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the things a guy named,
I don't know if I should say his real
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's known as tree town is what I know him
as a tree town farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one that recommended this to me
and hooked me up with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A vendor for the product, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have anything to use it on in my
grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have any mildew or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When this dude was like, I got powdery
mildew, I was like, this is what I've got
[SPEAKER_04]: to offer you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about the way that it coats the
leaves, it breaks the membrane of the
[SPEAKER_04]: powdery mildew and it doesn't allow it to
grow on your leaf is basically what I
[SPEAKER_04]: read.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that shit hit the leaf, it just
washed it right off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it with the lights off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn the lights off, just turn a normal
lamp on.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you should with most pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: With any spray you want the lights on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few that you actually need the
lights on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you need to heat the room up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually need to heat the room to
activate the oils in the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sprayed it with the stylet oil and then
let it sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we went back the next morning and
rinsed the stylet oil off with just clean
[SPEAKER_04]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also very important for most pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you want to unclog the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to be able to breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rinse that shit off and then those plants
just came out of it and they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got to harvest his crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was several weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got to harvest his crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped him trim some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed him how to trim it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No signs of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gorgeous crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smelled pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't smoked any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it tastes like stylet oil,
but he's an older cat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like your dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just needs a bunch of herb to smoke so
he doesn't get hurt and lose his damn
[SPEAKER_03]: mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is stylet oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it in this room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have had it handy before I
brought it up, but I wasn't prepared for
[SPEAKER_04]: that so fail on my part.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a white oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some research on it once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not colored white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just considered a white oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not thick and white or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I heard about it, it was kind of
pre-Amazon times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available now and it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually quite affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a preventative as an outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need to rescue something,
it's something you can look into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Cure, if you hit it just right,
will take care of a light infestation,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's kind of touchy too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything when you're in the flowering
phase and applying a foliar spray of any
[SPEAKER_04]: type is a touchy situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: De-leafing, just removing the leaf and
taking it out of the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washing your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't touch them when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been told it spreads easier at that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I've been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been able to work too much,
but I haven't had the need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got powdery mildew in your grow
room, you've got something to correct in
[SPEAKER_04]: the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some work to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take you a little bit to fix
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot spray away that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an environmental problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to clean it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to start getting fresh air into
the room, stale air out of the room,
[SPEAKER_04]: lower the humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get it also, don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can even happen outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about having it in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened the first time I moved into a
new house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was August when I moved in,
so it was warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that first winter crop, I got powdery
mildew in the back corner of the room
[SPEAKER_04]: because it was the concrete basement wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's drastic climate change or season
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to run that room in the fall
probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Powdery mildew, boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a damn master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been told that when I talk about
powdery mold, both of us have been told
[SPEAKER_03]: that we make people feel bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't feel bad if it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: A person at the store told me that the
other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I post amazing pictures on
Instagram, but it's because I just don't
[SPEAKER_04]: take pictures of my fails.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never take a picture of your poops,
do you?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just post the gold on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll fuck something up and post a picture
of it on Instagram just for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to show you that Rasta Jeff fucks up
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some fuck ups recently,
so shit happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next time I make a mistake,
I'll get out the camera and I'll own that
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be like, look, this is my dumbness
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's when I get lazy or busy in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I overflowed a reservoir the other day,
straight into the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only a couple of gallons of water,
but still, when you hear that shit
[SPEAKER_04]: overflow, I was only a few feet away and
had my back turned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just totally focused on what I was
doing and I heard, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just sit there and you feel like a
slow kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, I'm going to have to take the
short bus to work tomorrow after this
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with some people that in the early
days, we were filling res' and took off to
[SPEAKER_03]: lunch and went to the bar, had a couple
beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Came back two and a half hours later and
the water was still running.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys have to swim to the reservoir
to turn to the nozzle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, it was a big old mechanic shop,
just a big steel building with a roll-up
[SPEAKER_03]: door on one side.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was still real early days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was most definitely trap house worthy,
but it was an early legal grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just rolled up the door and it was a
blast back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, you could do all kinds of
dumb shit that you can't do now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to smoke in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had our grow and our dispensary was
attached.
[SPEAKER_04]: One floor was the grow, one floor was the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a camera, of course, with a monitor
up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just look at the monitor and hear
the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be watering plants, smoking a fat
joint, just watering plants, living my
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got reggae on and then you hear the
doorbell and just run downstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't even put out the joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just set it on the counter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, you never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it got hot in that building.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen barefoot and shirtless felons
working in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, felons running them originally.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the signs used to be made on
cardboard with little hippie drawings and
[SPEAKER_04]: colors like my girlfriend did it and shit
because that's how it was done.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing printed on a printer
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no barcode on any weed product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all just grown in someone's
basement or upstairs from the dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: and then trimmed and then brought right
immediately to the grow or to the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary, put in a jar and sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean we had some weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just turned into money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite all that, certain shops still
just, boom, had the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dispensary grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the grow was grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honest, I used to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at Metamar Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend Tom was the owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the manager right underneath him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom handed me the keys one day and he was
like, here, you got a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: He paid me very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at this dispensary and I would
grow cherry widow at home in my own home
[SPEAKER_04]: grow and then I would take that cherry
widow to the shop and sell it to the boss
[SPEAKER_04]: for a decent price, put it on the shelf
and that was the most fire weed we had in
[SPEAKER_04]: there that week.

[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I think that's enough catching
up and humble bragging about what I've
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten to do for the past couple of
weekends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, fish is coming up here on the
next weekend, so you guys will get to hear
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and get into some of the
news articles that I have pulled up for
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have been following the show,
you will remember that recently,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a raid in California of a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the police raided this dispensary,
first of all, they treated all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: people inside of the dispensary like
complete shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were completely disrespectful to a
woman in a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they cleared out the dispensary and
proceeded to destroy this dispensary,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they did not realize that they were on
a hidden camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: As they destroyed the dispensary,
they destroyed displays, they destroyed
[SPEAKER_04]: the security systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just tore this place apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: As they were doing this, they were caught
on camera eating edibles from the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the lawyer for the dispensary found
the tape, edited the tape, and it was put
[SPEAKER_04]: up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all over the internet, but also
they were trying to file a case against
[SPEAKER_04]: the law enforcement officials that were
responsible for this raid and for the
[SPEAKER_04]: eating of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the video was introduced and a court
case was presented, the Santa Ana police
[SPEAKER_04]: tried to stop this footage from being used
in a raid because they were under the
[SPEAKER_04]: presumption of privacy since they had
already taken down all of the cameras in
[SPEAKER_04]: this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, these cops came in, destroyed the
dispensary, they were caught on hidden
[SPEAKER_04]: camera doing shit they should not have
done, and then they tried to block the
[SPEAKER_04]: video from being used as evidence in a
case against them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now I'm reading on the Huffington
Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an article by a guy named Matt
Ferner, and the headline says,
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is great news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and read the
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is from Los Angeles, and it says,
An Orange County Superior Court judge
[SPEAKER_04]: ruled Wednesday that a controversial
surveillance video allegedly showing three
[SPEAKER_04]: police officers eating marijuana-infused
candy and mocking a disabled woman during
[SPEAKER_04]: a May dispensary raid can be used in an
internal investigation by the Santa Ana
[SPEAKER_04]: Police Department.
[SPEAKER_04]: The unidentified officers and their union,
the Santa Ana Police Officers Association,
[SPEAKER_04]: filed a temporary restraining order
earlier this month to block the video from
[SPEAKER_04]: being used in an ongoing internal
investigation for the officers' conduct
[SPEAKER_04]: during the raid.
[SPEAKER_04]: The police argued their privacy was
violated when surveillance cameras
[SPEAKER_04]: recorded them from inside Sky High
Holistic Medical Marijuana Dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: after they thought they had disabled all
of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Superior Court Judge Ronald Bauer rejected
that notion on Wednesday, the Orange
[SPEAKER_04]: County Register first reported,
saying that the officers had no
[SPEAKER_04]: objectively reasonable expectation that
their actions and words during the raid
[SPEAKER_04]: would not be observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The officers should not expect privacy on
their on-duty performance of an official
[SPEAKER_04]: function at a marijuana dispensary,
Bauer ruled.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have made no claim that their work
required secrecy or that it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: impeded by public view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matthew Pappas, the dispensary's attorney,
said the ruling is a critical victory for
[SPEAKER_04]: holding police and public officials
accountable for their actions.
[SPEAKER_04]: This ruling shows that the court had the
courage to say no to a very powerful
[SPEAKER_04]: police officer reunion and stand up for
the rights of people who had bad things
[SPEAKER_04]: like this happen, Pappas told the
Huffington Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pappas released edited footage of the May
27th raid in June that was published by
[SPEAKER_04]: various local news outlets.
[SPEAKER_04]: The edited video, which can be seen on
YouTube, it's also here in this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to see it, go to
thehuffingtonpost.com, type in,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's see, where will you find it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just type in marijuana raid, and I'm sure
you will find this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to find where I was now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The edited video, which can be seen,
shows officers busting down the door and
[SPEAKER_04]: ordering everyone on the ground at
gunpoint, which that's where the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: comedy starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're battering, using a battering ram
to pound in this door, and the funny part
[SPEAKER_04]: is that the business was open.
[SPEAKER_04]: All they had to do was turn the handle and
pull, and they could have gotten in very
[SPEAKER_04]: easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they used a battering ram and
pushed really hard instead of just gently
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says the footage, according to
Pappas, shows police unsuccessfully
[SPEAKER_04]: disabling the shop surveillance cameras,
which go on to record the officers playing
[SPEAKER_04]: darts, eating something which he argues is
marijuana infused food, and making a joke
[SPEAKER_04]: about an amputee who uses a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you punch that one-legged old Bonita,
one officer asks?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to kick her in her fucking
nub, a female officer replies to laughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey Glaive, the attorney representing
the officers and their union, argued that
[SPEAKER_04]: the video was edited to distort the
officer's behavior during the raid.
[SPEAKER_04]: He previously told The Huff Post that at
least one officer voluntarily took and
[SPEAKER_04]: passed a drug test, the results of which
were provided to the SAPD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pappas denied the video was doctored.
[SPEAKER_04]: The full video is more than 12 hours long,
he said, so he released edited versions
[SPEAKER_04]: with subtitles to show what officers were
allegedly saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire video has been made available
to the police department and that they
[SPEAKER_04]: have seen the full unaltered version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and that they have seen the full
unaltered version, Pappas said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky High Holistic has filed a multimillion
dollar lawsuit against the police
[SPEAKER_04]: department, alleging that the officers
used excessive force during the raid.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dispensary is also seeking the return
of its property seized during the raid,
[SPEAKER_04]: which includes marijuana, cannabis infused
edibles, and thousands of dollars in cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hearing regarding the return of the
seized property is scheduled for Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glaive and the SAPD did not immediately
respond to requests for comment following
[SPEAKER_04]: the judge's ruling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like the ruling has been made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, the ruling has been made that the
video will be usable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will research the hearing regarding the
return of the seized property.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, it takes me a minute to write
legibly, but I'd rather take a break and
[SPEAKER_04]: write it so that I remember to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so they will be able to use
this video in court, which is a great
[SPEAKER_04]: thing because if you or I were arrested
and there was a video of whatever we were
[SPEAKER_04]: doing, that video would be used against us
in court.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything we say and or do will be used
against us in a court of law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if we think that we have some
sort of assumption of privacy,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not going to give us any privacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big brother is watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on camera somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just glad that they're gonna use
this video because I think it's fucked up
[SPEAKER_04]: that these cops can act like they're
trying to do something just and useful for
[SPEAKER_04]: us and then just go in and be thugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were gangsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went in there and fucking stole and
destroyed shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were vandals.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to be held accountable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do some research on what
happened to the property.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they get their cannabis back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they get their money back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they get their edibles back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they make that cop pay for the
edible that he bought and ate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I hope they also sue the fuck out
of them for all the wages they've lost and
[SPEAKER_04]: the mental anguish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope this comes back to bite this police
force in their asses.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I've got another article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes from the beautiful city of
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Facebook has been bustling about
the city of Pueblo, Colorado and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read a fact today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say that it's a fact, but I've
seen this in more than one place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen and read that Pueblo,
Colorado now produces the most legal
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis of anywhere on the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We produce more legal cannabis than
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now the new golden triangle here in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would believe that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our rules are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are affordable here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The climate is perfect for growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody is moving here to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody is coming to Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from what I've seen on Facebook and on
the internet here, Pueblo, Colorado has
[SPEAKER_04]: become the new emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: We produce more cannabis than anywhere
else in the world, or at least the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the whole world.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so this news article,
I try that again, because I stumbled.
[SPEAKER_04]: This news article comes from High Country
News and the headline is the Silicon
[SPEAKER_04]: Valley of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Local officials want Pueblo County,
Colorado to be the best place to grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not everyone is high on the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article is written by a guy named
Joel Warner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will read it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is great because it starts
off with a picture of the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lady says, Tammy White,
age 52, shows her son and his friend the
[SPEAKER_04]: product she bought at the spot 420 in
Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_04]: They drove from Florida for the week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tammy, who has chronic back pain from
bone spurs, could buy and smoke pot
[SPEAKER_04]: legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of great pictures in this
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not realize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna scroll through the pictures
right quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are any more from Pueblo,
I will share them with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: A Pueblo resident who moved from Maryland
to work in the industry smokes pot while
[SPEAKER_04]: overlooking the marijuana plants he grows
in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was hired at a greenhouse five days
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a picture of some guy's
mediocre pot grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy's grown some mediocre pot in
his backyard and his backyard's a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I'll keep looking through
these pictures here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this guy's in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, to put his full name,
Bill Rader, age 60, carries his favorite
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana plant outside to soak up the sun
in Pueblo West campground where he has
[SPEAKER_04]: been living for two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rader, a veteran from Missouri who smokes
because he can't take pain pills,
[SPEAKER_04]: is one among many people who have moved to
Pueblo from out of state to take advantage
[SPEAKER_04]: of marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude's living in a mobile home and he
just has pot plants sitting right outside
[SPEAKER_04]: the mobile home here and he lives in a RV
park.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's the open vape rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that guy from the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick Ortiz waters plants at Los Sueños,
an outdoor marijuana farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a dude just watering a bunch of
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some great pictures in this
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big shout out to the photographer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend you guys reading this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great shop of my, or a great
photo of my shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Verna, age 25, the grower at the
spot, 420, turns the lights on in a newly
[SPEAKER_04]: constructed grow showroom where marijuana
will be cultivated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visitors will be able to tour the
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, if you go to highcountrynews.com
and you look at the article, the Silicon
[SPEAKER_04]: Valley of marijuana, there is an actual
photograph of the shop where I work,
[SPEAKER_04]: the grow room in which I work.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my rooms, it is in this article,
so I encourage you to go take a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been rambling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Morley looks out over 30 acres he
owns east of Pueblo, Colorado and imagines
[SPEAKER_04]: the future on this blustery man In the
late afternoon, there's little more than
[SPEAKER_04]: mud and puddles here, bordered by highway
and railroad tracks and flanked by farm
[SPEAKER_04]: buildings and rolling hills, though by the
end of September, if all goes well,
[SPEAKER_04]: he'll be looking at a pungent green
thicket as 14,000 marijuana plants reached
[SPEAKER_04]: their full eight foot height.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of several major outdoor grows
launching this summer in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado, eventuallyächsther 15,000
Morley, aged 55, and dressed in jeans,
[SPEAKER_04]: flannel shirt, and a tiger's baseball cap,
is a major Colorado Springs real estate
[SPEAKER_04]: developer.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a marijuana dispensary opened in one
of his buildings, he realized how
[SPEAKER_04]: lucrative the business could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, he wondered, am I not doing this
myself?
[SPEAKER_04]: If he planted corn on his land,
each acre would require approximately 2.2
[SPEAKER_04]: acre feet of water per year and produce
$768 in annual sales, according to Rachel
[SPEAKER_04]: Zancanella, a Pueblo-based Colorado
developer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the big business of rural weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that's hard to read.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since the local steel industry
collapsed in the 1980s, Pueblo County has
[SPEAKER_04]: been seeking an economic savior.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nearly a third of its population is on
public assistance, and in 2000,
[SPEAKER_04]: the metropolitan area around its eponymous
city had the highest unemployment rate in
[SPEAKER_04]: the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Colorado voters passed Amendment 64
in 2012, paving the way for legalized
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana, the county commissioners saw a
chance for revival.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hired Brian Vicente, the Denver
lawyer who helped write the ballot
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative to craft rules for growing and
selling pot outside cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a result, about 50 entities,
including Marley, are now licensed or
[SPEAKER_04]: conditionally approved to do so in the
county.
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, the biggest opponent of
marijuana reform has been the government,
[SPEAKER_04]: Vicente says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, the tables have turned.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one else in history has taken as
comprehensive look at establishing
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana business laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County's economy, he adds,
has gone through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, this is my town.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived here since I was approximately
15 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've left a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been back, but I've been here for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen this town go from just a small
Poe town.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little Poe Dunk Hick town when I
moved here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it turned into a city and then it
got going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had some things happening and
people were buying houses and moving in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at one point, everything stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like everything fell apart and
everybody went poor here, myself included.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked shit jobs to get myself through,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I grew weed on the side because
it was the only way that I can make ends
[SPEAKER_04]: meet was to grow some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've got this legal cannabis
industry, obviously I am doing great for
[SPEAKER_04]: myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a legal job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go to work and pay taxes now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really helps our whole economy because
the people that were, I'm going to say 22
[SPEAKER_04]: to about 35 around here, there wasn't a
lot for us to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could either work at gas stations or we
could work at a telemarketing place or we
[SPEAKER_04]: could work crap jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with all of the cannabis industry that
has boomed up, myself and all of my
[SPEAKER_04]: friends are living very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of us grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of us trim weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of us are bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine out of 10 of my friends are involved
in the cannabis industry in some way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of us are hungry for anything
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all got everything we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us have to be criminals anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to do anything shady.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to watch our backs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to look over our shoulders.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go to work nine to five or whatever we
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work eight hour, 10 hour days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you come home from work and you
don't have to worry about hustling.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to worry about being a drug
dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to worry about the stupid
shit that comes along with an illegal pot
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great way to revive an
economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get benefits and health insurance and
pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't do that when you're
growing weed in the basement and selling
[SPEAKER_04]: it illegally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not part of the cogs of the
community that make a society work in the
[SPEAKER_04]: eye of that society.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a black market drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though you spend all your money at
all the restaurants and all the stores in
[SPEAKER_04]: town, people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they don't freak out when I walk into
Applebee's and buy dinner for me and all
[SPEAKER_04]: my friends or wherever we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Qdoba and buy the whole crew dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't look at you like dirty drug
dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look at you like, oh, that man has a
job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feels different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to continue on with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, but the area's relationship with
pot means remains ambivalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is after all a place where IRA voters
recalled their state senator over new gun
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some worry that the counties
[SPEAKER_04]: will reap the promised rewards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to the 1970s, Pueblo is known as P.U.
[SPEAKER_04]: Town because of the steel mill,
says Paula McFeeders, co-founder of Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: for Positive Impact, which opposes the
county's pot-friendly laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're getting known for that again
because of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: That group shows up at all this,
let's see, Pueblo for Positive Impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: They show up at all of the city council
meetings and they try to fight back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fight down cannabis and the cannabis
use, but honestly, guys, they don't do any
[SPEAKER_04]: research and they don't know what they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if a few members that do support
cannabis would show up, we could shut
[SPEAKER_04]: these guys up every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately, Mike is the only one that goes to
the meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to ask you guys to come to
city council meetings when they happen on
[SPEAKER_04]: Mondays and help us speak positively about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a hypocrite because I can't make it to
every meeting, but I do go and I do try to
[SPEAKER_04]: voice my opinion when I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm burping, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, the city of Pueblo is sometimes
called the Pittsburgh of the West.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like its steel town sister city back
East, its glory years lie in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call centers, one of the few active
industries, dot its downtown area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County director of economic
development, Chris Marcuson, says that one
[SPEAKER_04]: of his predecessors used to drive
potential business owners down the East
[SPEAKER_04]: side's crumbling streets and pass crack
houses and say enthusiastically,
[SPEAKER_04]: look at these people, they'll work for
anything, hoping that the promise of a
[SPEAKER_04]: cheap labor force would prove
irresistible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amendment 64 gave local governments the
power to decide whether and how to permit
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational pot within their communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pueblo city council, for example,
banned recreational pot shops and grows
[SPEAKER_04]: within city limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reacted similarly when medical
marijuana was legalized in 2000,
[SPEAKER_04]: placing a moratorium on dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Colorado marijuana enforcement
division's 2014 annual report says that
[SPEAKER_04]: 228 local jurisdictions have voted to
prohibit medical and retail marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County, however, rolled out the
welcome mat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana stores don't require a lot of
space, but indoor grow operations can,
[SPEAKER_04]: says Pueblo County Commissioner Terry
Hart, and Pueblo County got hit pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: hard on the recession, so we had a lot of
empty commercial buildings throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: county that realtors were trying
desperately to fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some other pot friendly communities,
the county made marijuana businesses a use
[SPEAKER_04]: by right in industrial and business
districts, meaning they weren't subject to
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes time consuming and arduous
special reviews or approvals by local
[SPEAKER_04]: government.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Pueblo County offered something beyond
cheap real estate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlike Denver, it had an abundance of
available agricultural land, so local
[SPEAKER_04]: officials made marijuana cultivation a use
by right here, right there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Likely the first Colorado County to do so,
according to Vicente and Joan Armstrong,
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County's planning director.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county had also issued pioneering
rules that prohibit hemp grows with male
[SPEAKER_04]: plants from being located within five
miles of existing marijuana grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: This prevents cross-pollination that can
lower the marijuana plant's THC content
[SPEAKER_04]: while increasing THC and hemp,
which can exceed 0.3% under state law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that does make sense, although they
kind of worded this weirdly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell they don't know what they're
talking about, but the city also issued
[SPEAKER_04]: rules saying that you cannot grow hemp
within five miles of a cannabis grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a great thing because like they
say here, it prevents cross-pollination,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we're not too worried about getting
the cannabis into the hemp because we're
[SPEAKER_04]: not growing male plants outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of our growers are pro-growers and
we've gotten rid of the male.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only males you would find would be on
the hemp farms and we don't need the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: farms fucking up the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, even the Pueblo Board of Water
Works, the local utility that leases water
[SPEAKER_04]: for businesses and agricultural use is
trying to accommodate the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year when the Bureau of Reclamation
explicitly prohibited the use of federal
[SPEAKER_04]: water for pot cultivation, water board
employees calculated that they could lease
[SPEAKER_04]: up to 800 acre feet of raw water to
marijuana cultivators without running
[SPEAKER_04]: afoul of the feds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was completely new territory for us
as resources manager, Alan Ward,
[SPEAKER_04]: who notes 92 acre feet of the so-called
marijuana water was already under contract
[SPEAKER_04]: as of this May.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Amendment 64 was first passed,
I didn't put much thought into how it was
[SPEAKER_04]: going to affect my job, but for a few
months, it seemed like it was nearly all I
[SPEAKER_04]: was focused on.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new rules are more than paying for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, the county netted $1.8 million
from licensing fees for pot establishments
[SPEAKER_04]: and marijuana sales taxes, covering the
cost of its virtual marijuana department
[SPEAKER_04]: and boosting its general fund.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since marijuana remains illegal at the
federal level, most banks are still cagey
[SPEAKER_04]: about allowing pot businesses as
customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means county staff have gotten used
to pot owners plopping tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_04]: of dollars in cash on their desks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcuson says charter buses filled with
Wall Street investors have been touring
[SPEAKER_04]: local farmland, and there's talk of
branching Pueblo-grown pot along the lines
[SPEAKER_04]: of Pueblo Green Chili, another celebrated
local crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real estate prices are rising too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Industrial properties have nearly doubled
in price to $50 per square foot just since
[SPEAKER_04]: June of 2014, says local realtor Kendall
Curtis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that the first outdoor grows and
greenhouses are materializing,
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural land prices have doubled up
to $10,000 an acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: All in all, the Southern Colorado Growers
Association, the local marijuana trade
[SPEAKER_04]: organization, claims the industry has
provided 1,300 new jobs and contributed
[SPEAKER_04]: more than $120 million to the local
economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I can list 25 people I know that
have jobs because of this boom in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, and they all work at the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I can list 25 people that are
employed because of this cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, and that is one shop,
and I think there are 14 or 16 shops just
[SPEAKER_04]: in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a lot of people that are
employed because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county is also hoping to attract
marijuana testing labs and processing
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo could be the Silicon Valley of
marijuana, says Marcuson, the county's
[SPEAKER_04]: economic development director.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd prefer that to becoming Napa Valley
to a... Let me try that line again.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd prefer that to becoming a Napa Valley
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be a pothead just to
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that Pueblo County wants to keep
a fairly low profile hasn't appeased the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry's critics though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana hearings are heated.
[SPEAKER_04]: County commissioners have received
threatening phone calls, and growers
[SPEAKER_04]: worries that some zealot with a crop
duster could devastate the outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our commissioners rushed headlong into
this without consulting the county
[SPEAKER_04]: residents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Complaints Pueblo for positive impact
McFeeters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's the head of that
organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: That allowed a glut of marijuana stores
and indoor grows to spring up in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: West, the unincorporated city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I said, they're like 14 shops
out there and you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have armed security guards.
[SPEAKER_04]: People pull into our parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They walk into our store.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a purchase just like they would
at any other store.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a sandwich shop right down the
street.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a saw and tool shop right down the
street.
[SPEAKER_04]: The San Isabel Electric is right across
the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: People pull up in their car.
[SPEAKER_04]: They walk in and they do business.
[SPEAKER_04]: They walk back out to their car and they
drive away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing bad happens at our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you try to do something stupid at our
dispensary, our security guard will walk
[SPEAKER_04]: outside and tell you to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I see you smoking on the premises of
our dispensary, I will tell you to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: hell out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm rude about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't smoke here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you people just drive away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got somebody smoking in the back
while I was headed for my lunch break.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just drove away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't tolerate that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not there to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're there to make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why people are so wrapped up
and not having a dispensary around them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: The growth has come at a steep social
cost, McFeeters and other critics say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana-related crimes, including the
2014 armed robbery of a marijuana shop,
[SPEAKER_04]: have increased, according to undersheriff
J.R.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, local affordable housing
organizations and shelters have been
[SPEAKER_04]: flooded with families who traveled here
hoping to find jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the first four months of 2015 alone,
306 households relocated to Pueblo because
[SPEAKER_04]: of marijuana, says Anne Stadelman,
who directs a nonprofit housing assistance
[SPEAKER_04]: organization called Posada.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not easy to get a good paying job in
the pot industry, Stadelman says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people can't pass the background
checks and other checks needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these people are saying that cannabis
is causing problems because there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: break-in, an armed robbery of a marijuana
shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one incident.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that shit happens at gas stations and
liquor stores once a week around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody says shit about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened to one dispensary and it's
fucking headline news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dismiss your one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many days in a year and so
many dispensaries that this one is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just shit that you expect in
society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they say these 306 households
that relocated to Pueblo because of
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana, we didn't send you an
invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't ask them to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't bring them here without a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is their fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not cannabis' fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to move here without getting a
job first.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to move here without getting
the proper paperwork to work in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They moved here without knowing how to
trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not our fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not cannabis' fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's poor planning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, and the problems could have
repercussions far beyond Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_04]: In February, a local couple filed a
lawsuit in U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: District Court claiming that the pot girl
next door devalued their property.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of two lawsuits aimed at striking
down Colorado's system on the grounds that
[SPEAKER_04]: it conflicts with federal drug laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if the state laws stand, Pat Oglesby,
a tax attorney who studies marijuana at
[SPEAKER_04]: the Center for New Revenue in North
Carolina, isn't sure how much Pueblo's
[SPEAKER_04]: head start in the reefer race will
ultimately pay off.
[SPEAKER_04]: A 2015 report he co-authored concluded
that roughly 20,000 acres of pot would
[SPEAKER_04]: supply the entire U.S.
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they have a plan to really
have a huge amount of supply, while other
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdictions aren't licensing any
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see the county gaining a
short-term advantage and having a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: market share, says Oglesby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether that is an advantage that can be
kept over time, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's saying, let's see, where did he
say that?
[SPEAKER_04]: 20,000 acres of pot would supply the
entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how accurate that is,
you guys, because right now, there is no
[SPEAKER_04]: pot on the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: The street has ran out of weed because
people don't want to go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now in my area, there is usually
weed abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is usually some dank-ass herb on the
streets.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to sack a weed, it's not a
problem to get an ounce for somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: between 150 to 200 bucks for some fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, an ounce of weed is always 200
bucks if you can find a good ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're smoking up all the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that 20,000 acres would
supply the entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market because there are medical patients
that smoke a half ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They turn it into concentrates or edibles
and they'll consume a half ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy may be underestimating this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going by just numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going by numbers that have been
gathered by social scientists or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those numbers are probably not
accurate because people aren't honest when
[SPEAKER_04]: people do polls and surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep reading, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, In the meantime, the tiny town of
Boone, population 339 in Eastern Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: County, seems grateful for the boost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Entrepreneurs Mark Morley and Jeff Aoty,
a food plant developer originally from the
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast, stopped in Boone one afternoon
for lunch after comparing notes on their
[SPEAKER_04]: developing grow operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aoty bought a nearby 500-acre ranch where
he spent $6.6 million installing the first
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 cutting-edge large-scale greenhouses
that will require 150 employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: He already has several boonies,
as he calls them.
[SPEAKER_04]: on his crew, and he's paying some of them
to fix up the town's century-old Veterans
[SPEAKER_04]: of Foreign Wars building, where Morley and
Aoty dine on frozen pizzas and Dos Equis
[SPEAKER_04]: beers at the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there is still a sign on the VFW's
wall declaring a zero tolerance policy for
[SPEAKER_04]: drug use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bartender Edna Rivera doesn't flinch
as the two pot barons brainstorm about
[SPEAKER_04]: recruiting Israeli cannabis researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: As she rightly observes between serving up
rounds of beers, if it makes money,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 93 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming to you on a Thursday evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Celebrate on the podcast, and this is
definitely some news worth celebrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to make my computer cooperate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting to the news article that I
want to read.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great headline.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article comes from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is written by Summer Ballantine,
and the headline says,
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude spent 20 years in prison for
cannabis, and he has been released from
[SPEAKER_04]: prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: This picture of him shows him with a big
ass smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude looks happy to be out of prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wouldn't be?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got a huge article here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just get right into it and make this
podcast get down to business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for the article because my
computer is pissing me off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, Jeff Mazinski sentenced to life
for pot, freed from Missouri prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I spent a third of my life in
prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, he's 62 after serving 20 years of a
life sentence without parole for
[SPEAKER_04]: nonviolent marijuana related convictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article says, From Jefferson City,
Missouri, a man sentenced to life in
[SPEAKER_04]: prison without parole on a marijuana
related charge was freed Tuesday from
[SPEAKER_04]: Missouri prison after being behind bars
for two decades, a period in which the
[SPEAKER_04]: nation's attitudes toward pot have
steadily softened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Family, friends, supporters, and reporters
flocked to meet Jeff Mazinski as he
[SPEAKER_04]: stepped out of the Jefferson City
Correctional Center into a sunny morning
[SPEAKER_04]: wearing a pair of white tennis shoes and a
shirt that read, I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a shirt that says, I'm Jeff and I'm
free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, he says, I spent a third of my
life in prison, said Mazinski,
[SPEAKER_04]: now 62, who was greeted by his infant
great granddaughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a breakfast of steak and eggs with
family, Mazinski said, he planned to spend
[SPEAKER_04]: his post-prison life seeking a job and
advocating for the legalization of
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: He criticized sentencing for some drug
related crimes as unfair and described his
[SPEAKER_04]: time behind bars as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: His release followed years of lobbying by
relatives, lawmakers, and others who
[SPEAKER_04]: argued that the sentence was too stiff and
that marijuana should not be forbidden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mazinski was sentenced in 1996,
the same year California became the first
[SPEAKER_04]: state to legalize marijuana for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical marijuana is now legal in 23
states and recreational marijuana has been
[SPEAKER_04]: legalized in Alaska, Colorado,
Oregon, Washington State, and Washington D
[SPEAKER_04]: .C.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason he's getting out is because the
public clearly has changed its opinion
[SPEAKER_04]: about marijuana and it's just one of many
ways in which that has been reflected in
[SPEAKER_04]: recent years, said Mazinski's attorney,
Dan Vietz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such extreme cases should further fuel
changing perceptions of nonviolent drug
[SPEAKER_04]: crimes, said Michelle Dietsch,
a senior lecturer at the Lyndon V.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Austin at Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long title, geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lyndon V.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Austin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I don't have to say that shit in
my title every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article says, these cases really
become exhibit A in the need for
[SPEAKER_04]: sentencing reform, said Dietsch,
I think that's how you said that,
[SPEAKER_04]: an attorney and expert in criminal justice
policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just last year, the heavily Republican
Missouri legislature passed a law to allow
[SPEAKER_04]: certain people with epilepsy to seek
treatment with the marijuana extract
[SPEAKER_04]: containing little of the chemical that
causes marijuana users to feel high and
[SPEAKER_04]: larger amounts of a chemical called
cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: The patients can include babies,
Vietz said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody saw that coming, he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty radical statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Police said he conspired to sell six
pounds of marijuana to a dealer connected
[SPEAKER_04]: with the Mexican drug cartels.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, the life with no parole
sentence was allowed under a Missouri law
[SPEAKER_04]: for repeat drug offenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mazinski already had two drug convictions,
one for possession and one for sale of
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana in 1984 and another for
possession in 1991.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the only Missouri inmate serving
such a sentence for a nonviolent marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: related offense when democratic governor
Jay Nixon agreed in May to commute his
[SPEAKER_04]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: The commutation allowed Mazinski to argue
for his freedom before a parole board,
[SPEAKER_04]: which granted his request in August.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nixon's actions are a reflection of
political confidence in changing norms
[SPEAKER_04]: around marijuana use, said Cecilia
Klingle, a criminal justice policy expert
[SPEAKER_04]: at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
[SPEAKER_04]: The governor cited Mazinski's nonviolent
record, noting that none of his offenses
[SPEAKER_04]: involved selling drugs to children.
[SPEAKER_04]: The law under which he was originally
sentenced has since been changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other states are reevaluating punishment
for drug possession crimes, motivated in
[SPEAKER_04]: large part by the high cost of imprisoning
low-level nonviolent offenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, imagine how much it costs to
keep this dude in prison for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have sent people to a cost more
money to send people to prison for years
[SPEAKER_04]: than it does to send somebody to college,
is what I recently read.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably could have sent three or four,
he was in there for 20 years, probably
[SPEAKER_04]: could have sent five or 10 people to
college for the cost that it costs to
[SPEAKER_04]: house him and nothing came of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in the long-term, he will affect
people being released.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he did some good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's called a martyr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what he was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he was a martyr.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it was worth it for the movement,
but not for him and not for, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they could have fucking educated some
people for this cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep reading my article here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, in Connecticut, a new law will
make possession of small amounts of hard
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs, including heroin, cocaine,
and crack cocaine, a misdemeanor for a
[SPEAKER_04]: first-time offense rather than allowing
for the current maximum seven-year prison
[SPEAKER_04]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nebraska and Alabama expect to save
hundreds of millions of dollars by using
[SPEAKER_04]: new laws to cut down on the number of
offenders locked up for possessing small
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts of drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Missouri, backers of two ballot
initiatives to legalize pot have
[SPEAKER_04]: permission from the secretary of state to
begin collecting signatures to put the
[SPEAKER_04]: issue before voters in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another petition proposes reducing
sentences for nonviolent drug offenders
[SPEAKER_04]: who are serving time without opportunity
for parole.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's going to help out the
movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're releasing one guy, why aren't
they going to start releasing all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: people who are in jail, anybody that
committed any nonviolent cannabis crime?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they should all just start
releasing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go unlock the cage and let those
dudes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a joint and a hundred bucks and
send them on their way.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have some other good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is article number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes from the cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to give you a little catch-up story
behind this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, let me see if they tell you in
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was recently a bunch of marijuana
products in Colorado that were taken off
[SPEAKER_04]: of the shelves because they were suspected
of having been produced with cannabis that
[SPEAKER_04]: had been sprayed with pesticides that are
banned from the marijuana production laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have what's called the marijuana
enforcement division, and they have made
[SPEAKER_04]: laws in conjunction with the department of
agriculture to regulate the sprays that
[SPEAKER_04]: can be put on these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently, on the first, a bunch of
these edibles and products were taken off
[SPEAKER_04]: of shelves because they were suspected to
have been made with contaminated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that article planned to read to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I opened up my computer today and
went reading for news and seeing what was
[SPEAKER_04]: going on, the cannabis has posted this
article and it says,
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to say that one more time
just to make it clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this article is by David Magoya from
the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found it on the cannabis and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver health officials Wednesday lifted a
day old order to hold hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana infused lozenges and raw
marijuana from two businesses after lab
[SPEAKER_04]: tests showed no trace of unapproved
pesticide listed among their ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: The owners of Mountain High Suckers and
MMJ America each said they had been using
[SPEAKER_04]: old labels that included among their
ingredients a pesticide that today is not
[SPEAKER_04]: approved for marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pesticide spinosad had not been barred
for use when the labels were made,
[SPEAKER_04]: the owners said.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like this was just an unfortunate
labeling issue, said Dan Rowland,
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver spokesman for its office of
marijuana policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for my stumble there.
[SPEAKER_04]: State law requires marijuana companies to
list on their product labels all
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides, contaminants and herbicides
used in the production process.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's enforcement action is the
latest in a series of actions related to
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides used on recreational and
medical marijuana because the drug remains
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_04]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Environmental Protection Agency will not
establish any allowable pesticide uses on
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, no regulated pesticide can be
legally used on marijuana, but state
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture officials have said as long as
its use does not violate a pesticide's
[SPEAKER_04]: label warnings and restrictions,
it can be used.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Monday, Denver warned businesses that
products listing unapproved pesticides
[SPEAKER_04]: should be removed from shelves and
destroyed or returned to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inspectors ordered tests on the product
holds Tuesday after spotting spinosad
[SPEAKER_04]: listed among other ingredients of Mountain
High's lozenges and raw marijuana at MMJ
[SPEAKER_04]: America shop on Arapahoe Street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The test did not detect spinosad,
city officials confirmed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mountain High had been using old labels
from when it purchased marijuana trimming
[SPEAKER_04]: from a grower that had been using
spinosad, Mountain High co-owner Chad
[SPEAKER_04]: Trivel said.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was before the state said it could
not, he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then it wasn't a problem,
Trivel said.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just didn't look back on the labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on there, but the tests were clear,
undetected.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've never had a black mark before.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said news of the city's action brought
calls from as far as Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did we test negative for all
pesticides, we were told by the city that
[SPEAKER_04]: just crossing off the name because we
already had the bags printed was
[SPEAKER_04]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: MMJ owner Jake Salazar, that's what MMJ
owner Jake Salazar said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Officials later told him he needs to
reprint the labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ordered pre-printed bags, 70,000 units
every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time we ordered them, this wasn't a
banned substance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have to throw all of those bags
away and reorder 70,000 more without that
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredient, which we clearly don't use,
Salazar said.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state's list of pesticides approved
for use on marijuana has been in the
[SPEAKER_04]: drafting stage for about 18 months.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state will not say the pesticides are
safe for use on marijuana, only that their
[SPEAKER_04]: use does not violate label restrictions on
how they should be used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some pesticides are so non-toxic that the
EPA does not require them to be registered
[SPEAKER_04]: nor restrict their use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those can be used on marijuana,
but the industry has complained that they
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't potent enough to eradicate the
kinds of pests and mildews that can
[SPEAKER_04]: decimate a crop potentially worth millions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city in the spring held more than
100,000 marijuana plants at 11 grow
[SPEAKER_04]: operations over concerns that unapproved
pesticides had been used on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this article was from David Magoya.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those products did not test for
spinosad.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were using old labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this really sparks a little bit of
question in my mind because I advocate
[SPEAKER_04]: spinosad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like spinosad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used a spinosad recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has me thinking, I need to go in
here and go to the Department of
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture website and figure out why,
or whichever website it is, it may be the
[SPEAKER_04]: MED.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go and figure out why I'm not
allowed to use spinosad because I run a
[SPEAKER_04]: shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run a grow at a shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to find this list of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure where I find this list
of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that the operations manager at
the dispensary has it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ask him for that list.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not at that point yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't need to know that, but I'm sure
the marijuana enforcement division webpage
[SPEAKER_04]: has a list of approved or unapproved
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we got to do is go there and look.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to know why spinosad has
been banned because I use that quite
[SPEAKER_04]: often.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will definitely figure out why because
something that will help prevent this
[SPEAKER_04]: every dispensary will now be required to
train all plant handlers in pesticide
[SPEAKER_04]: management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every dispensary needs on staff,
one person that can train every new
[SPEAKER_04]: employee on pesticide safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be able to train them, you have to
be certified by the Department of
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to take an applicator safety
test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have been required to do that since
I am the lead grower at this spot
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will be studying and taking that
test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I will know a lot of stuff about
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will find out why spinosad is
unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Agriculture
representative actually told me the reason
[SPEAKER_04]: that Eagle 20 is not allowed in commercial
grows, drum roll please, because when it
[SPEAKER_04]: burns, it turns into cyanide.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the guy from the Department of
Agriculture told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had nothing to do with the danger and
toxicity of the chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually because when it turns,
if there's a fire, it turns into cyanide
[SPEAKER_04]: and the fire department doesn't want to
deal with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that rather interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys, I have got one more
news article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is from local news here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes from the beautiful city of
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked a little bit about Pueblo last
time on the last episode, talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: how Colorado and Pueblo in general was
booming with cannabis and Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado may already be the new Emerald
Triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this article says, funding college
scholarships via pot grows proposed in
[SPEAKER_04]: Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the headline says, gosh, excuse my
throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a drink before we even
get into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and then I'm
going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that was a good drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse the throat clearing on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably won't even edit that,
so I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far there's no editing to be done in
this show and I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, I'm getting ready some amnesia
haze from our friends at Colorado's Best
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to take a fat chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys are going to take a dab
with me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening to the show,
get a dab ready, get a bowl ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're at work or something,
sneak your vape pen out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get stoned together on the count of
six, four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take dabs in the middle of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to smoke so much more hash on this
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to get a little tighter
and not be dab the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also helps my throat last longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's amnesia haze from
Colorado's Best Dabs and it makes my head
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking spin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets me amped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me lively.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hypothetically, if I were going to come
home on my lunch break and smoke a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of dabs and need to go back to work all
energized and in the zone, hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would take four dabs of that and I'd be
in the fucking zone when I went back to
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get onto this next news article,
I am going to mention that I am recording
[SPEAKER_04]: this podcast live on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up all my friends on Periscope?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys don't know what Periscope is,
make sure you or don't make sure,
[SPEAKER_04]: but please, I invite you to use your
Android device or your iPhone device or
[SPEAKER_04]: your Apple device and download an app
called Periscope and then look for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm easy to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for me on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually daily, I will do a dab on
Periscope with my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get a chance to ask me a question
and I will rant for several minutes on
[SPEAKER_04]: your question if it gets my brain going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check me out on Periscope, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big shout out to everybody that's
watching on Periscope right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up Nemo Punk?
[SPEAKER_04]: What up El Diablo?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see who else is on there unless
they send a comment or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: but what up to everybody that's on there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you will join me on my next
Periscope video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I randomly decide that I want to
put the podcast on Periscope while I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now it's kind of cool because I
feel like I'm talking to somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somebody, just someone to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of just staring into the computer
over here, I'm looking at my Periscope
[SPEAKER_04]: friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see them, but it feels like
they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another news article up on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a dab and got all fucking ADD and
sidetracked, but shout out to dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the headline, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Funding college scholarships via pot grows
proposed in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sub headline says, Pueblo County
Commissioner Sal Pace says he hopes the
[SPEAKER_04]: measure that would institute a 5% excise
tax on wholesale marijuana transfers will
[SPEAKER_04]: give Pueblo kids a boost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to read this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have mixed opinions on this right now,
but it's by Jesse Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: I of course found it on our favorite news
website, The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I don't bring you all of the
news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I select a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pick and choose what I think is best for
the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't get enough news from me,
I can definitely recommend The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: High quality cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ran by a dude named Ricardo Baca,
who is a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I support that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out if you don't get enough
from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County Commissioner is proposing a
ballot measure for a program to fund
[SPEAKER_04]: college scholarships through a marijuana
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Sal Pace says he hopes the
new measure will give Pueblo kids a boost
[SPEAKER_04]: and help fight college debt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The County Commission is set to vote at
their Monday meeting on whether or not the
[SPEAKER_04]: proposal will be placed on November ballot
elections.
[SPEAKER_04]: The excise tax would be levied when
marijuana is transferred from cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: to a store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pace's office said in a news release
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I read that really weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County's perfect economic and
weather conditions have created a boom of
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational cultivations without yet
generating a tax on these grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beginning in 2017, graduating seniors from
all high schools in Pueblo who attend a
[SPEAKER_04]: public college or university in Pueblo
County will be eligible for scholarships
[SPEAKER_04]: from the proposed program, the release
said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every kid deserves an opportunity to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pace said in a statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County has potential new tax
revenue from a marijuana industry that can
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit the kids of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ballot measure would propose a 5%
excise tax on recreational marijuana grows
[SPEAKER_04]: from Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_04]: It asks that on an annual basis,
no less than 50% of tax revenue be
[SPEAKER_04]: designated for scholarships.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50%?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're doing it for this,
shouldn't 100, where's the other 50 going
[SPEAKER_04]: Sal?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the other 50% going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of the revenue would be used on
community projects like Colorado State
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair's streetscape refurbishment,
medical marijuana academic research,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a feasibility study on the potential
connection of Amtrak Southwest Chief to
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those all sound like feasible options.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those seem like they're worth some
investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The program may be expanded in future
years, depending on revenue, the release
[SPEAKER_04]: said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tyler Henson, president of the Colorado
Cannabis Chamber of Commerce said he hopes
[SPEAKER_04]: the county commission will fully examine
the measure before sending it to the
[SPEAKER_04]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under amendment 64, we gave local
governments the permission to make these
[SPEAKER_04]: excise taxes, he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just caution the county
commissioners to look at how this will
[SPEAKER_04]: affect sales in Pueblo and the surrounding
areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first thing I think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to add 5% more tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tax is already really high in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's approximately 25%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the exact percentage to tell
you the truth, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody on Periscope, maybe Nemo Punk,
if you want to throw up the actual
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage of tax, I'll say that on the
air and I'll give you a shout out also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you guys follow my friend Nemo
Punk 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He posts a lot of great cannabis shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: 17.5% plus the 10% excise tax that already
exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's 27% plus they're going to add
another five, which will make it 32%
[SPEAKER_04]: excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this extra excise tax is just going to
end up falling on the customer in the end,
[SPEAKER_04]: no matter how it works, which is going to
make cannabis tax 32% here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means it's going to be roughly $185
for a quarter of cannabis, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: ridiculous when you can go to the street
and you can get an ounce for that price on
[SPEAKER_04]: the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get an ounce for $200.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get an ounce for $150 on the
street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to turn around and put
everybody back at the black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to ruin it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to squeeze too much blood
out of one turnip, I think is what my
[SPEAKER_04]: grandma used to say, trying to squeeze
blood out of a turnip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what these guys are trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to crash the whole
marijuana thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys, I think that's enough
podcast for this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go see fish this weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I come back on Monday,
I will have a lot of cool shit to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
another episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank all my friends on
Periscope for joining me.

[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to El Diablo.

[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 94 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_04]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming to you on a beautiful Thursday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got done working at the spot
dispensary for the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot as shit today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in the spot testing out the air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done a little bit of construction
and some rebuilding, so we were testing
[SPEAKER_04]: everything out today, putting in some
work, putting in some hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everyone's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are ever in Southern Colorado,
if you're in the Pueblo, Colorado or the
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo West area, please stop by the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop in if you need some cannabis,
if you need some hash, if you need some
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles, if you need some topicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would love to see you at the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the podcast, drop in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them that you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask if I'm there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I am there and I'm not busy,
they may call me from the back and I may
[SPEAKER_04]: come out and shake your hand and say
hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just kind of depends on who's working
and who's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're able to do that, they'll come
get me and I'll come say hi to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I've got a bunch of great stuff to
talk about today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some news articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some stuff like that,
but first I want to talk about my weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I get to see my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys know me, you know that my
favorite band is Phish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to see two Phish shows over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Saturday and Sunday night at the
Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce
[SPEAKER_04]: City, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday was a pretty good show,
but Sunday was a really spectacular show.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did some great songs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did stuff they haven't played in
several years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The band sounded great.
[SPEAKER_04]: The crowd was in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that kind of sucked,
and it didn't suck really, but my favorite
[SPEAKER_04]: song from Phish, I think my favorite song
is called Punch You in the Eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: The middle section of Punch You in the Eye
is a jam that has been labeled The
[SPEAKER_04]: Landlady.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Landlady was written first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Punch You in the Eye was written.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Landlady was dropped into the middle
of Punch You in the Eye as the groove
[SPEAKER_04]: portion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always been played as one piece since
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on Sunday night, they opened with The
Landlady, which is the middle section of
[SPEAKER_04]: my favorite song.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a little disappointing knowing
that I wasn't going to hear my favorite
[SPEAKER_04]: song through the whole weekend,
but it was okay because they made up for
[SPEAKER_04]: it by playing some, like I said,
some old songs that I haven't heard in a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time and stuff that they have not
played in several years.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody here is a Phish fan,
they played Harpua.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means a lot to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a Phish fan, they don't play
Harpua very often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they do play Harpua, it's a
really great thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's enough rambling about the Phish
concert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Phish.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put on a hell of a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the end of the summer tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: They played A Day in the Life by the
Beatles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They played Talking Heads cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: They played After Midnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They played a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to Phish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to everybody I met on the Phish
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to advertise the podcast to a couple
of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to those folks if you're
listening now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also shout out to Danielle for being a
great Phishing companion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great time with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's enough ranting about Phish.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, we got a new comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be two new comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if I read this one or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to head to iTunes right quick
and we will read this comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think we're going to get right
into some news.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's read these comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: This comment comes from Eden 2013,
and this was left August 27th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a good chance I've read this,
but I take a lot of dabs on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a chance I did not read this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, educated and entertained.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, thank you for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate how organized and articulate
you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also love your hippie love attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to the college level
grow lessons you promised for episode 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read that because I remember
reading the college grow lessons I
[SPEAKER_04]: promised.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those won't be on episode 100,
but they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: After one episode 100, I do kind of plan
on kicking up the education level on this
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone kind of the intro level.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've had your introductory courses from
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've been listening to all 90
something episodes, it's time for you to
[SPEAKER_04]: step up your game and we're going to start
learning a little bit more in depth shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: After episode 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to our friend Eden 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: You left a sweet comment and you gave me
five stars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did what you were told.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing fucking cooler than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got another comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes from our friend Ticha from Philly
and it says five stars from Philly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave me five stars.
[SPEAKER_04]: This comment was left September 2nd.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, I've been listening for a while
now and I have some experience with your
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just dropping a message to let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowledge is key.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for teaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're a teacher.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says teacher from Philly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're a teacher.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate any type of teacher.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how it is to be a teacher.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot of work and dedication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to say thank you for noticing
and thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I would love it if you left a
comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
search for grow from your heart,
[SPEAKER_04]: click on it, go to the review section,
give me a five star review, and then type
[SPEAKER_04]: in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will read your comment on a few
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a few news articles I want to
read.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of you guys are out there
smoking some cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you are taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you are hitting the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you are maybe eating some edibles
or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to do, I want to do a dab with
everybody right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not able to take a dab,
if you're listening to this podcast in
[SPEAKER_04]: your cubicle or in the shop or in your
car, and you're unable to take a fat dab
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, then this dab that I'm about to
take is for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're somewhere where you're able to
take a dab, I want you to get a dab ready
[SPEAKER_04]: and I want you to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So start getting it ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the e-nail so I'm already hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: All I got to do is get it ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now I'm getting a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a nice chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I smoking here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am smoking some candy kush, some
shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real nice and amber-y, real clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real, real shatter-y.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to put some of this on the
dabber here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've almost got it ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I want you guys to start heating your
nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: It usually takes somewhere between 10 and
20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you need more time, I'm going to let
you have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of trying to hesitate,
but it's hard to hesitate on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about dab time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting the rig up to my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want everybody listening to take a dab
with me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a big group dab,
and then we're going to read some news.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you cannot take a dab, all of us
that are dabbing are thinking about all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that are at work or wherever
they are on the bus, in a taxi.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in an Uber, you can probably
smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most Uber drivers don't give a shit if you
smoke out their Uber ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in an Uber, you have no
excuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get down on a bull, get down on a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a group dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the count of six, four, five,
six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like about a half gram dab of some Candy
Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very rare when I cough from a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to take like a serious dab or the
water's got to be murky or something's got
[SPEAKER_04]: to go wrong if I'm going to cough from a
dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody got to take a dab with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you weren't able to take a
dab, I hope you're feeling the dab that I
[SPEAKER_04]: just took.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're feeling the love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're feeling the vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you guys for joining
me for a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been talking about some news articles
and I've been rambling for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's open up these news articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for a disclaimer, I know that
earlier in the future, in a past episode,
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that I was going to get more into
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a CBD episode coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a few episodes in the works that
are partial episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking notes and getting shit ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there has been so much news that I
feel it's my responsibility to bring this
[SPEAKER_04]: news to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here comes the first news article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found this article on the cannabis and
it was written by John Murray of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline says Denver social pot use
plans are getting overhauled.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sub headline says the idea isn't dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Backers of the proposal say they will join
talks with city and business leaders to
[SPEAKER_04]: try to work out a compromise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Activists behind a proposed Denver ballot
initiative to allow some marijuana use in
[SPEAKER_04]: bars and other businesses say they will
pull the measure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Denver Post has confirmed their new
goal, crafting a compromise measure.
[SPEAKER_04]: With city and business leaders.
[SPEAKER_04]: The verbal agreement with a group that
includes city attorney Scott Martinez
[SPEAKER_04]: averts a public vote in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: One that might have allowed more extensive
pot consumption in publicly accessible
[SPEAKER_04]: places than city officials and some
business leaders were comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mason Tivert of the marijuana policy
project said fellow backers of the limited
[SPEAKER_04]: social cannabis use initiative plan to
announce the withdrawal Thursday before
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday's expected certification of the
measure for the November 3rd ballot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Activists now will shift to working with
city officials and the state restaurant
[SPEAKER_04]: and lodging associations to work out an
ordinance that they hope will be
[SPEAKER_04]: considered by the Denver council or by the
city council, excuse me, within the next
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: The downtown Denver partnership which
represents business interests in that area
[SPEAKER_04]: also plans to take part.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not approaching the withdrawal of
this initiative lightly said Tivert who
[SPEAKER_04]: also was a co-author of Colorado's
marijuana legalizing amendment 64 in 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe that cannabis users deserve the
freedom and let me try that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe that cannabis users deserve the
freedom to congregate and socialize to the
[SPEAKER_04]: same extent as alcohol users.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, I'm gonna interject here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we set up this cannabis system that
we have, the whole model that they modeled
[SPEAKER_04]: it after was to make it like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to regulate it like alcohol
and we're able to go to so many places and
[SPEAKER_04]: drink alcohol all night long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't there a few places for us to go
and take some dabs and smoke some flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: and hang out with our friends?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't always have to be at my house
sitting at the dab table.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be able to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many stoners out there that I
don't know because they're all at their
[SPEAKER_04]: house on their couch taking dabs because
they don't come to my house and sit on my
[SPEAKER_04]: couch and take dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're never gonna meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had a social club, we'd go meet each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way when somebody got tired of
smoking, what am I smoking?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I got tired of smoking candy kush,
I could go trade them my candy kush for
[SPEAKER_04]: some of their OG kush or whatever and just
make them a nice little community,
[SPEAKER_04]: a nice little network.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna keep on with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, they found ready support in the
ballot petitioning process, turning in
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,700 signatures, more than twice as many
as needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Denver police have shut down
private cannabis clubs, the city's
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana policy office this year began
examining as an evolving regulatory need
[SPEAKER_04]: the potential of allowing some social use
of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea came up in council race,
that races last spring with some
[SPEAKER_04]: successful candidates open to the idea in
part because tourists lack places to
[SPEAKER_04]: consume their purchases legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can come to Colorado and if you're not
from here, if you've got an out of state
[SPEAKER_04]: license, you can purchase up to seven
grams of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can purchase up to seven grams of
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can purchase seven grams total in any
combination of edibles, hash, tinctures
[SPEAKER_04]: and topicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you can't do once you've made the
purchase, there's nowhere to fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go to the hotel and smoke
because they don't allow smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go to the park because that's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you know somebody, you just have
all this cannabis that you can't smoke and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not allowed to take it to your home
state to smoke it because it's illegal to
[SPEAKER_04]: travel across state lines with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that this smoking lounge type
of an environment is something that we
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really need.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, but city efforts were in early
stages when Taver and Brian Vicente of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis focused law firm Vicente
Cinderberg, both frustrated with what they
[SPEAKER_04]: saw as inaction began to push for the
initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taver and several people involved in the
[SPEAKER_04]: recent talk say it's too soon to predict
what will result.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sonia Riggs, president and CEO of the
Colorado Restaurant Association expressed
[SPEAKER_04]: adamant opposition on behalf of about half
of the state's restaurants in part based
[SPEAKER_04]: on concerns that insurers might drop
coverage of all restaurants because of
[SPEAKER_04]: liability concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, the Colorado Hotel and Lodging
Association, Metro Denver Lodging Council
[SPEAKER_04]: and Colorado Restaurant Association said
in a statement that they appreciated the
[SPEAKER_04]: activist withdrawal of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our respective industries are committed to
working with the proponents and the city
[SPEAKER_04]: to find a solution that reflects the
interests and concerns of all
[SPEAKER_04]: stakeholders, their statement said.
[SPEAKER_04]: The proposed initiative divided Denver
restaurant and bar owners who would have
[SPEAKER_04]: had the option to allow marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Riggs said Wednesday that she would
approach the discussion with an open mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do understand there's a concern from
their part that they need to have
[SPEAKER_04]: addressed, she said of initiative backers,
just as there's a concern from our side.
[SPEAKER_04]: For their part, city officials say they
can't offer assurances.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also plan to gather input from
neighborhood and community groups on the
[SPEAKER_04]: issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't guarantee an outcome on it,
obviously, but it's something we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at, said Ashley Kilroy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do believe that there's area for a
conversation around this and that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of other considerations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Martina said his office isn't drawing
bright lines, allowing policymakers to
[SPEAKER_04]: consider all options first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to throw down the legal
hammer until there are specific proposals,
[SPEAKER_04]: he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the word proposals is out of the
quotation, so that was confusing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until there are specific proposals,
he said, adding we are all working to find
[SPEAKER_04]: clarity within the law so that people can
operate with certainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: If activists are dissatisfied with the
coming decisions, though, they will have a
[SPEAKER_04]: fallback option, going back to the ballot
on their own next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a presidential election that probably
will have wider turnout than this fall,
[SPEAKER_04]: Tavert sees an even greater change for
passage, but he said a successful
[SPEAKER_04]: compromise with city officials and other
interests has more likely to result in a
[SPEAKER_04]: law that we know the city would be
comfortable with and will not resist and
[SPEAKER_04]: will actually implement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they pulled their ballot, so that they
can rewrite it to where they can actually
[SPEAKER_04]: make it a little bit more fair for the
businesses and for the people who want to
[SPEAKER_04]: consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the law or the proposal is not dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to rewrite it and they're
going to try again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like the city of Denver wants to
work with the cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like they understand the revenue
that is available.
[SPEAKER_04]: They understand the need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they mentioned in this article that
out of staters don't have anywhere to
[SPEAKER_04]: consume, which is the main problem here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If those out of staters had somewhere to
consume, they would go there, they would
[SPEAKER_04]: consume, and then they're going to get
hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get thirsty and they're
going to need entertainment, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to cause them or not cause them,
but yeah, will cause them to go spend more
[SPEAKER_04]: money and participate in our economy and
be part of our state's cashflow a little
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I'm going to go blow my
nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm catching a little bit of a head cold,
but I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if my voice sounds a little
bit nasally this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am catching a little bit of a head cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to fight it off, but like any
other professional, the show must go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm doing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making the best of it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you guys for tolerating my
little bit of sniffles and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: a nasally voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I've got another news article
here for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is grounds for celebration.
[SPEAKER_04]: This may become a holiday in Colorado if
they continue to do this annually.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article here came from The Cannabis
and it was written by Kristen Wyatt from
[SPEAKER_04]: the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the headline says, get ready for the
one day tax holiday on Colorado weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, guys, I got to take a drink
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll get the show on the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so the sub headline says,
we're thinking there will be huge crowds,
[SPEAKER_04]: says a shop owner about the September 16
break on the hefty Colorado marijuana tax
[SPEAKER_04]: on recreational weed thanks to the Tabor
law.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that sounds confusing to a
lot of people, but taxes are ridiculously
[SPEAKER_04]: high on cannabis here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to have a one day tax free
cannabis day in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado's unusual tax laws forcing the
state to suspend taxes on recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana for one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sales tax break on September 16th will
save $20 off the price of a mid grade
[SPEAKER_04]: ounce of pot in the Denver area,
where ounces this summer sell for about
[SPEAKER_04]: $200 before tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unusual for a state that has many
times rejected sales tax holidays on
[SPEAKER_04]: things like school supplies, clothing,
or any energy efficient appliances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Officials say it could cost the state
three to $4 million in one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are going to lose three to $4
million in taxes in a single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Article goes on to say, at first,
I was in disbelief.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were doing this, said Sherry Hackett,
who owns Botanicare, a dispensary in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver suburb of North Glen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, that's Botanicare,
not Botanicare, the nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two separate businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once our lawyer said, no, we really are
doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started getting ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're thinking there will be huge crowds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hackett is printing signs to alert
customers to the holiday and is trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: boost inventory for a one day crush of
businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado's taxpayer bill of rights
requires voter approval for new taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2013, a year after legalizing
recreational pot, voters approved the 25%
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes, but the law requires that any new
taxes be waived and refunded if overall
[SPEAKER_04]: state collections exceed projections given
to voters when they approved the new
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the pot taxes were projected
to raise $70 million in 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually raised $58 million,
but because overall tax collections that
[SPEAKER_04]: year exceeded projections, Colorado must
ask voters for permission to keep the
[SPEAKER_04]: money and it comply with the requirement
that the taxes revert to zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lawmakers settled on a short one day tax
waiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: That day is September 16th, one day after
the state's books for the previous fiscal
[SPEAKER_04]: year are made final.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so if you guys want to come to
Colorado and buy a quarter of cannabis at
[SPEAKER_04]: a shop, September 16th would be your day
to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be no taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana won't be completely tax free
that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: A regular 2.9% sales tax still applies as
do medical marijuana taxes and local pot
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so the extra local taxes that
we pay here in Pueblo will still be tacked
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: For pot retailers, the holiday poses a
bizarre supply dilemma.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll want plenty of weed on hand to
sell to throngs of pot shoppers,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if they stock too much product,
they'll forego their one day waiver on the
[SPEAKER_04]: 15% excise tax they pay marijuana
wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_04]: A savvy retailer would want to have
shelves full enough to supply crowds,
[SPEAKER_04]: but bare enough to take maximum advantage
of the restocking without paying excise
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes before the business closes September
16th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Fox, who owns two Denver dispensaries
and also a wholesale pot growing company,
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't decided what sorts of deals to
offer that day, but he's anticipating a
[SPEAKER_04]: windfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our hopes are high and we're going to push
as hard as we can to see as many customers
[SPEAKER_04]: as we can, Fox said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado voters will decide in November
whether to keep the pot taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 2013 taxing measure passed two to one
and state politicians seemed confident
[SPEAKER_04]: voters will reauthorize the taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state constitution requires refunds
only in a new taxes first year,
[SPEAKER_04]: so voters won't be asked again.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I read that a little weird,
so I'm going to read that last line again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says the state constitution requires
refunds only in a new taxes first year,
[SPEAKER_04]: so voters won't be asked again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of read that funny the first time,
but this only comes up when a tax is in
[SPEAKER_04]: its first year, so they won't be asking us
this again.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one day tax break won't put too much
of a dent in the state's overall pot
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado's pot collection are blooming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana tax revenues jumped from 25
million in the first five months of 2014
[SPEAKER_04]: to 44 million in the first five months of
this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: The increase has been attributed to
additional stores opening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado now has 380 recreational pot
dispensaries and 480 licensed recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: pot growers, up from a few dozen in the
state's first months of retail
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, those 480 recreational
growers are actually commercial grows that
[SPEAKER_04]: only vend to dispensaries, recreational
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not include private grows,
so there are a lot more private grows that
[SPEAKER_04]: are not counted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, we made so much tax money
that we have to give our state a tax
[SPEAKER_04]: break.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the customers that come to buy
cannabis on September 16th will not have
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay the regular cannabis tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you come from out of state,
we hope to see you at the spot dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: on September 16th.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you come from out of state,
if you come from anywhere, make sure you
[SPEAKER_04]: ask for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to come out from the back and
say, hi, shake your hand and see what's
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't be at work on September 16th.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't come to say hi to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing Morgan heritage and Damian
Marley and Taurus Riley on September 15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a good chance I will not show
up for work on the 16th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy your tax-free day without me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another news article to read to
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually got a couple more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see how long we've been recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going, 21 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get two news articles and in the
next 10 or 15 minutes, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this article, I've got two articles
that I'm going to read back to back.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one came out on September 8th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next article came out shortly
after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out on September 9th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are related articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and get into the
first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is once again from the cannabis
written by David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline says,
[SPEAKER_04]: The article goes on like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: State and Denver inspectors on Tuesday
ordered a recall of marijuana extracts
[SPEAKER_04]: sold by Mahama concentrates that the
Denver Post revealed contained high levels
[SPEAKER_04]: of unapproved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mahama co-owner Brett Mauser confirmed the
recall of products that were derived from
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana plants grown by a supplier,
treatments unlimited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Treatments co-owner has acknowledged the
Denver company used the unapproved
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Treatments earlier this year had a number
of its plants quarantined by city
[SPEAKER_04]: officials because of pesticides concerns
and later released.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday's recall was ordered by the Denver
department of environmental health and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_04]: Following a story by the post that
revealed lab tests detected three
[SPEAKER_04]: unapproved pesticides in a pair of Mahama
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: The test commissioned by the post found
levels of, oh gosh, myclobutanil and
[SPEAKER_04]: imidacloripid in Mahama's black label
grapefruit diesel wax that were six times
[SPEAKER_04]: the maximum amount allowed by federal
government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Government on any food product.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pesticides also were found in Mahama's
black label alpha blue shatter,
[SPEAKER_04]: but at lower levels, measurable amounts of
avamectin were found in both samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only Mahama product showing an origin
number of 403-00114 on their labels are
[SPEAKER_04]: subject to the recall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was unclear how many products with that
origin number were sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mauser said he is preparing to handle
return products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold placards were placed on locked
storage units for when recalled product
[SPEAKER_04]: comes back into Mahama, he told the post
in an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once product reaches us on this recall,
we will be sending it out for testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once results are back and show passed,
then the product will be released from the
[SPEAKER_04]: city of Denver's hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: If product does not pass, we will be
quarantining and contacting the med for
[SPEAKER_04]: further instruction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday's actions are part of a supply
chain investigation, according to Dan
[SPEAKER_04]: Roland, spokesman for Denver's office of
marijuana policy, adding that additional
[SPEAKER_04]: recalls are possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inspectors visited Mahama's facilities and
poured through records and products.
[SPEAKER_04]: An owner at Treatments, which also
operates Altitude the Dispensary shops in
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver, said he expects agency inspectors
to visit his facility on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pesticides typically are applied while a
plant is growing, not after it has been
[SPEAKER_04]: harvested, dried, and sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: The post investigation found Mahama had
inadvertently mislabeled its products to
[SPEAKER_04]: indicate the concentrate came from plants
it had grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pesticides were not included in the
product's labels list of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: State law requires labels to reflect any
pesticide or herbicide or contaminant that
[SPEAKER_04]: was used at any stage of a marijuana
product's processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Though the law also requires cannabis
businesses to test for pesticides,
[SPEAKER_04]: that provision has not yet been enforced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mouser previously said the business's
labels are only as accurate as the
[SPEAKER_04]: information provided to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going by what our clients give us as
far as an ingredient list, he told the
[SPEAKER_04]: post.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go over the ingredients list and we
check that list again against the approved
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides list.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we find something that isn't on the
list, we notify the processing as a
[SPEAKER_04]: result, there are no safety limits
established for their use specific to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis or their ingestion by consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the products are allowed on other
consumable items such as strawberries,
[SPEAKER_04]: tomatoes, and grapes, though the level of
pesticide residues allowed on each does
[SPEAKER_04]: vary.
[SPEAKER_04]: The post found pesticides levels as much
as six times the highest amount allowed on
[SPEAKER_04]: an edible food product and as high as
1,800 times the level Denver officials
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to be on released plants it had
quarantined earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over pesticide concerns, this plant had
1,800 times the level that Denver allowed
[SPEAKER_04]: to be released.
[SPEAKER_04]: This plant had been sprayed to shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever material they used, these guys
were spraying the fuck out of it all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time and way too concentrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what kind of bugs they were
trying to treat for, but they are not
[SPEAKER_04]: quality farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go on with the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says enforcement of the state's list of
allowable pesticides is sporadic at best
[SPEAKER_04]: with most city and state officials
responding to complaints rather than
[SPEAKER_04]: inspecting each facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado had about five years of medical
marijuana cultivation and sales before the
[SPEAKER_04]: state in 2013 began compiling a list of
which pesticides could be used on the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Officials admit that reflects an imperfect
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado's marijuana czar, Andrew
Friedman, said the state is dealing with
[SPEAKER_04]: the problem as best it can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many growers are new to regulated
pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond that, like banking, the pesticide
regulatory system is heavily built on
[SPEAKER_04]: federal involvement, said Friedman,
director of Governor John Hickenlooper's
[SPEAKER_04]: Office of Marijuana Coordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's not a completely satisfying
answer and honestly, I wish we had these
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges solved by day one, but we're
working toward an enforceable solution
[SPEAKER_04]: that also protects consumers from other
contaminants such as molds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, they are trying to keep the
cannabis safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're testing it now to find out what is
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are figuring out what pesticides we
should and should not be using.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are setting levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are trying to keep the consumer safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have taken this out of the basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have put it into the store and now
we're putting it into laboratories.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope this shows that Colorado is doing
our best to make a legitimate business out
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't just weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a product.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a commercial product that's being
tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am impressed, but at the same time,
I'm bummed out that there are well-known
[SPEAKER_04]: companies like Mahatma that are still
screwing it up and mislabeling and making
[SPEAKER_04]: mistakes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mahatma has won cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done business with Mahatma and
they've always been super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little disappointing to see an
industry leader come out and make a
[SPEAKER_04]: mistake like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will get it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll get their shit together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like they said, they were only going
by the labels that they were given by the
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was probably not their fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go ahead and give them the
benefit of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mahatma didn't do this on purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just going off of labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this next article is completely related
to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this testing and pesticide
testing and safety inspections have all
[SPEAKER_04]: stemmed from a few small incidents,
but it has sparked a lot of investigation
[SPEAKER_04]: and it is going to improve our industry,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to read another article that
came out the day after the last article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one says,
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is pretty much a follow-up of the
last article I read.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is again by David Magoya and Ricardo
Baca.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado agriculture officials have opened
an investigation into a marijuana grow
[SPEAKER_04]: operation named in a report by the Denver
Post about pesticide residues and they
[SPEAKER_04]: confirmed a second business named in the
story was already under scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is unclear which of the two companies
Mahatma concentrates or Treatments
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlimited, both in Denver, was already
under scrutiny and officials with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Department of Agriculture would
not elaborate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the agency said investigations into
other businesses used of pesticides is the
[SPEAKER_04]: focus of its probe.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CDA has one ongoing investigation with
one of the growers and based on the
[SPEAKER_04]: information supplied in the article,
We have opened a second investigation into
[SPEAKER_04]: the other named grower to determine if
their pesticide use is in compliance with
[SPEAKER_04]: the Colorado Pesticide Applicators Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CDA spokeswoman Christy Lightcap said
in an email,
[SPEAKER_04]: Although laws require marijuana businesses
to test for pesticide residues,
[SPEAKER_04]: that rule has not been enforced because
only one facility is certified to do that
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
rules show marijuana that tests positive
[SPEAKER_04]: for unapproved pesticides and other
contaminants must be destroyed or
[SPEAKER_04]: decontaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I don't know how to
decontaminate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't really wash it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think your option is to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Post on Tuesday reported that two of
eight lab tests it commissioned on
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana extracts found three unapproved
pesticides and products made by Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Mahatma labels indicated the
tainted marijuana used to make these
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts came from its own grow facility,
documents showed the cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_04]: came from Treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Treatments co-owner admitted that the
company had used products that contained
[SPEAKER_04]: the unapproved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Treatments, which operates a pair of
Altitude the dispensary shops in Denver,
[SPEAKER_04]: was one of 11 marijuana growers to have
about 100,000 plants quarantined earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: this year by Denver health officials over
pesticide concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city allowed most of the plants back
into commerce, including those grown by
[SPEAKER_04]: Treatments when levels of pesticide
residues dropped to the lowest amount
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed on food crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two other businesses destroyed the plants
rather than wait for pesticide test
[SPEAKER_04]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: CDA's announcement on Wednesday came a day
after the Denver Department of
[SPEAKER_04]: Environmental Health issued a broad recall
of Mahatma products following a visit to
[SPEAKER_04]: that shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inspectors were expected to be at
Treatments Growing Warehouse on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Retailers with recalled products were
instructed to remove them from store
[SPEAKER_04]: shelves and either destroy the products in
compliance with MED regulations or return
[SPEAKER_04]: the products to the manufacturer,
said Dan Rowland, spokesman for the
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver's Office of Marijuana Policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Consumers should either destroy any
recalled product they have or return it to
[SPEAKER_04]: the store of purchase, Rowland said.
[SPEAKER_04]: This information of potential pesticide
misuse is concerning, LightCap said in an
[SPEAKER_04]: announcing investigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CDA has identified a list of products
that can be used on marijuana and has been
[SPEAKER_04]: available to growers for well over one
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pesticides on marijuana is a controversial
topic because no science exists to say
[SPEAKER_04]: which products are safe for consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although several pesticides are approved,
for use on some fruit and vegetable crops,
[SPEAKER_04]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Environmental Protection Agency cannot say
whether they are safe on marijuana because
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant is illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_04]: CDA has compiled a list of pesticides,
some of them so non-toxic that they do not
[SPEAKER_04]: require federal registration, that can be
used on marijuana based on their label
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions, not on their safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a violation of federal law to use
any pesticide contrary to its label
[SPEAKER_04]: directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: CDA has chosen those products whose label
restrictions were so broad that using them
[SPEAKER_04]: on marijuana would not be in violation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But CDA officials have constantly said
they do not recommend using pesticides on
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana, nor will they say those
products that appear on its list of
[SPEAKER_04]: approved pesticides are safe to consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in a completely new business here
and we're building a space shuttle that
[SPEAKER_04]: has not been done anywhere else,
Colorado Agricultural Commissioner Don
[SPEAKER_04]: Brown said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other states, including New Hampshire,
have restricted pesticides allowed on
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana only to those so non-toxic that
federal registration is not required.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado nearly did the same, but the
industry argued that non-toxic pesticides,
[SPEAKER_04]: mainly organics such as neem, cinnamon,
and peppermint oils, weren't nearly strong
[SPEAKER_04]: enough to combat effectively the pests and
mildews that most commonly attack their
[SPEAKER_04]: crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of torn by pesticides because I
run a commercial grow and we cannot lose a
[SPEAKER_04]: million dollar harvest to bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to do something to keep bugs
off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with this last statement here that
organics such as neem oil, cinnamon,
[SPEAKER_04]: and peppermint oils, and rosemary oil is
something, and cedar oil is also something
[SPEAKER_04]: commonly used, those oils are great as a
preventative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are wonderful on a small scale grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, those types of oils will
end up in your concentrate just like all
[SPEAKER_04]: of these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can taste neem oil in your dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you spray neem oil on your plants early
before flower or just before flower or
[SPEAKER_04]: early into flower, I can taste the neem
oil in your dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently I had some dabs given to me by an
artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted me to sample them and I could
taste the rosemary oil in his concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using essential oils isn't always the
cure, the end all, the preventative,
[SPEAKER_04]: the answer also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you have to use some type of a
pesticide, especially when you're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: clones from other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I find I get the bugs the
most often is when I get a clone as a gift
[SPEAKER_04]: from another grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost always has some kind of a bug on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you get a new clone, that's when I
try to treat with, I use heavy shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on what the clone is and what
bugs I see on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will use some pretty radical
treatment because I cannot risk my mother
[SPEAKER_04]: plants getting spider mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot risk my mother plants getting
broad mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I rely on my mother plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my future.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent years developing those mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If bugs destroyed those, oh, I would be
devastated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do understand the need for a little
bit of a stronger pesticide in a
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that I have recently started
doing, I am studying for a department of
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture pesticide applicator's test.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think anybody that is spraying
pesticides in any type of a garden should
[SPEAKER_04]: have to at least examine this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to pass it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be training new employees on
pesticide safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm required to take this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would encourage anybody who's going to
play with pesticides to take this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will teach you a lot about pesticide
safety to start with, how to handle a
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticide, how to apply a pesticide
safely, what to wear when you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will also teach you what is in
almost everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are very few chemicals that they're
using in all these brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just different brands with
different labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same chemical in almost
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you learn what chemicals kill which
bugs, it makes your job a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I recommend studying up on this
pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to your state's department of
agriculture website and see if there's an
[SPEAKER_04]: applicator test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody who does a job like an
exterminator or something like that has to
[SPEAKER_04]: pass this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's available in your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help you combat your pest problems a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will also keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something I recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do it with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my point with these articles is that we
are not screwing around here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are actually testing products to make
sure that things are safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have stepped up our game.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see a lot of businesses fall
apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of all this new regulation with
pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the growers that think they are
master growers and pro growers are not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to know what to do once they start
getting rid of some of the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to start using an
integrated pest management system with
[SPEAKER_04]: live insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a whole different ball
game pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write that down because that
sounds like a good episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a good episode idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could talk about integrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, now I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could talk about integrated pest
management on a whole other episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm writing a note of that.
IPM.
[SPEAKER_04]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to get Sean over to talk about
organic integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see how long I've been talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've been going for at least
35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: 37 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a long podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys like to listen to about 36
minutes worth of show before you get
[SPEAKER_04]: bored.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is time for me to wrap up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank everybody for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you guys listening to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a little bit of a stuffy nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure my voice is a little bit
nasally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do appreciate you for sticking
through this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening to all the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be back on Monday with another
episode for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting together the CBD episode I've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting together three or four
episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all here in this notebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, now we're going to talk about
integrated pest management in a future
[SPEAKER_04]: episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I say at the end of the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that part about going to iTunes,
going to the iTunes store, search for Girl
[SPEAKER_04]: From Your Heart podcast and give me a five
star rating and type in a review and let
[SPEAKER_04]: me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more people that give the show a
rating and a good review, the more people
[SPEAKER_04]: see the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more people see the show, more people
start growing better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more people that are growing better
cannabis, which means the more quality
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is available, which means weed
will get cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone will be able to smoke cheaper
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all have an abundance of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just share the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go click like on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: More people will see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: More people will listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe one day you'll be somewhere
and somebody will smoke some weed with
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd be like, where'd you learn to
grow this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be like, I listened to that
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'd be like, damn, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everyone will have great weed
because of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running out of breath.
