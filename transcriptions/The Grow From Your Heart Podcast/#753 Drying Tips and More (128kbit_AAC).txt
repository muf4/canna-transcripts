Jeff.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I do want to start
off by thanking everybody for the amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: and overwhelming support for the launch of
the iRiDirect website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that I did recently launch
[SPEAKER_00]: iRiDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, iRiGenetics.com,
there is a tab for the iRiDirect link.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who has ordered,
who has supported, who has sent advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, and tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a brand new setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a brand new web store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on a couple of kinks,
but I think things are going quite
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly for how new and how busy it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got it pretty much under
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be patient while we do work out
some kinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ordered and it took a minute to get
a response or get the details you needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point we've got most of
those kinks worked out, but once again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a new website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a new service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bear with me while we get that
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people have told me that
things are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I only put enough things on there
that I can manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mostly me doing that, so I've got to
be able to manage those orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a busy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only put as much on there as I think I
can fulfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I get done recording,
by the time this comes out, I will be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting restocks on iRiDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been looking for something,
waiting for new shit, go check now at the
[SPEAKER_00]: iRiDirect link.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been rambling enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the next order of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to
joining you at the Dude Grows Growers Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: On July 30th, that is a Saturday,
the event does start at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes until 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a smoking competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will recap quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cup event where growers will
bring their flowers and the attendees will
[SPEAKER_00]: get to consume those flowers and taste
them and judge them and vote on who grew
[SPEAKER_00]: and brought the best flowers to the DGC
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of other great breeders will be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of great members of the DGC and
the iRi army will be there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I do invite you to join us at
the DGC Growers Cup in Fort Collins on
[SPEAKER_00]: July 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to shaking your hand,
smoking a bowl with you, taking a dab with
[SPEAKER_00]: you, giving a fist bump, taking a selfie
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough rambling here at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I had some great emails to
read in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a friend who would
rather remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit this grow is one of my worst
grows in a long time, but with all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: help over the past couple of months,
I feel this is my best grow as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really strong statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is admitting that this is one
of their worst grows in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow is not up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the worst, but they feel it is
their best grow as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, I can imagine how that would
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I've played gigs as a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that gig totally sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't play worth the shit, but I
learned more at that gig where I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: play well than I did at the gigs when I
felt like a rock star and all the music
[SPEAKER_00]: came out super smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it should have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I learned more at those rough
gigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I learned more when the job is
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned more when I make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do shit right, you just learned
that you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make mistakes, you go, well,
I got to reassess and figure some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are details and steps I'm missing or
adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend said that this was their worst
grow, but they feel like it was their best
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are growing inside as a person,
mentally, physically, spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower, they're becoming a better
grower, even though they did have a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: run just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my plants are fucked,
but I am growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mind will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body will age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life will go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you learned something that you
should not do again in this last run,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure you learned something you
should try again in the last run.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are growing with every
grow, it's okay to have some mistakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: to totally ruin a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, just don't do it too many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is growing as a person,
and that is what matters the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I feel like you, and he's saying
me, it says, Rasta Jeff, I feel like you
[SPEAKER_00]: spent as much work on my grow as I did
this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take any credit for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did correspond with you through emails,
but you did all the work, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in there turning the knobs,
picking the leaves, watering the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you feel like I did a
lot of work, but I'm doing the work in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, and then talking to you about what I
do, and it just so happens that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself a lot of credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're realizing that your grow is not
what you want it to be, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing that you are learning from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a person, that is a big growth step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give me too much credit for the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just wanted to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably saved me from quitting
growing or having a breakdown or joining a
[SPEAKER_00]: cult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that's a funny message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of messages from people who
tell me how much I helped their garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much we improved their process,
improved their yield, potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, aroma, enjoyment, but to hear that
our friend has had a terrible crop
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, but is having a good learning
and a good spiritual, mental, emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: building experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing to learn that I'm guiding
somebody, even though they're having one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the worst grows ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my worst, yeah,
in a long time, but they're still feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're making growth, and a lot of
it is because I'm spending time teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That recharges me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like giving me some fresh
nutrients, giving me a dose of recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, you asked to remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will honor that wish, but bro,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fistful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump for the words of
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we don't need to ramble too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, it does not have their name on
it, so we will not include that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it says, okay, my dude, that's how it
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, if you had to, and this one,
if you got kids in the room, cover their
[SPEAKER_00]: ears now, because I'm going to say some
crass shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a fun email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I included it here in the
Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a Monday or a Thursday show?
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got kids in the room,
maybe cover up their ears right now or
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it down or put your AirPods in,
because this one's going to be fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there will be some foul language.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, if you had to,
and this is a game that maybe it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not a socially or
politically correct game, but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all aware of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, marry, kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a quick round of fuck,
marry, kill here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, if you had to either fuck,
marry, kill one of these girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: who would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the only way that this works
out to be appropriate because he has
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are choosing plants, not people,
which is the only reason I chose to read
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were people, we would have thrown
this away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to play that, but it goes
a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, marry, kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: My three options are the moon tower,
prana and morning dew, which means I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose one to fuck, one to marry,
one to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the top of my head, we're
killing prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with the rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that do make this cross of
prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm killing prana right off the
bat is because I ran a dispensation
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I, big up to my buddy,
White Mike, and shout out to Tom also,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Chris Ann, and Tree, the people from
that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were running a dispensary in 2008 and
we grew a mountain of flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had truckloads of flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how much there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were turning it into edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were turning it into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing anything you could possibly
do with a weed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were making it out of flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow was a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow was the parent of prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I smell prana, I smell flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain why I'm so sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of it in my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of it in my retail sales
place, my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of it in my commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not get away from flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere I went, it smelled like flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant grew beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant grew perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't ask for anything more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a beating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took bad VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could handle anything you could throw
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could handle bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out good fat harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would finish early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be done before everybody else,
especially outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herb tasted real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz was real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma was great until it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I woke up and I was like,
all I can fucking smell is flow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to smell flow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had allegedly, a lot of flow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't even talk about how much I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I can't just get,
I mean, I could sell it, but it's got,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going anywhere for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to sit here for a day or two
until I could drive it to where it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weed is just stinking up my house
and all I can smell is flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a shower, I put on clean clothes
in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what I smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: More flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to work at the dispensary where I
work and guess what we're selling all day?
[SPEAKER_00]: More flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get off work from working in the
dispensary and now I've got to go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and take care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what it smells like in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: More flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was done with flow and flow makes up
prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I made prana, I put out a bunch of
the seeds and I made sure that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then guess what I did?
[SPEAKER_00]: I chopped down that flow plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to grow flow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just fucking done with it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smelled it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up next to it, went to bed next to
it, went to work with it, came home to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough for me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one off this, the fuck Mary
kill sheet here, that I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up kill is going to be prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is a great strain, but I'm so sick
of flow and we got to kill one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that gives me two options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the moon tower and morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to fuck one and marry the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, and I got to quit saying
fuck so many times in this podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get taken down or something
by the YouTube here, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose the moon tower for my fucking why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's brand new and shiny and it's
brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand new one that just showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to, we're going to bone
down on the brand new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to marry morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I pick morning dew for marriage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is a cross of a couple of my
favorite strains that have really done a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is kind of what got me
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew is what definitely made sure
we were noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two of my, my heaters,
my bangers, my top sellers, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: popular strains I've ever made put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I marry that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, fuck Mary kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fuck the moon tower,
marry morning dew and kill the Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you enjoyed that question
and the answer, and I hope you enjoy and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate my answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm sick of Prana,
the moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to play with that one
in the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two of my favorites, old trusty put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to marry that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy, um, he started the
message with, okay, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to end it up with,
all right, my dude, thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope you're as high as me when
you get this email and it finds you well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty lit when I got the message,
not quite as lit now, cause we were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely blazed, but not as high as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell by some of the questions you
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep burning
through these emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple more here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to make a super long
Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could tell that my voice is a
little bit dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was, I was outdoors doing some
outdoor things and I was talking quite
[SPEAKER_00]: loud and I feel like I may have done a
little bit of work on the throat here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the voice here, not sounding like the
radio DJ I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to read more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does come from my buddy,
J H.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, J H.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: J H I do troll you and pick on you because
you send me more emails than anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever sent to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like we're dating at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're a funny fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a great personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, keep sending the messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to troll you and pick on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that we're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: J H this message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff and the episode about
moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that if you leave some
phenotypes in too small of a pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you please elaborate on that
statement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then it says is the goal to choose
a pot that will allow for daily waterings
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry backs in mid bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention in the moon tower episode
that some phenotypes will, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They get, they stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave them in too small of a pot,
not only this is not just the moon tower,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is cannabis plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is strain dependent, probably
phenotype dependent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific, but cannabis plants,
if you leave them in too small of a pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do begin to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also could, uh, auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they become root bound in that small
pot, it'll take a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too root bound and they don't
have anywhere for the roots to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting a little bit shaded and
not getting the light that they want,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they will auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go into flower on you just because
they're in survival mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Hey, my feet can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously limited to size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only, the only option now is to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole goal in life as a cannabis plant
is to either pollinate or get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some female plants in there
that aren't living up to their best
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, they're just going to say,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either going to pollinate me or
you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This life sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ending it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not my, my feet are stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting enough air.
[SPEAKER_00]: My toes are cramped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant decides to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some plants will stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave them in too small of a pot,
some will flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave them in too small of a pot
for too long, the reason I said stretch in
[SPEAKER_00]: that episode is because I was thinking
about them in too small of a pot pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: together and the light is not penetrating
the canopy to get down to those lower
[SPEAKER_00]: branches, the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the plants are crushed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just started stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know there's light up there,
but they can't get it down here because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just start going up, hoping that
they can fight for some of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants naturally want to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're apical dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get one main top and the branching
will try to reach up to that and keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we top them, take out that main
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others have the opportunity to
compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the top is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all want to be the new king.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we leave them too close together,
too crowded in, in too small of a pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives them a really good opportunity
to start stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting the light that they
could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you look at people's gardens and you
see super tall, skinny plants that the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches went just out a little bit and
then straight up?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is because the plants were
either pushed way too close together,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were in too small of a pot,
or they just were not getting enough light
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see those small pots and they're
really branchy, stretching up real tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: that should have been flowered sooner or
put into a larger pot, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stretch because they're in too
small of a pot because they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get up to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're too crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're too crowded, the number one
source of everything for our plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put the light over there and put
the plant over here, you'll notice over
[SPEAKER_00]: time that plant leans that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then halfway through the day,
if you just move the light over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: way over there, that plant will start
leaning toward that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow toward the light that is
naturally what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do their best to get to
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow a vertical wall,
then do put the light over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants will grow that way and up
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow, there is more to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say if you've got follow
ups or more, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is already follow ups and more
that I did almost skip and I apologize for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is the goal to choose a pot that
will allow for daily waterings and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: backs in mid bloom?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not always the goal, but that is a
good, not a goal, but a good thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, in my personal grow,
some of the larger pots don't get watered
[SPEAKER_00]: every single day, but that's a personal
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to be able to flood them and
leave for the weekend and come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants aren't dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, I definitely want to
water every morning and I want them dry by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I get back in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, by the time I leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times in a commercial grow,
week six, seven, eight, nine in full
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom, flower, we will water right when we
get there at seven or eight in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: and then water again at six or seven
before we leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know they're not going to be
crunchy again when we get there at seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, eight, seven in the morning again
when we show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of those big plants,
we're running three gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're also pulling 2000 to 3000 gram
wet plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't start judging, talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wet, but imagine how much a 3000
gram wet plant weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, they're four or five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're huge bushy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drink up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water and they're only in a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're watering those once or twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my personal grow, I'm using soil-less
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a soil-less mix with a
bunch of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep that one kind of wet for a
longer time than I do the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I like to, I'll use a bigger
pot than I need to and I'll flood that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucker off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I like to do a lot of stuff on the
weekends and I don't want to interrupt my
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to give them a big fat watering
on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll just take a peek at them over
the weekend and I can tell if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need anything, you can look at
them through the camera, see what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that Monday, they're going to
make it until Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll need some water first thing
Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the bigger pots using soil-less
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in cocoa, I do want that more
rapid, wet and dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another really good example of
some of the differences that I use in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow and a private grow,
a big grow, a small grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bigger grow, I'm definitely using
cocoa, three gallon pots, auto watering
[SPEAKER_00]: system and a small personal grow depending
on where it is or whose it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably three, five or seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, it's threes and fives depending
on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we'll put some sevens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're really limited on plant counts,
we'll just put seven gallon pots and make
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, I'm using soil-less mix and
I'm going, I water on Friday and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: can water again on Monday and then I'll
need one more watering midweek usually
[SPEAKER_00]: with the soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've wrapped up that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if you do have any updates,
questions, corrections, comments or
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns, I would love to hear the info,
the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address, of course, is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy, reach out, send me your grow
questions, send me your constructive
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism, your positive feedback or let
me know if you completely hate something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to make improvements and
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have another message right
here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is this an old myth or real in
your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start a question on
a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when drying cannabis,
still on the branches hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like we have chopped down the
plant, but all of the herb is still on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bush and it's just hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got a cut down plant hanging
upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait until I can snap the stems,
then I cut each branch into small enough
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces so they can be placed in Tupperware
in an attempt to extend the drying period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang them until the stems pop,
then you cut them into smaller sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in a Tupperware container in an
attempt to extend the drying period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening and closing the Tupperware as
needed to control the final drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: then trim everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is this one of those things I
read 15 years ago and have been doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing or is this possibly viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, this is a really good question and
this is basically what I do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we cut down a room full of
3,000 gram plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that again, 3,000 grams wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not pulling down 3,000 gram dried
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking cool, but we're not
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wet plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pulling down somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what room we're working in
and what facility we're working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, it would be somewhere between
one and 500 three gallon pots with 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: gram, 3,000 gram wet plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way that the trim crew could
bang through that in a short, timely
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a week worth of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shucking, bucking,
defoliating, leafing, fanning,
[SPEAKER_00]: fine trimming, fine tuning, a lot of shit
to be done to process all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a very, very similar process to
what you've got going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before harvest, we will go in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day before harvest, we spend the full
day defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull off all those leaves and throw
them right into the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop as fast
as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I said chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's, or there's no scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pluck, pluck, pluck, pluck,
pluck, pull, pull, pull as fast as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get every leaf with a petiole,
anything you can pull off, take it off of
[SPEAKER_00]: there because we're going to cut down the
plants tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut off all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plants are naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had their hair cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow we come in and we chop down every
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang it upside down and we put it in
the drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that drying room, I've got a humidifier
and a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of the room,
maybe I've got multiple dehuie and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifiers battling each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them both on 50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the humidifier cranking out 50%
and the dehumidifier sucking to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays 50% relative humidity in that
room with those two pieces of gear
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly battling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep all your filters clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep everything refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the water in the humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use the dehumidifier water back in
the humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that, but keep the machines
battling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep a good temperature in that
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to balance the temperature in a
commercial grow environment, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, but try to keep it around 60,
65 degrees in there if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go too much higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 is going to work, but you know,
let's stay lower if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put all of the plants hanging in that
room until just like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the branches begin to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bigger plants will take
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the smaller plants will be
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing because I've got so
many plants that I don't want them already
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when shit starts popping and crunching,
I will start throwing it into large stir
[SPEAKER_00]: light bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing you're doing with the
Tupperware containers, but I'm using much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're approximately, I'm holding my arms
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about three feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about three feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 18 inches deep and about 18
inches wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just cut the plants down,
cut them into small pieces, get rid of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the big sticks will get taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about something while this is
in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I let the plants get a little
bit crispier than seems desirable because
[SPEAKER_00]: when I put them in that big of a plant
with all that, that material, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of bud, there's a bunch of stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a bunch of leaf remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put all of that into the container
and seal it, it really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstitutes more than you may anticipate
more than you may assume more than you may
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe let them get a little bit
crispier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may let them get a little bit crispier
than some growers may prefer before I put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into that, into that container,
because I know it's going to re-moisten
[SPEAKER_00]: and reconstitute and it's not going to be
as dry as it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go home for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come back in the next
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have too wet of a product in a
container sealed overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost rather let it dry just a
little bit too much in that room than I
[SPEAKER_00]: would put it in the container a little bit
too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I wanted to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it dry a little bit too much because
I don't want the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather a little bit dry, crispy weed
that I can re-moisten with the trick I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in a moment than I would moldy
weed that's got to get thrown away and
[SPEAKER_00]: never makes it to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if my weed does get too dry,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I fix this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the grow space and I pull a few
leaves off of a growing plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: big fan leaves, and I drop those right in
with the dry weed and I seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the moisture from that leaf will
re-moisten, reconstitute my dried up weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't give it a funky flavor or aroma
because guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using weed to re-moisten the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one trick that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on the same path as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken off most of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let it get crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we throw it into these bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove a lot of the big
stems or do you want to leave a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: big stems at this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really dry, leave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll help re-moisten everything nice
and evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll move all the moisture around real
evenly to those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bottoms will be more wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dries will be drier, of course,
but if it was all real dry, it'll move it
[SPEAKER_00]: around to the moisture is more even in
that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your sticks are super dry,
pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're super wet, pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sticks are dry, put them back in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cut off all the leaves,
hang it upside down, let it get crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it starts popping and going crack on
the stems, we put it into the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we seal it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be Mike's job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike would be the leader of the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and myself would go through after
every break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a break every two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back from the break,
I would get the crew going on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then myself and Mike would go into the dry
and cure room and pop open every
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we would have hundreds of big 32
quart, I forgot the size, like 32 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally forgot how much fits in that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have these big containers,
hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd pop them all open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they need to be open for 10
minutes, they'd slide over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need to be open for the rest of
the day, they slide over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inspect every single bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if they need to stay open,
we'll just leave them open until tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: or we'll close them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're fine, they just get sealed up
and they get marked, don't open anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those bins can sit basically
indefinitely until the trim crew is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're dry enough, if there's still
moisture in there that could cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, you do have to pop those as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say daily, hourly, quarterly,
however you feel is needed for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it gets to that dry state to
where it's not gonna cause any mold
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, it's basically curing in that
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets dry enough to where all I've gotta
do is when the trim crew has time or when
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my workers has time or myself even,
when it's time, we can just pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bin out, set it on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a guy that's really good at
shucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just gets all the sticks out and all
the buds will be in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the sticks will be in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then all the big buds go to one area,
the small buds go to another and those get
[SPEAKER_00]: processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that can happen whenever.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we keep those buds in that
container, in that room where the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment is fighting at 50-50 and the
temperature is right, those buds will stay
[SPEAKER_00]: fine basically forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some sort of expiration
date and they pass their prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never last that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get them dried, cured, trimmed and sold
before that but they basically sit in
[SPEAKER_00]: those containers until the trim crew can
get to them which may be just a few days
[SPEAKER_00]: or it could be several days depending on
how many harvests have come and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: bins are in that harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I should mention,
when I do the big bins, the big bin,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the clock, the big containers,
when I do the bins, I line them with
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher paper before I put the plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the big container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a roll of butcher paper on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much to pull off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I line the bottom of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the buds in there and then I just
gently wrap the paper around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That paper absorbs a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That paper also helps me keep my
containers clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to scrub them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to clean them for the next
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a little buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps keep some of the keif and the
resin off of the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps me keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it does one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flip the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flip the steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the bottom buds on the
bottom the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get moist down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get dry properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use that paper to just rotate the
whole package of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just flip the whole thing over and that
paper kind of contains it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the whole package of buds gets
flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole bundle gets rolled over so I can
get that moisture that was down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those buds properly dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those plants and buds are
appropriately dry, you can just pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: off the stick, pass them to the trim crew,
and they can trim it up whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's a little bit drier, I believe
it's much easier to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have such sticky shit to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have everything sticking to your
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be kind of sticky, but when it's
dry, you can just use your thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even use scissors most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything good around here
that could work as a bud, but if this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant were a bud and I were trimming it,
I'd hold it with one hand and just use my
[SPEAKER_00]: thumbs to knock off the leaves and just
spin it and work my way up and down it,
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking off the crispy leaves with my
thumbs because it should be that dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you are doing everything
basically the way that I would do it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut it down, clean it up, put it in the
bins, keep it kind of sustained until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to trim it, and then when it's time
to trim it, we trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes into more containers that are
more airtight and better sealed so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't get so crispy from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they are transferred to the
dispensaries, which at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no control or no say or no idea
what happens to it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our best in the commercial grow to
keep the buds, the plants, the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the products top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower has a lot of pride in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of work into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to get the best flowers,
but I can't promise that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kept fresh at the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more control over what
happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole nother topic for a
whole nother podcast at a whole nother
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where do we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not one of the things you read 15
years ago that you've been doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that you are doing it basically
the way that I do it in a commercial grow,

process.

unnecessary.
