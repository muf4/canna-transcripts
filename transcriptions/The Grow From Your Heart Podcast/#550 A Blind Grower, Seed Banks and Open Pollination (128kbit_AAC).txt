[SPEAKER_00]: You are getting it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I encouraged you to get the
Patreon going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to everybody who's helped
out Mike's Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the point of the show where I ask
you, what are you smoking on today,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I get my damn hands on,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem like that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been enjoying 710 so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten around to posting about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking like 717 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, don't reveal too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually recording on 715 yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice still sounds raspy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been five days and I dabbed myself
into a throat thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I sound weird on the show,
we're pleasantly, politely blaming 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hydrate properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took way just enough too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a wonderful 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good weekend too,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both doing our own thing so much
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a Jay-Z song.
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason for everything in 2020,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the reason for most of everything
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fade that music out.
[SPEAKER_01]: 710 was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumed a lot of good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't get to go anywhere or see anybody
that's not family, but had fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of different this year, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going out and kind of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being at the booth for 710,
I've usually got a booth at some event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people coming up and saying hi
from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually take a plethora of concentrates
and we dab out with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a bummer not to get to
see everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a sore throat, but I know it's
not cup throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't pass around our own little
stoner plague this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cup cough this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take cup cough just to have a cup
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could be that normal again,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that I would
have seen at an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need a big, what did we
miss?
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed Easter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed St. Patrick's day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed Earth Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed a whole bunch of good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Cinco de Mayo and then summer and
then 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then August is going to be fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get screwed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fish at Dick's this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break my heart, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good part is I've already got
tickets for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part about going to a fish
show is getting the damn tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm set up for when they hopefully get
to go next year.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're set up for Halloween, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a strange fucking year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only getting stranger, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ride ain't over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like you're on a roller coaster
and we're still going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it hasn't tipped over yet,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I feel about that
statement, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a fucking helmet, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hope that we're maybe trying to
make some progress at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put this back on track as a
weed show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Mike is smoking some fucking
Ramble box concentrates over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him consume something a minute ago
and it was a bigger cloud of smoke than
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon, sour, ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we see the concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any left in the jar?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but tip it back cause you're going
to spill it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it back to upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like put it down normal cause
you're going to spill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shot, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want you to spill the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to leak out the joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the turps were starting to flow,
but yeah, they were going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitting us up on YouTube to get a good
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good reminder, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on YouTube also.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are used to us being on
the audio formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're available on Spotify, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple podcasts and of course Stitcher and
many other audio formats, but we are also
[SPEAKER_00]: available on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check us out on YouTube search for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, click subscribe, press on the

[SPEAKER_00]: That way you get a notification every time
I come out and put a new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Mike is with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have more guests in the
future, but join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to find us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am smoking since somebody was polite
enough to ask, I'm smoking garlic Grove
[SPEAKER_00]: live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a four gram jar of the garlic
Grove on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says GMO cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an LOA F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as general so's
garlic and orange soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned before, the thing they lack
to put on the jar here is just a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, just have a fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you open it up, it's like a
pleasant Jack in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you open the jar and Kapow right
in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got me stoned, but talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this concentrate for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way the batter hits for seven
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: C R C concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just looked a little bit at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear it in my voice right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite is always this green dot labs,
alive batter, something about the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: it just rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes big clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always heavily medicated from it
on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say it contains 68.24% THC and
non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that blend, but seems to be working
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount of THC I needed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last episodes, there was a, one of the
messages right at the end was more white
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't want it, that's at Nemo punk
15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got him at just the right night too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on, he's on one tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a good mood too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I needed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hanging out with you and doing
these kinds of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on deck, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: On deck is the seven 10 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the portion of the show where we
give shout outs to the people who support
[SPEAKER_00]: us on Patreon at the seven $10 level or
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them the seven 10 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had some sort of like drum sound
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be the seven 10 club here.
[SPEAKER_00]: More equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just a button.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it in post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll get stoned and forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's move forward and give some
shout outs to the bad motherfuckers who
[SPEAKER_00]: support us on the seven 10 club.

at playing tickets and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this mess clears up, there will
be an irie genetics lemur priest hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good time, but we got to wait
for all this shit to go away and then
[SPEAKER_00]: proper social distancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a rumor that we're thinking
about getting something together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hang out.

[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we are going to answer
listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really interesting first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting to it, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time when somebody sends me a
grow question, I am filled with wisdom and
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I was like, oh shit,
I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to reach out to Mike and
some other people and see if we can come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, thank you so much
for the awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I holding this paper in front of the
camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't want to block myself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff, thank you so much for
the awesome information and for your
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am totally blind and I am currently
teaching myself to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the state of Oklahoma and I have
a medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have smoked marijuana for the majority
of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember what mature plants look
like, but I never had any valuable hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on experience while I could see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm trying to teach myself to grow
blind and I'm using the resources you
[SPEAKER_00]: suggested in the 401st episode of your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that I'm running into
though, and I don't really know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy got further than I ever think I
would if I were blind and trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy has made success here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gotten somewhere that's way further
than I feel like I could have gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much stuff that I'm
automatically go, well, like you just
[SPEAKER_01]: check the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how you look for light leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problem solving all the little pieces in
this is going to get tricky, but like in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fun way, if you like puzzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does have, I've read this message and
he does have somebody that helps him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's blessed with somebody that helps him
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, there are things I'm running
into that I don't really know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky that my wife can see,
and she helps me with what she can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, uh, big, thanks for having an
amazing wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I am dead set on learning to do
this with my own two hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were willing to toss me any advice,
uh, and share your wisdom, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my situation is a unique one,
but I am only, I'm not the only blind
[SPEAKER_00]: person out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dude, that is such a fucking awesome
aspiration goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well thought out plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's ambitious and I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love ambitious stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love people who face adversity and
they're going to be a bad motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thriving with, with a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and bless your wife for helping you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to need a little bit of
coaching to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent like a day and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of spreading this one on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to wrap my head around it and
that's a big question mark right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's so many different things
where my brain's like, well, how are we
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the, as the, as a person who is often
in charge of large commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivations, my main job is to oversee
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of what I'm doing is seeing what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just walk around and look at shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is this room where it needs to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the temperatures, I guess I feel that
part, but I look at meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do the plants look good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the equipment say what it needs to
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the lights doing with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to another room and then I,
and I look at the crew, are the guys doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with them, the gals, are they doing what
they need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Mike doing what he needs to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the computers working properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you guys are running computers in
part of the building or the trimmers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm visually doing 90% of my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so yeah, the reason I wanted to read
this is because I had very minimal useful
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never, I don't have any experience
being blind more about the gross setup
[SPEAKER_01]: before I can even let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we are currently, uh, curing some
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not really participate in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a cheerleader and a smell
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it sounds like the wife has
probably got a decent grasp on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear back from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you're a busy man and you
already have a full plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they signed with their full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say that, but,
uh, we're going to call them inspiring
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking grower will be their new name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't have any, like I said,
any useful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I didn't ask a lot of questions
about what kind of products you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your setup is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that, that was more technical than I
was even ready to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there may be other blind people,
other blind growers, other growers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: losing their site and slowly lost their
site over time that have learned how to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt and adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping they're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to have them listening also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully they're listening then also
hopefully they're able to reach out to us
[SPEAKER_00]: and reach us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my email address is grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: At hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me an email and tell me that
you've got advice and ways to help out a
[SPEAKER_00]: blind grower or somebody who was losing
their site, I would love some advice to
[SPEAKER_00]: help our new friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this is a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and big props to the wife,
but I understand that you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient and do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see you do that,
but I I've never been blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any good advice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put, if you blindfolded me and put
me in the grow room, I would hurt myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm just afraid of without the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And neither of us have had to operate
without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're both so heavily reliant on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, I'm thinking about a couple
of different like nutrient stations that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and some of the different different
caustic cleaner agents or we did talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times and he said that his
biggest issues are mixing and sexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, you, you can do a lot of
that with feel, but when you go to check
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots and you'll know this better than
I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the plant and a plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pull that plug out to, to visually
inspect if there are roots, but if I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: visually inspect, how sensitive are those
to, to touch personally, I never interact
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Can you give them the gently rubbed to
feel how your roots are developing.
That's how it just feels like.
Like I can't Spanish actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you squeeze them sustainability wise
and basically hold them out and block them
[SPEAKER_01]: from really until I go to transplant them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's only to gently set them in
their cup, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coat them with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they handle, can you give them a
gentle, a gentle rub to feel how your
[SPEAKER_01]: roots are developing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, I think a little squeeze
would be okay, but there's some situations
[SPEAKER_00]: that Can you squeeze to tell if the buds
are ripe?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you can in other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an eight week plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I have both run schedules where we
would prefer to check every plant with a
[SPEAKER_01]: scope or a loop and look for amber versus
non-amber versus white versus cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't because we have to harvest
this shit on Wednesday because the next
[SPEAKER_01]: crop goes in on Thursday morning so that
it can be in flower by next Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both know how that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick a nine week strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Setting yourself up for success,
finding a strain that you can hope will be
[SPEAKER_01]: reliant on a timetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of those little
tricks that you and I just can't wrap our
[SPEAKER_01]: heads around yet because we're not used to
thinking with that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm reaching out and asking for
our other, hopefully we've got a blind
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, a blind community that can help
us out and give us some tips and tricks
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing back from not
only our new friend, the blind grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the inspiring grower, but also more
listeners who have got some ideas for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I've never played.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep hearing you say that doesn't sound
right as you go looking for what piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: gear isn't operating correctly because
you've got that fucking musician's ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're so much more sensitive than
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll hear if the AC is not running or
some shit, but you'll catch all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny little pieces of equipment that I
never even hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure that's even more amplified for
somebody who's relying on that sense more
[SPEAKER_01]: than their sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could hear that fucking dehumidifier
leaking all the time and nobody said,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody believed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing was leaking, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filled with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that especially with the wife to
help practice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can a hundred percent figure out how to
do this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move on to a next message
to the next message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can give a more solid answer
to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, let's see,
do they want their names said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their name is Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Miles, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the good message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey bro, love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you too bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And caregiver and a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start off by saying you have made my
skills as a grower sharpen over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stumbled on onto your podcast after
seeing you on the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found us on the dude grow
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the DGC and thanks for
mentioning that I have made you a better
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made your skills sharpen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then I haven't missed a new show and
I've listened to probably 200 podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard a lot of this fucking
terrible voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you're doing for us and to
hone our, trying to hone our skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got Mike too at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a question for you and it would
be great for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Miles, I do apologize that it took me
a minute to get to your message,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here it comes, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for your message on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my reason for writing is seed
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have your own seed banks you
work with and all of these people,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, and then he put a couple,
he listed a few of them seeds here now and
[SPEAKER_00]: dank store are pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recently had a rash of bad seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten them all from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all know who that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, uh, and then he mentions
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if they're coming from,
uh, from Europe, we probably know who they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, I've gotten first from
some, from us breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he mentions a couple of us
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to say their names
because I know some of these people and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that some of them offer great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that some of them offer not so
great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, what is the deal with
quality control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why so many bad seeds out there and what
companies take care of their customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten replacements from some,
but others are anything but friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he lists a company and he says this
company, for example, told me they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: replace freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let me back up and touch on a couple
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you did ask what's the deal with
quality control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on like everything else,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's no standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many breeders are a name on a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click on fucking, I don't want to
single out any website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make up something seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click on this website and then you
find a breeder fucking X and you read a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and you go, that sounds like
awesome description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your only connection between you
and breeder X.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can put popcorn seeds in that fucking
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vendors that sell it vet them good
vendors vet their breeders and don't allow
[SPEAKER_00]: that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you bought from, they carry
everybody on the planet and things I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they, they're not going to send you
popcorn seeds, but there's no quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control on the seeds that go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the, I pack the seeds for irie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders hire other people to pack
the seeds and it's up to that person to
[SPEAKER_00]: select A grade seeds and not give you B or
C grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who packed them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the owner of the company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it one of his flunkies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it his wife?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it somebody that knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, was it somebody that cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about, did they pick fucking
quality seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about each company's own quality
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality control comes on the consumer
end on things like you're going to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet and you're going to say,
you're going to say all of the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blanked out on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say all that shit on the
internet on the correct forms and the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how quality control happens in the
seed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, quality control, why so many bad
seeds out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people can sell you seeds and
never have to face you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my face out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to our booth at an event,
it's going to be probably myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, and one or two other people helping
us out, but it's always going to be me
[SPEAKER_00]: unless I'm talking or doing something,
but I'm at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem with my seeds,
you can politely say, Hey, I had an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sit down and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably get a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a real story, uh,
Mike will probably be there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our faces out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have to put your face out
there, who knows what bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be a seed company called bad
motherfucker seeds at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an ad in the paper as far as
it's a clicky thing on the internet and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know who you're interacting with
or who you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why people are able to get
away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's the deal with quality
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why so many bad seeds, uh,
what companies take care of their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, and this is not advertising
or a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that everybody at seeds here now
.com has been personally selected by James
[SPEAKER_00]: Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Bean knows the maker of all of the
seeds on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to shake his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a meeting with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a lot like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make him a lot of money,
but if he doesn't like you, he will not
[SPEAKER_00]: put you on his website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simply how he works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, I don't like your business,
that business ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about you makes me kind of
uneasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to do business with you and
he'll pass on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be a good breeder to get on
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here now.com after that, everything on the
website is backed by a satisfaction
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem, you contact seeds
here now.com and let them know what went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you will get a
replacement pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If seeds here now.com does not replace an
irie genetics pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of my fucking quality control
customer services.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem with the pack of
seeds, I can afford to lose it more than
[SPEAKER_00]: you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather replace it and make you
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather eat a pack of seeds than eat a
customer, eat my reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the next pack will be good
because there's not going to be too bad
[SPEAKER_00]: packs on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know who takes care of their
company, their service, other customers on
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed breeder level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the vendors that seeds here
now.com has top shelf customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can highly recommend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where are we gotten
replacements from some, but some are
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though, a lot of people will
just send breeders an email saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I bought a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't germinate gimme replacements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell by the wording of the
message, if they're scamming you or if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's real 90% of the time, I can tell by
the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're, they're dealing with a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one company said they don't replace
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to feel about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paid money to be eligible for that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got to buy so many to get the
freebie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a bait and switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to, so yeah, they should
replace that shit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's bunk, wouldn't you stand
behind your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand behind my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does one seed cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: That varies wildly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is your production facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people work for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm giving vague fucking
politician answers right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are not expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, like on a wholesale level at the
level that the vendors are buying seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are not expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, I don't know how, I don't want
to disclose too many, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have signed a paper saying,
I won't tell that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a lot of stuff, you're not
necessarily paying for like, the pro can
[SPEAKER_01]: come over and fix what's wrong in 30
minutes, but like you're not paying him
[SPEAKER_01]: for the 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying him for the 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took him to learn how to do it in 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the same thing with breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not paying for the cost to
produce a single seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying for the time, thought,
energy, effort, work, dedication,
[SPEAKER_01]: love that it took to breed both those
parents, then cross them, then test them,
[SPEAKER_01]: then retest them, then stabilize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then market them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each individual seed is, no, it's not
super pricey to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: People fuck up and produce seeds for free
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those seeds, nobody knows what they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows who they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds were, they're not worth
anything, but I think we got better than
[SPEAKER_01]: those ones that didn't germ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's all perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wraps it up with, so I thought who
would be the best to ask about this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I hope all is good in your life
and keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gee, my friend Miles, I hope I answered
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customer service is all based on the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what the breeder believes
is quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything should come in a pretty
well labeled package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like too much handwritten shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a package for me directly and
it's handwritten, it's because I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: had to package that pack of seeds up for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have a whole sheet of labels
made and I just hand wrote it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it always comes on the folded card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep them super professional,
like good quality packaging, just make it
[SPEAKER_00]: look professional, make it look sharp,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to put shitty seeds in the
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wouldn't plant that, if I wouldn't be
excited to open that, if I bought it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't put it in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep in mind, I know that people,
money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: People fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their time, their energy, their effort,
they're away from their fucking people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're away from their family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're away from the air conditioner,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're away from the air conditioner for
eight hours, 10 hours at a time doing shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to some asshole yell at them
about shit that they're doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really not even their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're giving me that money that they
made for a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to think, fuck,
I busted my ass and got shit out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to think, yeah, what I spent
my money on is fucking doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my quality customer control
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times there's six seeds in a five
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not rare when it comes to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Miles, thank you for the great
message, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions, send me a
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you ready to keep moving?
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly should.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, it's me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently this person, this person,
I feel like I may have read this message
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I read it enough times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it seemed familiar now that I'm
reading this, but it says, I'll try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a teenager in the mid eighties,
I was schooled by three old hippie Vietnam
[SPEAKER_00]: vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to use, they used to pirate
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the national forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shame on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the gopher for two seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they had an Afghan, they ran
exclusively in mile long rows on South
[SPEAKER_00]: Southwest facing slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a great fucking grow so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would sow in a single row of 100 or so
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can visualize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they started showing sex,
we would call every male except the best
[SPEAKER_00]: looking male and give him only a day to
start spewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it would pollinate enough to
ensure enough seeds for the next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was gifted a coffee can full of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 10 years into their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an S10.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not it says, I think that's an S10,
which has been selfed for 10 generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I want to jump in right there before I
lose my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an S10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an F10 open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So F is for filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self would be if we reversed one of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not a selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an F.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going further with a filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was, and who knows what F
generation, what filial generation they
[SPEAKER_00]: started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had a handful of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is presumably because you said every
year they planted a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably from years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They planted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They picked a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took one male and open pollinated
up to 99 other plants and gathered the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an open pollination because who
knows which female those came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plants, but it's an open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same genetics, but that way you
get a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of great phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male has now hit every female
phenotype in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably somewhere between four,
12, 16, maybe 32 different phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: available in that female just because of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that male could possibly pollinate all
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to see what that male does
to all of those females for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did that 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time it happened, the first ones
you planted, that was F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you took those seeds, planted a
hundred, culled all the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one boy, probably, oh,
we're going to say there were 50 girls
[SPEAKER_00]: because they probably culled 50 males.
[SPEAKER_00]: 49 males kept one male got 50 girls left
just because of the math and numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one male pollinated 50 girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you did an F2 open pollination and
you just repeated that F3 open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not self because there was no
selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an actual male used in
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a filial generation moving
forward in an open pollination style,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got multiple females,
which is a really good way to find genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that catches us up a little bit right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them for personal reasons only
until my divorce in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my genetics were mysteriously
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty would say, that's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listener here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, anyway,
my point is I want to find something as
[SPEAKER_00]: close to that as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any suggestions or ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was completely out of the game for 13
years and damn, it's a different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel like Rip Van Winkle sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am forever grateful for you from Apical
Maristem, also known as, they put the real
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read that out loud,
but big shout out to our friend Apical,
[SPEAKER_00]: Atypical Maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I read that wrong the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part of that question there,
looking for genetics like what these old
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies used to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I would recommend look for some pure
Afghan seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably find some pure aphi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pure aphi, some LAOG aphi,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think DNA genetics may be a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are harder to get into the States
than a lot of other brands, but some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that LA Kush, OG Kush, LAOG aphi,
that's the stuff you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going to be anything
like what you were smoking 13 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, but keep chasing that dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the growers fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one thing we smoked that one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking for that P91 for so
long, but I think she's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got that one in their head
that they're still looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: still chasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got mine, dude, and I'm excited,
but I'm always skeptical until I flower
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it looks right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see it in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't know if it's flowered right
or not because I never saw the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got the buds delivered in ounce and
pound packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the fucking flowers
and the plants even look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, unfortunately, a lot of it's been
lost to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's been crossbred, but you never
know because everything's still half or
[SPEAKER_01]: more underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily some of the later States to
come into legalization and activism,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still way behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those old genetics are still
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've still got some of that old shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe somebody's got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some old war vets got some shit from
Afghan that you know, like put it out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the universe that you're looking for this
old Afghan, do some research on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, put it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come to you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how these things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking for this one strain for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said something in the right chat room
and someone's like, I've got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want one of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, huh, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I ended up with one of the
strain that I've been looking for for
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2002, 2001 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to find a clone of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient when the time is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That motherfucker may just fucking land
right in your lap or in your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strange time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful time to be alive,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the only emails that I had
selected for this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we burned right through them
quite quickly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I had a good fucking time hanging
out with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put these off for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got through some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually glad I stepped back because
holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you step up the level of content,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple of shows have been
stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody else enjoyed the shows
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized seed got a lot of notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plant selection got a lot of
notice and the ones in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two episodes were amazing and I
laughed really hard at the air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning episode because I've been
dealing with that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're all kind of, everybody's
heads in the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fuck, it's hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of my social media thinks I'm
psychic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, that's what I was thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, every email I get is,
it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was starting to scout out a place at the
new house where I could put a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately, as soon as it got hot
this summer, it was one of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: was waiting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to see what the airflow in this
house does in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And already I'm like, nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Needs modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice quickly when the heat comes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running as many lights this
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, and it factors into everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember arguing with owners because I
couldn't get them to understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmers can't work in a hundred degree
building for, and be the same level of
[SPEAKER_01]: productive as they are in a 75 degree
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the heat will fuck you quick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we're talking about local weather
shit now, but, uh, we are in the high
[SPEAKER_00]: desert, mid desert area and where we were,
the wind would come by and you could feel
[SPEAKER_00]: the water just leave you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body, like this dry, hot wind would
come by and he'd be like, huh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just took my moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the water would just go out of
your whole body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a gallon of water to replace it
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, I mean, it's not just,
we got high and sort of talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: local weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, this is what the cannabis
world's doing with right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to mitigate those fucking high
temps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, um, a lot,
a lot of people started growing for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time or growing for the first time
in a long time, cause everybody's on
[SPEAKER_01]: lockdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bored as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a massive vegetable garden
going right now and I'm dying to put some
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I fucking love to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got extra clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two or three perfect fucking spots
for him too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a patch of corn where a couple
didn't sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some gaps that I'd love to
fill, but, uh, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta stay legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people where they can
grow outside or they're going to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to grow outside regardless
and got to mitigate that heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, no matter where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a consultation for a good friend
who, uh, shut up bro, who, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: was building a grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it's hot and humid,
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, that's fucking,
that's the story dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot and humid right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get lucky in Colorado because it's,
it's so dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can usually find a way around the,
the water we produce, but fucking dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with that heat and the high desert.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new sun, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, this is not the sun I went to
fucking school under.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the globe is warming or
something.
