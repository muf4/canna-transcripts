[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 324 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode was recorded at Giddyup's
office, also known as the Emotech
[SPEAKER_00]: headquarters, this was a really fun
episode to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm joined by Dab and
Granny, I've got Max from TNT
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates, and of course, we've got
Giddyup from Emotech, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddyup Concentrates, and a whole bunch of
other things that he'll talk about on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the room were a few people that
did not get on the mic, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get mentioned if you don't catch
who they are, it's because they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to be miked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them do speak up throughout the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll catch who they are,
but I think they'll be just fine if they
[SPEAKER_00]: really remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, with all the people in the room,
this podcast gets a little chatty,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to keep the intro short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support my friends at the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's time travel
back to Denver with Dab and Granny,
[SPEAKER_00]: Max from TNT, and Giddyup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, we are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can continue to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background chatter is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here at Emotech in Denver with a
table full of amazing concentrates and a
[SPEAKER_00]: group of amazing folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start off to my left.
[SPEAKER_00]: A repeat offender joining me on the
podcast, the always beautiful Dab and
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the show, honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the one and only Dab and Granny,
the real Dab and Granny, the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: likes to bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have you here all night bullshitting
if you'll let us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to stay here all night
bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for putting this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all your fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at her.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all my boy toys here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny's hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm up at Emotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on a mic since he's talking over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddyup is in the house, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Giddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to be back in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to be back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally back in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been in Denver for like an hour
now, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: I travel a lot these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can never really tell where I'm going to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed up with no shoes and a tank
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been walked in with a half a
sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up, motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No man's land.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kind of friend right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude, thanks for letting us do this
in your amazing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we keep it nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to have the community and the
culture come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being all cold and scientific is just too
much like hospital work, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to have some character around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the decorations on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who painted over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our boy right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Brooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that was who it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to embarrass myself and be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Aaron Brooks with the great
decorations on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a monstery and Aaron Brooks looking
monster grabbing a bumblebee, squeezing
[SPEAKER_00]: some honey out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one over here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this one over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was all done by Royal Stane,
who is a graphic designer for Grassroots.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize that art now that you say
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did the bender right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Daily Planet from Futurama.
[SPEAKER_06]: Up there was done by Scenario.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scenario was a Tech Nines production
manager for nine years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did a lot of art with him and was the guy
that ran the lights at all the Tech Nines
[SPEAKER_06]: concerts.
Dope.
Dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super cool artist, but more of an
electronic artist that is also a tagger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet character in these walls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he did my glow in the dark logo right
up here in our galaxy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my mom added the disco balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disco ball center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to mom for the disco balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those make it all happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys ever get the chance,
drop into Emotech in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know how to find it if you need to
be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there on the other mic, hitting a
blunt right now, staring off into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the space painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just find that, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just find that the space is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your microphone voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Max is on the show, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we call you by your stripper
name?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call him my stripper name.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: TNT.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he don't care as long as you're
shoving money in his precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put so many dollars in his thong
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could call him whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could call him whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own him for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out my premium snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out his premium snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out his Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw some dollars in his thong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm classy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm classy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got that Twitch account where I show
dick at.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's super classy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got one red toenail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like Twitch is a place to show
dick, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: See?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why it's all about how you
brand showing your genitals to random
[SPEAKER_06]: people on the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to my friend
Giddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One night, a long time ago, I was on
Chatterbait.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't Chatterbait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Chatroulette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chatterbait's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Chatroulette and Giddy pops up on
Chatroulette.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude, like back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was growing and extracting out of the
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had like no motherfucking friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was like a double liability for
like breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a grow go and I had an extraction
lab in my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, here, here in Colorado Springs,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I needed human contact.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't have friends come over and hang
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd hop on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like I do Tiny Chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiny Chat was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd smoke with people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like it was so fun to like get out
there with these other guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, anytime you could, you know,
you got you know, you got a friend with
[SPEAKER_06]: character.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever see him on Chatroulette and
you don't see him dick first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen Giddy's dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was fully clothed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was smoking weed with people on the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We both popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicks in our pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dicks in our pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before the days of the Instagram
Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before the Facebook Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when you log in and just be on one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to find other weirdos to hang
out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just randomly find people and you
know, next, fuck this weird guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his dick out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some girl doing some Senate best.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, we're going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will just click.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Asian dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got we got stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rambled on and probably looked at
dicks after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, once I once I hit somebody,
that was my deal on a channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, I speak a little Italian
and I speak a little Spanish.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like that, you can locate by region,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would go on places and I would like
try to have conversations with people in
[SPEAKER_06]: there and like flex on my shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got me giggling over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just giggle all you want, sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny's blushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen granny turn color before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Tri-Lingual Amore.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want me to sing to you in Italian?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got time for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll hit it at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll exit out the show with a nice little
nice little song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody needs to stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure to listen to the whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let us forget that we are owed some
music.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm not responsible for anything your
wife does after I sing in Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silently in the corner there is Kevin,
also known as Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hanging out in the corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moderating us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not responsible and did the arm wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a couple of things we could
touch on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days ago, Giddy teased about you
can't believe what's happening in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's my responsibility to pry that
information out of you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell's happening in Denver?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think I think the secret's kind of
out of the bag now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason and the reason why I didn't
want to touch on it and talk about it too
[SPEAKER_06]: much in my post because I was waiting on
more information to come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit me a little diamond deposit in that
blunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you found it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the larger facilities in the state
in Denver had contacted me and they'd went
[SPEAKER_06]: over their SOPs with diamond production
with fire department.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the fire department, those guys
are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, big shout out to Denver Fire
Department.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys have always been like really
cool to work with considering what we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like they worked with us when it was
sketchy as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of them now companies like
mine and other companies can flourish in
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, much love to Denver Fire
Department.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were here with us when a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But did they get involved because of
something?
[SPEAKER_06]: They got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got involved because somebody had a
jar pop and an ignition on a high
[SPEAKER_06]: saturation in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wait, break that down to normal
people talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people listening are not
extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm talking to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot I'm holding the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell all of us here and we will
understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so from what I understand,
there was the way a lot of people make jar
[SPEAKER_06]: jars of diamonds is jar tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: They put a high saturation of butane in
the jar, set a temperature, put it in and
[SPEAKER_06]: diamonds drop out and you'll have to
separate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it takes a lot of and have a lot more
butane than you ever want to put in an
[SPEAKER_06]: electronic oven.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was kind of one of those things that
we knew was going to be short lived.
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew we knew that wasn't when they got
that tech, that tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That that technique produced the way that
most people entry level start doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're definitely not going to be
allowing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to be allowing pour offs
that reach a certain limit on the if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're So basically, let's say Denver
comes in, show me your SOP, explain we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to go over how you do your diamonds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you pop your lid off of your
extraction device to pour into be it
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure vessel jar, anything that you
have anything about pressure vessels,
[SPEAKER_06]: they are not liking pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will not have pressure vessels in
ovens.
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't have pressure vessels that that
stand for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're not liking what they're seeing
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the pressure vessel market.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are definitely absolutely not liking
jar tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean there's not a way to
skin the cat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, yeah, there's a million.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you know, I'm telling the man who's
like one of the best diamond producers
[SPEAKER_06]: that I even know of is sitting across from
me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to dad his five gram diamond
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it's going to do is go clean out
the riff raff in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to shake things up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to prove for mainly like
what I what I look as the people that I
[SPEAKER_06]: mess with is the guys in the lab is
another hurdle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't adapt and go, then will all
this drive the prices of the concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: up?
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on what the stock is of the
market for some places that people shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you shop at one or two places,
it could happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, if they come into your place
and you buy if you're the type of customer
[SPEAKER_06]: that buys a white label to dispensary in
that dispensary, that vertically
[SPEAKER_06]: integrated dispensary wasn't ready for it,
they may increase the price of what they
[SPEAKER_06]: got because they're going to have to re
go.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these people have a large stock
of diamonds, and it's not a problem that's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to that's going to take them off
their feet long enough to affect that
[SPEAKER_06]: large supply of stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you foresee this happening statewide
instead of just citywide?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know you're going to say
nationwide everywhere, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it is it the standard for the rest of
the country?
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver, what Denver do they all do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we compare this to how people used to
open blast their shatter and have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these explosions and stuff back then?
[SPEAKER_06]: There are definitely some comparisons.
[SPEAKER_06]: While I do believe that the same dangers
exist in both, one is significantly less
[SPEAKER_06]: case in point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, nobody talks about, you know,
jars popping.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, we put thousands, you put
thousands of jars out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: into into the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you do it the right way,
it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, TNT and I had this discussion and he
said, well, the state can come in,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that doesn't fix stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's funny because right
here, right here in this building that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're setting in Mark Rudolph of the
Denver Fire Department.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very classy fellow, smart guy and knows
exactly what we all do.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's actually trained and certified on
multiple hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've trained him on my equipment and he's
a good guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He came in here one day after there was an
accident with an emotech machine in a lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they brought me the video,
you know, what happened here, why was it
[SPEAKER_06]: fell?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we went and did an incident
report on it and filled out like from what
[SPEAKER_06]: we could see was all of the things that
led to the accident, which in that case
[SPEAKER_06]: was a little gross negligence of the
owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: The extractor quit and they sent a female
blood tender that had never been in the
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction lab out to finish someone's
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did not know what she was doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she wasn't certified to run the
machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't work in the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: She had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was trying to be safe and made some
mistakes that caused the vessel's lid to
[SPEAKER_06]: come off and all the butane leaks.
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't shut off the valves.
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't exercise any of the stuff that
you're trained to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the case of a catastrophic failure
for any machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one of the parts of the peer
review.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about you buying peer
reviewed machines, we talk about ASME
[SPEAKER_06]: certifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: What has happened here is a group of
engineers have take, whoa, it's storming.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just lost power for a second,
but we're good on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcasts kept going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcasts don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcasts don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: But did y'all see the glowing horse head
when the lights went out that time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody has gone over that particular
machine or designed a machine to see if
[SPEAKER_06]: there is a functionality, a function,
I'm sorry, function of the machine that
[SPEAKER_06]: would cause a catastrophic failure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of that peer review being done is you
have to have your instruction manual.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have a clear set way of
training.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to have a certification
program for the people that actually run
[SPEAKER_06]: it and put it up on the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with none of that ever being a
placement, that was the first steps into a
[SPEAKER_06]: multi-step problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mark Rudolph said, Giddy, you make
these things idiot-proof and they just
[SPEAKER_06]: keep making better idiots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't supposed to be a joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't supposed to be a joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying I've been talking for 90
seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to let you keep going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody else can hop in so it doesn't
get heavy on my side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have to strike that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you foresee what we're smoking or
is it going to go to?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to have to figure out
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random beeps and devices in your facility
going nuts here, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a million ways to skin the
cat, so they're just going to have to go
[SPEAKER_03]: around using pressure vessels.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the thing is they won't just say
yes, pressure vessels.
[SPEAKER_06]: What it'll take will be a company like
mine getting the peer review in process to
[SPEAKER_06]: get a pressure vessel certified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressure vessels are like the low-hanging
fruit, though, of a precipitation of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a million other ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that's definitely the most
idiot proof.
[SPEAKER_06]: And quick, fast, reputable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can hire someone and train them
how to do it in a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't take a real grasp of
science to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of monkey see, monkey do.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that also in itself has inconsistency
in the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get what he makes right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys can't see what we have on
the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some diamonds here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get what he has as consistent as
he has like barge all in an oven with some
[SPEAKER_06]: three month employees, you know,
because you fired everybody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to see too drastic of a
change in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just going to be enough to shake
up what I see as a bunch of complacent
[SPEAKER_06]: people in the market, happy with
mediocrity that think they got it fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it makes a better product for
the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just as long as it makes a better
product and it advances the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what everything is meant to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need safe facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what there's nothing that
anybody can argue about this being right
[SPEAKER_06]: or wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't come set set across for me and
look me in the eye and tell me that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking jar tech safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have kept it real secretive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into the concentrate making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of I've ignored the tech,
but you guys spilled more of the tech on
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode than I've been able to get
out of people that have been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of new to jar tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds dangerous as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised this is the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, those are the first the first
diamonds I made were jar tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: The early days we were doing pressure
relief valves on jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we first started, that's kind of
the tech finding 15 pound pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: released pressure valves on jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went down like the six pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I just worked my ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just hit and miss, trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was when we were still using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tail end of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we use argon or nitrogen to back
purge, to back pressurize, which is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: way easier because you start off with a
clean solution rather than starting your
[SPEAKER_03]: recrystallization in a dirty solution to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are trying to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that are listening to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just scribbling down their
backspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you just said, trying to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to share any of that
information, you could keep going if you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like how to do any of those steps a little
more in depth or if you'd like to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your tech to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to teach us all about the tech,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can look.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look me up on TNT extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself some follows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll give you what you need for.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure if you really want to make a
change.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would just say purchase your hash
from somebody that knows what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on top of that, man, fucking like
your money is all your power people in
[SPEAKER_06]: this weed industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you vote.
[SPEAKER_06]: Support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Research the people that you're buying
from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making people a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're giving your money to a place you
should feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are all diamonds created equal?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting material too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can make crystals out of shitty ass
crude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll drop you one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll drop you one that I know on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to talk about dropping
diamonds out of crude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, people do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: People drop diamonds out of crude and it's
actually if somebody puts you onto it,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the simplest process in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no difference in anything else we
do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are people doing that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you get as long as you get as
long as you take care of your footprints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your shit is thorough.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the same THCA that you're getting
out of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you were getting out of the most fire
prime cured buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where the connoisseur attitude
has to take a back seat to the designer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, cannabinoid makeups that we're
doing nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is gone beyond.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have taken everything that you love and
separated it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we can do designer mixes on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still a holistic smoking guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like my raw products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like water hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like BHO, but I don't like it over
processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it you don't like rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the bad taste of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I'm in on this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some here you need to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a lot of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the same way for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know I even heard you say the other
day that you're considering making rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: My drop dropped to the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many people had to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I hear what he said?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start doing it all,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't get the fire rosin,
they were like nicotine's rosin that they
[SPEAKER_06]: dropped out of fields out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it was so fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I come across fire rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like rosin enough to take a
chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: To dab it, to not like I do not like the
taste of bad rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not like the burnt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither do I.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the stuff that turns my nails
black.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not like bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have been smoking some badness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking some really good rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's also got to check those vegan
fucks, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You rosin boys out here running around,
acting like shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't stay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixteen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the fifth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not breaking laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said that on a low voice on
that, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to I'm not even going to
edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the rosin I smoke tastes like a
burnt popsicle stick or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everything done.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that shit will burn, I'll smoke it
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like sometimes rosin is like
the the like how people used to look at B
[SPEAKER_03]: .H.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: like it used to be just the trim and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would go to it like that's how some
people look at rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people all the melt and stuff
like that that isn't full melt gets end up
[SPEAKER_03]: in rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are there are some people
that are doing, you know, like squishing
[SPEAKER_03]: the 90 in the 120s, which makes amazing
tasting rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of it's taken out the junk,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we just discovered a tech thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being solved for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate my friends are helping me
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plugged in right down there,
but I don't know if I plugged into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to dab some of your rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk a lot of shit on rosin because it's
funny and because it and because you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: get pissed when we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only reason I talk shit about
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets panties in a wad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets panties in a wad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, in this day and age,
I really don't even like to think that I
[SPEAKER_06]: do that on this game.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you notice, I don't make many rosin
jokes, many more that linger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll pop one out every now and like
creativity strikes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, that's another real topic is
how hateful everybody is on the Internet
[SPEAKER_06]: to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love a good rosin talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets people moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just see something and I'm like,
it's I could call I could say something
[SPEAKER_06]: politically incorrect or I could just
fucking call it rosin ish, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and just tie rosin to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were you just handed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides heaven, how else would you
describe that jar fire?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a got a baller as jar here,
some white almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, white, like champagne
colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, at this point in the
recording, that technical issue I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about caught up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was forced to press pause on the
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to restart the computer while the
computer restarted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got lit up in that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked some dabs of THCA crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked a couple of blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made that place cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we all sat back down in our seats
and we got back down on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is what I captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before technology went haywire on us,
we had a little we had some lightning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Denver is what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of disrupted my recording
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a nice, fat smoke break during
that break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given a dab of some rosin from my
friend Max here at TNT off of this
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain did you give me to dab,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some of the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all rosin is shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me a different kind of stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO dabs, crystals, any type of BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's missing this eye high
that I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever does this to my... When you
smoke, well, I did smoke blunts also,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I noticed it from that rosin dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went right to my eyes, right to the
front of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't get that from BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of cool that I missed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's not that you don't get
it from BHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's people get into the habit of
smoking one type of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you smoke BHO and you go smoke rosin,
it's going to affect you differently
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's just going to work
differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't had it for a while and it's
great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you bounce back and forth,
it's almost like strain, because I hit
[SPEAKER_06]: good rosin, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets me completely different high than
my BHO gets me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I only smoke flour for a while,
then I go smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: The BHO hits me right again to where I'm
at.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just stubbornly stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosin messes me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It puts me to sleep like BHO used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just threw me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've also been smoking these fine
CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This CBD that came from the... Let's talk
about this Oklahoma CBD products from
[SPEAKER_02]: CalMX.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a dab to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's got... Oh, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy up is tasting rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the rosin I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got...
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got several seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's dabbing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big contemplation on how long he
should wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is smoking the candy kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It melts nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carb cap is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you guys are here with us taking
a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a sexy mohawk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mess right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a sexy extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going back in for seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to finish the dab because he is
a grown man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's smacking his lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask him what he thinks
about the rosin here as soon as he's done
[SPEAKER_00]: with his micro cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to cough too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's really smooth actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a coffer man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that burnt popsicle smell
that I'm used to with rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have that taste at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like chem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tasted like... Feel it in the front of
my forehead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now again, do you think that's because
of the starting material?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because of both.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the starting material was good?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the process that they had for making
rosin was done right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is the starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are always like... You always got
to remember the starting material.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they have flower categories in
all these awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys could see Giddy up,
he took the end of that rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He exhaled.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He exhaled.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just relaxed back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's part of the couch now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that corner of the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just become one.
[SPEAKER_00]: His legs are crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like looking like a yogi over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a question for him and I'm trying
to give the man a moment so that he can
[SPEAKER_00]: get his brains back in his head after that
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we just took some dabs of this Calm
Extracts, this Concentrate Smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this done in the first FDA certified
lab?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: CanTech Labs is the first lab to get FDA
approval on all of our shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what makes it even better?
[SPEAKER_06]: What state?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's made in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually one of the reddest states
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got medical marijuana on the ballot
June 26th.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody's listening to Oklahoma,
make sure you go vote yes on 788.
[SPEAKER_06]: 788.
[SPEAKER_06]: We passed hemp in Oklahoma and now we're
doing high CBD hemp and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the only lab I know right now that
will make a product specific blend for
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody and add CBG to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which cannabinoids can you put into that
specific blend?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we want to grill you right after you
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't time it any better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit that rosin like my girlfriend was
watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit was fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got brave grannies here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Max is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's watching me smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all smoked rosin though.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all chilling on the couch.
[SPEAKER_06]: My face is high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming along so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no THC, so no Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as I know, no Delta 8 either.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the one that people would be
curious about because it's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not THC Delta 9, which in a lot of
the states that particular verbiage is in
[SPEAKER_06]: the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a compound that is not that,
you can kind of argue that, well it is
[SPEAKER_06]: THC, but it's not THC Delta 9,
which is what you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I have a question then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any chance that smoking this
would cause someone to have a hot UA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you work for the federal government.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say you work for the federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you smoke this wonderful product.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you will not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to watch that about CBDs,
and that is honestly one of the best
[SPEAKER_06]: questions that you could ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we use Proverde out of Massachusetts to
test all of ours.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have all of our COAs, our SOPs,
the way that we produce our hemp,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have no THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we keep all of our test stores to back
it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, as we were opening this
company, we did test batches with our
[SPEAKER_06]: people that smoked, and we didn't have
people pissing hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have people that smoked other
people's product that didn't smoke any THC
[SPEAKER_06]: that did piss hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of places in Oklahoma right
now, because the CBD market hit there
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy, and they popped up like vape shops
when vape shops popped up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people who are selling
stuff that pisses hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that are using
fraudulent tests, or getting one test done
[SPEAKER_06]: on something and reusing its deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's being set forth right now in
Oklahoma is a means to enforce all of
[SPEAKER_06]: that, just like it happened in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing it like that on the CBD
side, prepping for what we polled at 56%
[SPEAKER_06]: in favor of Bill 788, passing medical
marijuana in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say, who would put
THC in a CBD product?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that they're putting THC in a CBD
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not effectively removing any THC
from the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're not processing everything
right, there can be trace amounts of THC
[SPEAKER_06]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause people jobs,
child support cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to wreck people's lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely will, and it definitely has.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of products out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: My brother didn't make any friends when he
started testing people's product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This came back testing hot for THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get people in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Calm Extracts, KALM Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that's available in all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check out CanTech Labs at
C-A-N-T-E-K-L-A-B-S and get a store
[SPEAKER_06]: locator for our Pure Canisutical line,
the Calm line, this is where the Giddy Up
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD line of smokeable CBD products is
going to be coming from with my particular
[SPEAKER_06]: strain of turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have online batch number
tested so you can check the test scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these cannabis-derived turps that are
going back in, or are they food-grade
[SPEAKER_06]: turps?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis-derived terpenes, no THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on which ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really depends on which ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are actually hemp-derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are other natural plant-derived
terpenes, depending upon which terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profile I want to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I'm really disappointed
about on this packaging is your face is
[SPEAKER_03]: not on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we need that Mohawk
package.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless this is you laying down on the M,
did you model for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: That right there is a house product with
terpenes that the lab has been working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I'm actually on as part owner and
part shareholder, we're going to establish
[SPEAKER_06]: a licensing agreement between me and the
company that brings the Giddy Up CBD line
[SPEAKER_06]: that I've been wanting to debut there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be distributed to our distributors
across the country, and it'll be available
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the same people that produce quantum
CBD water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our waters are in Arowan in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in a lot of stores in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, it's a wide range.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got distributors all over the
country that send out our water.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be perfectly honest, we've given away
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_06]: bottles to get out into the market.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for getting CBD out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people need access to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people need access to actual CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much snake oil and bullshit
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to see somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want dragon's blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want actual CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want every cannabinoid you can get.
[SPEAKER_06]: Us being guys that offer an extract too
that has CBG, which not a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the benefit of CBG?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of benefits to CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without getting too technical into it,
CBG really kind of affects your focus and
[SPEAKER_06]: your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: While CBD is healthy body, CBG apparently
appears to be really healthy mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the one they're saying will help
us with Alzheimer's?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the CBGV is one of the ones
into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBG is also the precursor to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost everything that exists in the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to equate it as stem cells for
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The precursor.
[SPEAKER_06]: You like that, don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Trademark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trademark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you motherfuckers go putting stem
cell shit on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to hear none of you
motherfuckers talking about stem cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag weed stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag weed stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag giddy up stem cells in your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag giddy cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Concentrated giddy cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I like to explain it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so close to just really having such
solid data on isolated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the cool thing about this plant is
when you start mixing these in ratios,
[SPEAKER_06]: I love a 10% CBD to CBG ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said, I don't know about
always, for a long time I've been saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll be able to go into,
I don't know what type of facility it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be, maybe it's similar to a pharmacy in my
mind, and you hand them your little card
[SPEAKER_00]: and your card's got your printout on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this much CBD, this much CBG,
this much THC, this much limonene,
[SPEAKER_00]: this much pineal, and each of us would
just go in and stick out our Slurpee cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and concentrate, would fill up your
Slurpee cup with your exact order.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four grams of the Jeff mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, we're not far from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to that 7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we all would.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the isolation of cannabinoids
is all about, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to make a special mixture
before you go to bed, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a little bit THC, a little CBV.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, let's talk about
medicinally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can isolate true formulas to fight
specific- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To give us desired effects, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because if you look at all the
properties of the different cannabinoids-
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make formulas to help ladies that
are going through breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: or prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's- People with seizures,
people with Alzheimer's, people with brain
[SPEAKER_02]: injuries, people with- But we will be able
to isolate formulas specific to those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Design it, design it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already doing that almost right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the plant does an amazing job of
doing it itself in its natural form,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I mean, we can definitely assist it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all we're doing is just moving stuff
around, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: The cool thing is, and the reason why we
say anything and why you'll hear,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, where you hear people going,
it's the cure for everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why there's some truth to that
is because of the versatility of the
[SPEAKER_06]: effects of the different compounds in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's antiviral.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's anti-fungal.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's anti-tectorate.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's so many different things
that the plant can do that when you start
[SPEAKER_06]: isolating the compounds in the plant and
tracking back their ratios to see what
[SPEAKER_06]: interacts with different people,
and maybe it's something by blood type,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe it's something by genetics that is
identified 50 years from now of working
[SPEAKER_06]: with the plant and isolating the plant,
that we will derive the cures for most of
[SPEAKER_06]: man's sicknesses from this plant and
plants like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that time it takes to do it,
and that's why- And it is- Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you said, and plants like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know different spices have the
same holistic effects that pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you found that out with the apple
cider vinegar, did you not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That apple cider vinegar sped up that
cough so much, it got it out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know the exact science behind
this, and I'm going to sound completely
[SPEAKER_00]: ignorant, but we can do DNA tests on
ourselves now, and we can find markers in
[SPEAKER_00]: our DNA that are going to predict,
hey, you may get Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you may be prone to cancer because of
these genetic markers in your DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a lot of Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't absorb it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the short version of what I
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we'll be able to match up those
genetic markers with our cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll print out, you'll take a little
blood, you'll get your DNA, and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, your DNA is shaped like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which cannabinoids do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which turps do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go, start consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you eat, eat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dab, dab this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to dial it in based on a
printout, and we'll be able to use it all
[SPEAKER_00]: science together.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the future, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's great?
[SPEAKER_06]: All medicine will be that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all so fucking high right now that
this makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes all the sense, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confident.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard Joe Rogan say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it in 50 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's step back and let's get a little
deeper for just a quick second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at what we've done in the last 50
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm of a special part of the generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the last of an analog generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was born into an analog world,
and I became a young adult in a digital
[SPEAKER_06]: age when it showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember my uncles only having physical
toys to play with.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started life with physical toys,
and up until I was a teenager,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then when I was a teenager,
at home video games came out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Computers came out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The world changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you got a pager.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a pager.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the first generation with a kid that
had a pager.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a pager.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents brought home an Amana Radar
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the color TV we brought home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm dating myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I remember our color TV,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: While the time may seem a little off in my
situation, you have to also remember we
[SPEAKER_06]: was poor as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: We was poor, poor growing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember my black and white TV.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was five, we got a color TV,
and it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got color on that thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a special time in human history to
exist and to be born.
[SPEAKER_06]: A time where you go from industrial age
and steam and fossil fuels to literally-
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasting and Instagram Live?
[SPEAKER_06]: Digital, nuclear, fucking worldwide
communication, everybody, is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no lag between the exchange of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not always for the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what, but it is different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of that, it changes our whole
culture, and it changes us as human
[SPEAKER_06]: beings.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at 50 years in the future,
100 years in the future, we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: have so much information that comes to the
human body, that comes to the world that
[SPEAKER_06]: exists around us, the ways to quantify
that data, the things to do with it,
[SPEAKER_06]: stem cells, like cannabis becoming legal
and being isolated as it fits in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should tag the people in this room
with some sort of tag and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, when they die, we got to check out
their lungs and see what all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different concentrates were.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what, I'll say it publicly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been saying that forever,
that we're like the crash test dummies for
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dabbing terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows if we should even be dabbing
terps at the concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dabbing terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we first started dabbing,
titanium nails, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let my mom handle it as she sees fit,
but I'll donate my fucking shit to science
[SPEAKER_06]: to study me as a lifetime fucking smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a daily fucking concentrate smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been a lifetime smoker.
[SPEAKER_06]: My boy Warren Sapp donated his brain to
the NFL science program for concussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put my money where my mouth is,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'll put my body where my mouth
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can have it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it once I'm dead,
and you can have it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have that box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping to like... Ghost out and be
digital.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get there in our lifetime,
bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can me and you be 85 years old and they'd
be like, yo, homie, get your new body.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can download you into a robot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to shoot them into your neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be seven years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like, make me like nine foot tall,
bro, or rockets and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could feel that good, would we even
want to consume cannabis anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be like, nah, I could fly and
shit, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd download strains, homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you smoked weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you smoked weed before?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like... Everything's always better
on weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I could fly already, I'd still
want to fly with some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like how we hijacked your serious
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 15 solid minutes of talking about
concentrates, and now we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hashtag, hashtag, they like it
when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, we take it for granted
that we're sitting at a table with a Darby
[SPEAKER_00]: Home rig, with a Hitman rig, with several
jars of high quality concentrate baller
[SPEAKER_00]: jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, not just little scraper jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just like granny gram jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven grams, four grams, six grams,
and then a couple ounces of flour sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shit going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people listening in your
hometown in Oklahoma that can't have this
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in the middle of
somewhere in Kentucky that can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're from, there are folks with
this... People in Texas would go to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking jail for having this on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the time to be alive too,
is the time going from when this came out
[SPEAKER_03]: to being illegal and being something that
criminals did and stuff like that to
[SPEAKER_03]: everyday mom and pop smoking and everyone
smokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still motherfuckers in jail on
that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out here going to cannabis cups and
there's still motherfuckers in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys just showed up and threw
concentrate on the table like check out
[SPEAKER_00]: what we brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free chin and head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems, no stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is mind blowing that in Texas,
a little bit of weed is a misdemeanor,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a gram of concentrate- Same way in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is a felon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that way in Florida too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same way in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this were Texas and one cop came in
here, there's enough concentrate here to
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck us all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just the concentrate,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you what.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to talk about the Emotech
machines that surround us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see two Obies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you what, there's only one licensed
facility in the state of Oklahoma that
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment like this can even set in for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should be giddy up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people listening have to meet some
sketchy dude in a parking lot at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we're still activists and we're
not just out here trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we still put in the work
because there's a lot of people in America
[SPEAKER_06]: that do not have safe access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I forget, because I am high,
when Jeff said about meeting the shady
[SPEAKER_02]: person in the parking lot, guys,
don't be buying your weed off Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ship?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear, hey, I gave the
person my money and got nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good weed doesn't need to be shipped.
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody that looks like Jerry Krasicki
tries to sell you weed on the internet,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got curly gray hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got curly hair like a goatee.
[SPEAKER_06]: He always got pictures with people's weed
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does somebody have your face up,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, somebody had a fake Rasta Jeff
account trying to sell people weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but luckily enough people knew who I was
where they're like, bro, shut this down
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've got a reputation to where I
always say, I'm not going to sell you weed
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut down 75 accounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're trying to advance the cause,
we're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, poor Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jerry, man, but he would
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Radriefer gets a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: She posts a lot of pictures, so it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she is a fantastic grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of sorry that we even
have to say, don't do this, but don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs deeper than just people faking
people out on the internet, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know people out there that set up entire
companies to knock off somebody on
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody's product and sell it to a
particular state.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, that's why brass knuckles
is getting sued.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it was a bunch of knockoffs?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was a bunch of fucking
knockoffs, man, that were out there going
[SPEAKER_06]: and people tested them and they hit hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have people try to call and sell me from
China brass knuckles pins.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the emails on my computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a factory in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to find some Chinese.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to sell me their straight up pins
and put my oil in it for whoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no doubt in my mind that the guys
at Brass Knuckles, they take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: They love this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: They live this life.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I call the Prop 215 life of
fucking forwarding the plant and the
[SPEAKER_06]: culture at the same time as trying to go
legit, trying to cross over.
[SPEAKER_06]: They test shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They test their oil they use.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't not test your oil at this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to buy it and test it and
find Michael Butanala.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're going to find something in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tested every product that we sold here
in Colorado that I may have tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every product that we sold in Nevada,
test every product that's been sold in
[SPEAKER_06]: Oklahoma City, it's a new facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not operate in California for anybody
other than myself and my immediate
[SPEAKER_06]: surrounding when I go to do runs out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, we're going to get your stuff
in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because 80% of the weed would not pass
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not pass testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still sell weed that has been
sprayed with shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to waste my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell it to the clubs and people
buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those people test it on their own
just because they want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still finding out that people
are still spraying Eagle 20, Havit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think all that will change now
in California?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it's going to.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely going to change here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's this crazy little bubble that's
going to pop.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to hear how some shit's going to
go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a wise one.
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2 is going to try and make a comeback,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like over the next 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People taste things.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do taste things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But check me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a CO2 fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a CO2 fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you smoke rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you smoke CO2 before rosin?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'd rather smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't smoke CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of us here are saying yes to
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if you give me a CO2 pen and I hit it
and you don't tell me it's CO2 and I hit
[SPEAKER_06]: it, I'm mad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a shitty attitude real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I about fist fought Addison the first time
I ever met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the same way about Mexican CBD,
bad Mexican CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody loves the Mexican CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have ran with our fucking jokes,
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally had somebody fucking come to
me and was like, hey, I heard some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard what Mexican CBD is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, I heard you do Mexican CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, bro, I go to bed at 9 o'clock
at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stay awake.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wake up at 530.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fuck are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a goddamn joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to edit any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be going up just like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've said this on my live before,
too, because like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granny, you're all red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, am I really part of this?
[SPEAKER_06]: We always we always laugh and joke because
everybody imagines this fucking crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not all Addison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a crazy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You more so than probably any of us
sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My life is chill, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at your hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your hair says I like to party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I didn't know you, I'd be like,
bro, where's the party at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude's got a mohawk and a beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's ready to get down and no shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to party like once a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one painted toenail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you guys, you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he is not a drug lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do Instagram live and start his
toe and scroll up his leg to his face.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people are like, oh, who's Jeff with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys want to see?
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw the hearts down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put this I put I wore this today with
flip flops.
[SPEAKER_06]: These Easter ass shorts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a pink shirt on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a plane from California or no,
from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were coming from Cali from
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what made it funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ask the TSA agent for a lighter to
light your joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, that's how I like to party.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's that's how I'm wild and
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like airsoft and I like smoking weed in
fucking public places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sue me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking sue me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's those are acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not causing any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I play airsoft with you to take one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I moved to Hollywood and
everybody's like, kid, he's going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: strung out on heroin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, bro, I don't even take allergy
pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they really say that?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they did.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like everybody, everybody's like
seeing me out party and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that I think you smell my man
have fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the guy have your business,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I am a businessman.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm professional.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was the that was the message I
got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I randomly got some message from some
follow that was like, oh, you're some
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking junkie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what the fuck are you talking
about?
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the Mexican.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I know what Mexican CBD means.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, bro, we made a joke because people
were snorting CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were like, oh, fucking you know,
somebody out here is like got some
[SPEAKER_06]: straight fucking cocaine, CBD mix,
personal shit that they're snorting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were like, yeah, fucking Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican CBD, you know, saying a strong
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it be and it like became this like
standing joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, whenever you're at one of
these fucking weed parties, there's
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody there that's like going to
justifiably.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always get that one guy that tries to
justifiably talk about some other drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do it because of this, bro,
just once in a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, but now it's it's it's it's it's
a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you guys all know what the Mexican
it's the most it's mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one on the joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, yeah, it's today's headline in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Colorado is working to work
legalize mushrooms for medicinal use
[SPEAKER_06]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like if we're because I mean,
I've said what drugs I don't do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say what drugs I do do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love again in moderation, in moderation
and in safe environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're extremely I think they
show a lot of promise in depression and
[SPEAKER_06]: social anxiety issues, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read at least one Terrence McKenna book
before you venture into the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I've had nothing but pleasant,
you know, psycho fucking out there
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to recharge the spiritual battery
just as much as the next refresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a what's a spiritual dose for
getting a lot?
A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hesitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably more than I should talk about on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I do find the need for those like and
I can tell like when you I'm not a
[SPEAKER_06]: religious man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I like to consider myself a
relatively spiritual man, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like in the sense that I try to flow with
the universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to go and I try to be aware of my
surroundings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I feel like I need to get back to
the part of my brain that I shut away day
[SPEAKER_06]: after day, when I go to work, I lock in
the back of my mind that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the the the the creative thoughts that
flow and sit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke weed to fucking deal with stress
and I enjoy taste and like and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I feel better smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's to numb the pain like I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do hallucinogens to to look the pain in
the eye and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you all, but every time
I get done, I kind of know what I need to
[SPEAKER_06]: do with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be real with myself when I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very introspective when I do
hallucinogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to do them at parties or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the by yourself, by the campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally by the campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you you're three gram, five gram,
seven gram kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, seven gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone that's this dude's over here
shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just getting started or is that
blowing you out of the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I'm too old for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everybody who wants to remain
anonymous on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got another I'm too old for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple I'm too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a we got one guy rubbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm probably older than all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he doesn't like him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like Kevin enjoyed himself the last
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw some Instagram videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to incriminate anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that has to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the auras were wonderful that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I totally think that, you know,
with my experience in the past with it and
[SPEAKER_06]: like it should absolutely be thought of as
a type of therapy for for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially people who don't produce
dopamine, which are like a lot of TBI
[SPEAKER_06]: people because of because of our long
running war.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of TBI survivors that also
have PTSD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really works.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're kind of both of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see in the headlines a lot that,
you know, that that is like something that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're trying to at least get some
attention on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think because of Colorado,
we have a huge military population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of veterans here that have
been through those wars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe that has something to do
with why they are looking into it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the large population really
has a lot of the VA here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, I think, honestly, with the the
the pressure that they've had on them from
[SPEAKER_06]: our soldiers coming home that are,
you know, the VA, their MO is kind of like
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicaid, the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, heavily, heavily.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think their pressure for marijuana has
got the same people showing up saying
[SPEAKER_06]: there's other alternatives, not just
marijuana, but, you know, LSD,
[SPEAKER_06]: mushrooms, therapeutic doses, micro dosing
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people that that are that
micro dose that say this is like changes
[SPEAKER_06]: everything about my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow people on Instagram that do a
journal every day and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I take this much and this is how it's
improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it working for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything that's growing out of
the earth was put here for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will fucking kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it at the right dose will cure
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wrong dose will just ruin you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never encourage anybody to recklessly do
anything and like never do anything that
[SPEAKER_06]: jeopardize anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like I've always chose to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do it in a safe environment when I do
any kind of hallucinogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like I never would drive or have
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you'd be lucky to get me out of my
bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if I had seven grams at once,
I would not be driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way you get to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to micro dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference in a spiritual dose
and a micro dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm going in, I'm going for that
spiritual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to look in there and have the
problem identify and then dance around in
[SPEAKER_00]: my head and then find a solution to that
problem and then wake up the next day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's straight up epiphany juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other things that will take me
to that realm much more quickly and reveal
[SPEAKER_00]: problems for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll talk about those on other
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little giggles throughout the room
for the folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have participated in our.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it like, you know, DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never done DMT over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to open your brain one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show you what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the the the thing, you know,
it turned me off about DMT.
[SPEAKER_06]: The taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked DMT through a Hellstone pipe with
Terps on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just looked at me like I was a
genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never ever had that thought before.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the Hellstone pipe is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Terps on top that that would just
blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watch somebody who won't be named who
won a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, a special shout out to the crew
of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Team Elite Genetics, my boys, kind Bill,
Ryan, me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won another cup up in NorCal this last
trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like round them up six for me now like
these getting heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's I think I said the last
three.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know they entered the
product until we had won.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a phone call when I was airsofting
that we won down in SoCal on the product
[SPEAKER_06]: that we ran for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got great product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was going so I was somebody at why
you will not do DMT.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, somebody at the cup like I watched
somebody hit a big hit of DMT and then go
[SPEAKER_06]: up, accept their award on stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you all know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wasn't slobbering all over himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody in the world would have known.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a total like he didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just totally witnessed it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much of this I want to
say, but DMT is a three puff drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper starts crinkling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about 15 minutes later,
everything is just you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I'm not floating in gelatin or
something anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm normal again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that first one I could see maybe maybe
functioning off one light puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two, you start getting somewhere in
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're scraping the moon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the moon.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these great analogies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, listen, listen, these are great
analogies.
[SPEAKER_06]: But somebody once told me I think it was a
Joe Rogan podcast that I heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, doing DMT is like having your
computer desktop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like doing DMT takes all the
files on your desktop and shrinks them
[SPEAKER_06]: down into one file that was labeled my old
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a real good analogy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have way too many motherfucking
responsibilities to not give a fuck about
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scared to death that I'm going to do
DMT and go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't do that to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You already know, Pippen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You already know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never talked about this on the pod.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you smoke DMT and you know it's over,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was you thinking?
[SPEAKER_06]: You went so many years without going,
hey, do it because it's going to ruin your
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't ruin my life, but it'll change it
drastically.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will change.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will change your thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not as drastically as you're going to
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done a psychedelic drug since my
traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a severe traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a little while, I heard a humming
noise that would not go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that noise is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm afraid that if I do any drugs,
it's going to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it comes back, I don't know how I'm
going to handle it, especially if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: tripping or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before then, it would not be rare to
find me doing a blasted DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I felt like it would do was,
I describe them as the Mooninites from
[SPEAKER_00]: Occoutine Hunger Force, those little
square guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those little guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a blasted DMT.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us your microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fall back into the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those little guys danced around in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they said was, hey, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just kept rubbing me on my knee
and on my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd go, it's OK, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start thinking about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what could they mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that triggers you to go, well,
what could they mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you remember, well, that happened
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go, oh, well, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start remembering all this dumb
shit that you've suppressed or that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with or whatever dumb shit,
trivial shit that shouldn't even be
[SPEAKER_00]: bugging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pops up in your head vividly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got spotlights on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can rotate it in every direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at it from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at it from the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've stepped back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pivot it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those little guys, they go,
hey, bro, did you ever think of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just clinging to some stupid
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come out of it and you go,
oh, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like cleaning your stupid shit filter
is kind of what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to get like if you're
stuck on something, if something happened
[SPEAKER_00]: and you got a thing in your brain,
you're like, why this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a fucking how or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke some DMT and put that in your mind
and you'll you'll know why or how.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to work on what I'm looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But DMT is like a 15, 30 minute,
30 minutes at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're you're like, oh, I was so
fucked up 30 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I retire, I'm going to become that
old hippie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that I am living proof of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I work.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you retire, you can do whatever you
damn well believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch Granny on Instagram and it makes
me fucking envious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microphone voice, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microphone voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hella jelly watching her sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, she's living life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk shit to her about shouldn't
she be doing something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny's like church around my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my girl wake up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her kids are raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's fucking got her thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a great husband that supports me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're watching her on Instagram,
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get off the couch and do something with
your granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wake up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabby's usually made me coffee like and on
days when Gabby don't have to wake up
[SPEAKER_06]: early.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll lay in bed in the morning and watch
if I don't if I don't go live with her,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's because I'm laying in bed with Gabby
and we're just watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this morning they were like,
where's Giddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy up could come and I wouldn't even
have him come live with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't even ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you were live in the shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn this place down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I pack up my gear first?
[SPEAKER_02]: I go on live the other day and they were
like, all the followers are going,
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny, you missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I miss?
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy was live from the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed it, Granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy up was live in the shower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a waterproof phone now and a firm
grip.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll let you get in on the shower and
just follow my private Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get a bunch of lovely female
followers after you go live with Granny?
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've told her this before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I saw my analytics one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like 65 percent female followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Call shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_00]: My feed's a sausage fest, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's like 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm like shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go look at my followers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granny, when you see me go live and my
followers, it's the majority.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every dude in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a facial scrubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do to them?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I do, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got black girl magic, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: My girlfriend oils me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that cocoa butter?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, my girl is actually- I've never
dropped the mic for somebody else before.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I got black girl magic, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just magical.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's doing wonders, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're glowing, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: My girl Gabby makes it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mohawk, the beard, the glowing skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: She makes her own essential oil mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: She hits me up with like rose oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rose oil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, rose oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't be a thieves oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't be giving like shit out.
[SPEAKER_06]: People all be doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: People all look gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am at heart a scientist, if I may not be
one in degree or education.
A beauty scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: But thieves oil, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thieves oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know about thieves oil.
Thieves?
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually don't fuck with them thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't fuck with thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to take a second to plug in my
private premium Snapchat if you guys want

[SPEAKER_06]: Making a joke about follow my premium

flourishing.

[SPEAKER_06]: I've personally never paid for a premium
Snapchat or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to pay for premium Snapchat,
