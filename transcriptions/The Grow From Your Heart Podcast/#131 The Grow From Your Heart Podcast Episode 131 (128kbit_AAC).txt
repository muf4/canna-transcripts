[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 131 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends,
CallMeRoss2Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, make sure you catch the Mystic
Roots Band on tour this summer with
[SPEAKER_00]: Ketchafaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing like five or six Colorado
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at probably one or two of them,
and I do hope to see your smiling face
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you walk up to me, tell me that
you heard about the concert through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably smoke a dab with you after
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so make sure you guys support
the Mystic Roots Band and the Ketchafaya
[SPEAKER_00]: tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traveling all around the country this
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some fat dabs, of course,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, I'm hitting the Hitman Sampson
collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a sweet ass Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a green, kind of a teal green
aquamarine mix base on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some green labels to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I've got that hooked up to the
G-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The E-nail from our good friends at
Emotec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that, of course, runs to the
D-nail adapter from our good friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to everybody that keeps me
laced up, keeps me dabbing, keeps me
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing my face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, while I'm at it, huge shout out to
our friends at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot forget Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to the entire Oil Slick crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, let's get into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some stuff I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It finally happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I got fucking pulled over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going a little bit too fast on the
interstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him get behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, ah, shit, here they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here he was right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those red and blue lights got right up on
my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled over quickly because I saw that
he was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to be wearing my brand new I'm
higher than you t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He threw me an I'm higher than you
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got this shirt on that says
straight up, I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get pulled over by the State Patrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: State Trooper was actually pretty damn
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walked up to me and he said,
sir, I pulled you over because you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going a little too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my only answer was, yes, sir,
because I knew I was going too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told him, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, can I see your license
registration proof of insurance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already had it in my hand because
I'm quick and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, here you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, do you have any marijuana in
the vehicle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hesitated for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't going to lie to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at my center console in
my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked for the backseat to see
where all my bags were and see what I had
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked him straight in the face and
I said, there might be some weed in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of looked at me weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, but I've got a medical
marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assure you, I'm not intoxicated by
any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on my way to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he goes, well, it really smells in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, and I had my, when you
work in a legal facility here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to wear a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happened to have it on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just showed him my badge real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, sir, I work in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cop, you guys, this is why I'm
telling you this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cop looked at me and he said,
oh, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter works in a grow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go run your plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cop, his daughter, this guy's a
state trooper and his daughter works in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes and he runs my plates and runs
my license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not wanted or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just sat there and waited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took a Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to see up on my Instagram
and on Snapchat and on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a picture of me being pulled over
by this cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes and he runs my license.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does what he's got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually pretty quick about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of times I've been pulled over
and they make you just sit there all day
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure you're late for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this guy was pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went and he wrote me a warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not write me a speeding ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote me an official warning and he
told me to set it on the dash to remind me
[SPEAKER_00]: to quit speeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the warning sitting up on the
dash so that every time I start to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: the left lane to pass somebody,
it reminds me of, hey, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a ticket next time because that cop is
really cool to you last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a warning sitting up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to the
state trooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say his name,
but shout out to the state trooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not harass me when I completely
reeked of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not write me a ticket when I was
obviously blatantly speeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to the Colorado State
Patrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not fuck my day up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not fuck my life up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things could have gone very differently as
we've learned with my friend John
[SPEAKER_00]: Randall's Jr. So a big shout out to the
state patrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to John Rastafari for
keeping an eye straight through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, it's all about how you handle
the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado and you get pulled
over and they ask if you've got cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the car, just admit it because lying to
the cops is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having cannabis in Colorado is not
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to lie to him about having
weed, he's not going to trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to think you're hiding some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to hide your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, this is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't have pounds,
if you've got your legal limit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are doing something illegal and
you got more than you should, don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we went over that in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only break one rule at a time,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit talking about a traffic stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about the police,
here's one more thing I do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I don't know if everybody that
listens realizes that I am the owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: founder, proprietor, head breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am iRead Genetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the seed company that makes feminized
and regular cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I receive a lot of messages on Instagram,
Facebook, emails, any, any forum you could
[SPEAKER_00]: think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get an email or a message via that
service asking me to ship seeds to people
[SPEAKER_00]: in various locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I might've said this on another
episode, but I have to remind you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot ship seeds to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to be fully legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be fully legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to break any rules here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're letting us grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a wonderful job at Green and
Healthy Wellness as the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for me to screw that up in
my life by sending people seeds to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: few extra bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing just fine financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing fucking great financially,
not to brag, but I mean, there's no,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even need to send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a website, however, they are
called thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have my seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are currently sold out is what I'm
told.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get a package in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise you when.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when they'll put them on
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they'll even make it to
the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have people lined up on a waiting
list already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I do know as soon as
they get those seeds, they sell out
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to pay attention to
thedankteam.com if you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have iry genetic seeds,
check out Sin City, check out Mile High,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Dankness is always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if the Sour Seed Company is
on there, but I highly recommend the Sour
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never go wrong with the Cali
Connection and you can never go wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find yourself some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they aren't iry seeds,
you can get them at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that I can't ship you seeds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be safe, trying to be
careful, trying not to break any rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're here in Colorado and you're 21
and over, find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put some seeds in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to be fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be polite about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't ship you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this was a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and open up the
Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking my phone a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might edit part of this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the damn message?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message comes from a friend on the
Grow From Your Heart podcast Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from our friend Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a few plants from seed and I
was wondering if when I take a cutting to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower for determining sex, if I should
flower the clone or the rooted seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could swear that I heard you say it was
better to flower the rooted seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I remember that correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a rule to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up and tell you basically what
this person's asking just to be more clear
[SPEAKER_00]: in case you guys aren't caught up to what
the question here is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow a plant from seed,
you don't know if that plant is a male or
[SPEAKER_00]: a female unless, of course, it came from
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a regular seed, it's got a
50-50 chance of being a male or a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to waste a lot of time,
space, energy, nutrients, and water on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're breeding, you need to
eliminate your male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once your seed plant gets large enough,
I recommend taking a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that clone establish healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you need to flower either the
original plant from seed or that clone to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if that plant is a male or a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up to you if you want to
flower out the plant that came from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you want to flower the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are advantages and disadvantages to
both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that plant that came from
seed and it's big enough to take a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: once that clone is rooted and you know
you've got a copy of it, you're safe to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower out that seed plant, the original
plant from seed, because now you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: backup in the clone room, in the mom room,
whatever, in the veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a backup of that plant over
there, and you've already got a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's established and that's large and
that's healthy and is ready to flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to throw out some buds for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always flower out that seed
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to that is it's already
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it, a big healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really like to keep that
original seeded plant from seed around as
[SPEAKER_00]: their mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to keep that one because it was
the original and they feel like it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: more vigor and it's got more strength to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like if you take a clone and
you do it properly and that clone is cared
[SPEAKER_00]: for and the mother plant, the donor plant,
was healthy when the clone was taken,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the clone and that seed plant
are going to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take your clone, you can let
your clone root, you can get your clone
[SPEAKER_00]: into soil, you can get it into a good pot,
get some roots established.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran phenohunts from cups before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done plenty of plant sexting while
clones were just in little tiny cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take your clone and you can
either pot it into a larger pot if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, or you can leave it in the cup and
put it in the flower room and put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, change the lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, within seven to 10 days,
you're going to see if that plant is a
[SPEAKER_00]: male or a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the main advantages to keeping
your clones in cups and using the cup
[SPEAKER_00]: method to do a sexting round is that it
takes way less space to run a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of cups than it would run a bunch of
potted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing a large phenohunt of
like maybe 25 to 50 plants, it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to have 25 to 50 cups underneath
the light with little tiny clones in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just waiting to show you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you didn't waste time growing
large plants and then you grew out a male
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage to do in the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you, whichever you want to do,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take it, always take a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow that plant from seed, take a
clone, get the clone rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run that clone as your
flowering plant to determine sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run that seed as your
flowering plant to determine sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you keep one of them back to
have in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run that clone, you've already got
a big mother plant waiting to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run the mother plant that came from
seed, you've already got a big bushy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a production facility, what I do is I
plant the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the seed grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that clone shows me roots,
I throw that clone into a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I actually flower out the
original plant from seed because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, in a commercial production
facility, I don't have a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: space for extra plants sitting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to waste my plant count
because we are based on a plant count
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are a medical facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to have so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I've already got a plant that's
large enough to flower, I go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that plant out to find out what
I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I find out that I've got a male,
usually I go throw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut that male down, take it out of the
computer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go and take down every clone
also that I have made of that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we eliminate those as well so that we
don't have any males sitting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how, mainly how we work on
sexing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of helps me segue into something
else I wanted to talk about, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: revegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you can do,
I do not use this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know plenty of people that do.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, this seems a little bit harsh to
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What some people do, you can take a plant
and put it into your flowering room for
[SPEAKER_00]: seven to 10 days, just long enough to show
you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I think I can spot a male more
early than I can a female because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing it for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the males try to show you sex a
little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take your plants, put them in the
flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them start showing you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you are sure of the sex,
take them out of the flowering room,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them back in the veg room under 24
hours of light, and they will go back into
[SPEAKER_00]: veg for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take them a couple of weeks,
but they will go back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what some people do, they plant a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let the seed grow until it's decent
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when you put that seed into your
three gallon pot, let it get rooted and
[SPEAKER_00]: then move it to the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just leave it there for a
few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've got a little plant that's
starting to show sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as it shows sex,
they put it back in the veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a female, they put it back into
the veg room and grow it up to the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: size that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take a clone from it and then flower
that plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this sounds harsh, but it does have
its advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main advantage here is that you don't
need to take any clones and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: waste a lot of time and space growing
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your plants and you put them
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you see boys, you throw
them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now you can just move your plants
right back into the veg room and just grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those females up to their full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you establish sex without taking any
clones and now you know what you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've eliminated your boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes flower time, you know
you're working with all girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend taking a clone from
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you flower those plants,
please take a clone because you might grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the most amazing cannabis you've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a clone from it,
you're going to kick yourself in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reveging is also used after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen people finish a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a plant that takes nine weeks to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flower it out for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You harvest most of it, but you just leave
one or two branches on that plant and then
[SPEAKER_00]: put that plant with one or two harvested
plant with one or two branches on it under
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take probably two
months, honestly, before that plant starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow back as a normal vegging plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't take a clone,
this is your only way to rescue your
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take this sad looking mostly harvested
plant and you torture it by putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: under a light for about two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to feed it kind of a heavy
nitrogen diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll bring it back around to the veg
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are going to start curling and
looking like arthritis hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be spirally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is going to be pissed off for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as you see those normal leaves
start coming out, your plant is going back
[SPEAKER_00]: into its normal stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones have started reconverting
back into the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to know what's going on with
life again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend at that point,
as soon as you have a couple of healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots that look normal, clone those and
take those clones and use those clones as
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got that strain around
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep one clone and flower out the other
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got that strain forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do make the mistake of not
taking a clone and you realize that this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you're growing is going to be
one of the most amazing things you've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen, revegging is probably the only way
to rescue this strain other than a tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not prepared to teach you how to
do a tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Elizabeth, I hope I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I did not give a definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said that it's kind of up to you
and your environment and the way that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do things, but I hope I helped you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for giving me the opportunity
to talk about how to sex your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: revegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next topic comes from at the Barefoot
Grower on Instagram, also known as Will on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will had no idea I was going to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will posted a Facebook post today that
simply said, stop smoking blunts in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is such a good post.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had no idea I was going to talk about
this on the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see people posting pictures of
themselves on Facebook, on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: on Snapchat, and they are smoking blunts,
smoking bulls and smoking dabs in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a really bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think smoking a blunt in a grow room is
going to impart that blunt taste on your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before those buds are even done,
they're already going to taste like a
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty blunt wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry, you guys, I don't prefer the
flavor of a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow some of the best cannabis we can
possibly grow on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you wrap it up in a shitty ass
tobacco leaf with some fake flavoring in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a backwood with my buddy the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into the blunts, but I feel that
blowing this blunt smoke on your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: around your plants is going to make your
plants taste like a dirty ass blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also here's what Will had to say about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will said tobacco smoke is very thick and
actually can suffocate your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping the photosynthesis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant will be too busy
breathing and filtering the smoke to take
[SPEAKER_00]: in CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also goes on to say also
blunts and most over-the-counter tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: products have a ton of chemicals in them
that are bad for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarettes are the main concern,
but blunts will begin to show harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: results if done regularly and frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you shouldn't smoke anything in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, but if you're going to,
it should be a bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less carcinogens in the air,
the healthier your plants will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will, good post, great post.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys quit smoking in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be in the grow room
giving your plants smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be in the grow room giving
your plants love and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't blow smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep the plants clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to ruin the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the terps nowadays and
nobody wants tobacco terps in their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody wants tobacco terps in
their cannabis, but 99% of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want tobacco terps in their
cannabis and nobody wants tobacco terps in
[SPEAKER_00]: their concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop smoking blunts in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop smoking anything in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke at the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke at the dab table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't smoke in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for your plants and quit
smoking cigarettes and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's just get down on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking for nearly 19 minutes,
so I think it's time for me to press
[SPEAKER_00]: pause, take a drink, take a fat dab and I
will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of fat dabs and I got a
nice drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was taking a drink, I was drinking
some kombucha, some GTs kombucha organic
[SPEAKER_00]: and raw original with enzymes and
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminded me that a listener
recently asked me a question about
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me if I could recommend a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked about a specific brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, what I like is the brand raw
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy specific blends for men or
women or for older folks or for children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure that the person that
emailed me was a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend the raw probiotics
for men.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available at most health food
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the probiotics I would support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about cannabis related
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody recently sent me a message asking
me if I think holding in your smoke gets
[SPEAKER_00]: you higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a dab, if you take a bong rip,
if you smoke a joint, do you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: holding your hit, holding your smoke in
your lungs gives you a better buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I'm going to say I'm not a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put that out there straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my stoner opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I take a dab,
I feel like most of what I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into my lungs pretty quickly within
probably three seconds at the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe five seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have absorbed everything that that dab
is going to give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it sit for about a half a second,
maybe a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull in the dab and then I blow it back
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only in me for just a brief second,
just so that I could feel it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I push it back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when you keep the smoke in
your lungs is when it's going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my lungs absorb everything
they're going to get really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I keep that smoke in there,
I'm going to start absorbing the TARS and
[SPEAKER_00]: the soot and the extra crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke is going to stick to my lungs
and I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the CBD, the CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the good medical benefits,
not the bad part of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think taking a big fat dab and
holding it in, you might not get higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're just getting a head rush
from lack of oxygen and you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling a rush because you're not giving
yourself any air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like that pressure,
having your lungs inflated like that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably very strenuous on your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably hurt yourself by doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those people that take in a big hit
and they cough and they try not to cough
[SPEAKER_00]: and hold in the big hit, you make this
noise, you start doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like that's going to blow
something up in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to rupture the lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fucking blow a blood
vessel in your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to get the smoke in and
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think smoke needs to sit around in
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you get higher from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to absorb more
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to happen almost
instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're just putting yourself at
risk for COPD or other lung problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to elaborate on this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I think happens,
I take ginormous dabs sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I took a two gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not able to put two grams on the nail
and pull it all into my lungs in one draw
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would have to put the nail
really hot to get it to burn or vaporize
[SPEAKER_00]: that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am taking multiple inhalations,
but I'm not taking a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dropping one and a half to two grams
of dabs on the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop it right on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to slowly stir it into the nail
and let it melt into there and then carb
[SPEAKER_00]: cap it and just start sucking on that rig,
pulling a big fat hit, blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling another rip, blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll take me three or four full
inhalations of full lung expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can feel the hash coat my
lungs and I feel like I'm giving myself a
[SPEAKER_00]: time release medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking so much hash in one quick time
period that I'm coating my lungs with
[SPEAKER_00]: enough oil to where my body can't absorb
it all at once, but there's nowhere for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this oil kind of hangs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this hash is just hanging out stuck to
my lung and as my body can absorb it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that hash is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs are just sucking up that hash oil
the whole time and I'm just absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: those cannabinoids and absorbing those
medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving myself a time release
medication by taking these ginormous dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no science to that, but I feel like
I stay high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep getting higher and higher and
higher as it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I won't have smoked for a full
hour and I'll still be fully medicated
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that a layer of dab that
is coated in my lungs is just being
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by my body slowly and getting
into my bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my elaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion, holding smoke is a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to hold it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe it in, blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take another damn dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got another dab for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your lungs only get so much use
before they wear out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you get so many inhales and
exhales of your lungs before they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tire out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wear your lungs out by holding in
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of more things I want to
talk about and then we're going to wrap up
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something random.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, wear some protective eyewear in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running more than four,
maybe five or six lights in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get yourself some Method 7
glasses and protect your eyes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also protect your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a room with 10 or more lights
and you're in there for more than a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day, it's a good idea to wear some
sort of long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your head covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that those lights are not good
for your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun gives us cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why won't these artificial lights give us
some sort of skin problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I highly recommend covering up
your skin and your eyes if you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear my Method 7 glasses from the minute
I walk into the grow room to the minute I
[SPEAKER_00]: walk out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Method 7s on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to wear a long sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the grow room, it gets kind of hot,
but it's still worth wearing a long sleeve
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's something really random.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the grow room, if you've
got a bunch of sticks, if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks in there to support your plants,
watch your eyes around those sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw somebody bend over the other day to
take care of a plant, and if he wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention, that stick would have
gone way far into his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of poked his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't hurt him because he saw it
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw it because it literally went into
his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kneeling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the stick right into his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't fuck him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be just fine, but I don't want that
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very aware of those sticks in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grow, I like a tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the commercial grow, we like to use the
big trellis nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have used the sticks before,
and I'll probably use them again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not my preferred method at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using them, I do recommend
that you watch your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm talking about grow room safety,
here's another thing you should think
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a smoke detector inside of
each grow room and you should also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire extinguisher on the exterior of each
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put your fire extinguisher inside
the grow room because if there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in there, you don't want to have
to kick down the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and get your fire extinguisher
and try to put the fire out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that fire extinguisher on the
outside by the door so that if something's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and you kick the door down and spray
the fuck out of that fire, solve the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoke detectors and fire extinguishers
are a big advantage for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I think that's all I've
got for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, I've got Jesse coming back
for another outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, if you're listening, it is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a swap cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what a swap cast is,
I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and 44 and Dirty D, they have a
podcast called the Call Rod Dope Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have them come on here,
all three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record one podcast and we will both
put it out on our feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do a Call Rod Dope Grow From Your
Heart Podcast combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about growing dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about Colorado life and then
we'll both put it up on our feeds and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: expose my audience to the Call Rod Dope
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Call Rod Dope Podcast will expose
their audience to myself and the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, we'll get Jesse and the
crew on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are listening, this is the
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is time to get Mike and Lindsey
back so we can talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you two are listening, start doing your
homework, get an episode prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you back on here because that's
all I have got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would appreciate is if you go to
iTunes, find the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_00]: search for the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a rating that you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even asking for five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to go and click what you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your comments on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
