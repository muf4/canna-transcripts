[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and it is time for episode 585 of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dads of OG Lime
Killer Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it smells like limes and Gatorade
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice head buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me talking kind of fast,
and it's got my brain moving quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should make perfect podcast
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the OG Lime Killer
Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who

[SPEAKER_00]: I had to replenish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those already sold out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go quickly, grab your t-shirts and
hoodies before they sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough chatter here at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into a few Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great message here right in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Creos.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Creos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love picking on you, making fun of your
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all in love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just flipped to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people follow the full moon for
their flowering cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I probably F that up by
taking pictures just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turned it to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights went off and you realized I
should take some pictures in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it was the first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says it was day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no worries there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the big one is a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shorter one is morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably need to make the canopy more
even for flower, uh, flower picks in 63 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's sent me some vegetative pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not save them to show them to you
guys, but we've got the important part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the email and I look forward to seeing a
flower picks in 63 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch me around week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the photos start getting
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So snap some photos then anyway,
there is a lot to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for the reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to send you an email with
some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the great part of the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says with your new LEDs, do you notice
it takes less time to finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure if you've been paying
attention to the show, you know that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: started growing in some spaces with black
sale, uh, Canon LEDs from black sale
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do enjoy and appreciate the
results I am seeing with my led lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are growing quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stocks are a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internode spacing is a little bit
tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants seem overall just a little bit
healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, do I notice it takes less time to
finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do notice that it could probably,
uh, come down about three to five days
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner than what I'm used to with the HPS
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're finishing up a little bit more
quickly, uh, just three to five days,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a week at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough, uh, experience yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough completed crops to
have a good, solid, reliable report,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yes, it did seem like they finished a
little bit earlier this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say how far above the
canopy do you hang your led lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, unfortunately I ran out of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off at the recommended,
uh, black sale sends a recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: sheet in the, with the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a little instruction sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they say to start off about 36
inches above the canopy to the best of my
[SPEAKER_00]: memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off as recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that the plants were happy,
but I thought maybe they could take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lowered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them into flower and that thing that
happens, the plants got taller than
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't flower early enough and they got
real tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was worried that those plants were going
to get burned by that bright light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got about 10 to 14 inches,
somewhere in that range, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which plant it was, which phenotype it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got about 10 to 14 inches from those
LEDs and they did not cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no crinkling, no burning,
no leaf issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looked okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 10 to 14 inches didn't seem to cause
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, uh, they needed a lot of water
at that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were definitely drinking and eating a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 to 14 inches is as close as I would
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason I did that is because
I ran out of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing that strawberry starburst in
there, the strawberry fields in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it got up near the lights because it
was just growing too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got tall on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer to stay probably about 18
inches away from that light, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see any problems when I got 10 to 14 other
than I needed more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says dimmed or no, I don't dim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't dim the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid for that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all the wattage from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could have dimmed it when they
were getting close, but that's just not my
[SPEAKER_00]: style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yes, they did finish faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they did start to grow into the light
and no, I did not dim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the notes that I wrote down for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, should I feed to week six and
flush on the plants in these pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where we get into another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these plants were supposed to be in
cocoa, but I used a hot organic mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: then transplanted into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where your plants are
getting a little bit confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got one rhizosphere right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soil and it's holding a bunch of
nutrients and it's a hot mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the outside you got cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, I feed them half strength
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go heavier than that at the moment,
uh, cause you've got two different root
[SPEAKER_00]: zones and they're kind of confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said most likely the VPD is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think the VPD is too high,
you're probably correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say it could be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably exactly what it is
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open vented with 86 degrees and 63%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit warm and that's a lot
of humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it says, but I plan to close
things up and use the AC and add CO2 a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, your VPD is off and I don't have
a picture of those plants to help you out,
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you what to do with them,
but it does sound like, yes, your VPD is
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking if you should, uh,
feed till week six and then flush the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a picture to tell you,
but if you think the VPD is off,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a flush, then get them on a
solid regular feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wash out that, uh, cocoa soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to take one rinse to get
anything out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mix up a solid feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good, a good NPK, a good
CalMac, put some enzymes in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some microbes in there, maybe a kelp
product in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good solid diet for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a good solid meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they just got out of jail or the
hospital and you want to feed them up real
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and get them healthy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a rinse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all the crap out of them, mix up a
solid feed and then feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's pay attention to what
happens to them from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also let's correct the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That VPD is probably, uh, making it not
able to making the plants not able to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't get the proper nutrition if
you're even giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're confused by that double root
zone stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to do with the soil
is mixed, the hot soil is mixed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle and the cocoa on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're confused, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be a struggle for the
next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in week six, I would say flush
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them with a good feed, see how they
react and then consider your moves from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they respond well to that flushing and
new feeding, uh, proceed with caution
[SPEAKER_00]: until about week eight, then flush and
then finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they keep acting weird, you're going to
have to adjust your feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you said that they go, they burn if
you go any more than half strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed them half strength, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going half strength all the way up to
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to nurse them all the way to the end
and learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby them learn as much as you can take a
lot of notes, observe a lot, see what they
[SPEAKER_00]: do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says at last question at harvest,
did the pistols shrivel when the bud is
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe or should I just watch the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look right into the camera
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always judge ripeness by your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what tells you when the plants are
ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pistols, the stigmas, those are the
breeding parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are there to catch pollen and slide
that pollen down into the calyx,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ovule, start making a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pistols, those stigmas, aren't for
ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to smoke them because they're
there, but they don't have anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the buzz, with the ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could wipe all of those off and the
cannabis will still be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will still be high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the hairs from your buds end up in
the bottom of the bag before you smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: and all you smoke are trichomes,
you'll still get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the trichomes come off your buds
and all you smoke are hairs, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not judge ripeness ever by the
pistols or the stigmas of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to determine ripeness of a
cannabis plant is through the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say 20 to 30 percent
amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them down, dry them and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be perfect at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judge your ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking into the camera right here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to zoom in on my face for this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always determine the ripeness of your
cannabis plants by the color of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to smoke the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make a concentrate,
all you're going to consume is the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to smoke the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to smoke the hairs or the
stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to smoke ripe trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So judge all of your ripeness by your
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you cut down is when the
trichomes are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered all of the questions in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says thanks for the advice and reply in
advance from your friend, Kriyas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Chris, thanks for all of the
continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize that this one took me a
minute to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw the date on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm late, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out and thank you for the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message comes from a good friend
known as Yee Muffuckin Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spells it Y-E-E-M-U-F-U-K-K-I-N-H-A-W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case you wondered, that looks like
Yee Muffuckin Ha to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off with, I re-army for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re-army for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, how's it going,
Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your friend Yee Muffuckin Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you and your loved ones are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself am great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that my loved ones are
doing well also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I would love to hear your
thoughts on how you would strategize if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were in a scenario similar to the
situation I am in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing nothing more than your
own small personal garden, I've got a 3 by
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 or a 3.5 by 3.5 veg space and a 5 by 5
flower space and a separate spot for
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you be looking for in regards
to narrowing out about three keepers if
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal is to have a rotation of flavors
as well as trying to avoid tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup to a particular cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said my first set of iry beans arrived in
April and after running the females
[SPEAKER_00]: through flower a couple of times and
separating the good weed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible weed, I have a firefly and a
lemon jeffery that are both far superior
[SPEAKER_00]: to any herb you can find for miles around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love hearing that my genetics are
making people happy and that they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: superior product compared to everybody
around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on to say, what does it say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarlet begonias is also incredibly
bonkers, but she grows so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hard time staying on top of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a bummer that that plant grows
so fast it messes up your schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the redheaded stranger that I
bred it from was in my commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cut clones of that two weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut clones of everybody else today
and then in two weeks we'll cut that one
[SPEAKER_00]: because she's going to go so quickly that
I just don't need her for that two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll get way too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll outgrow everybody else and fuck up
the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mommy plant that made that one had
hyper, hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my mic right in my face
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know lemon skunk is the mother
of both firefly and lemon jeffery,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though these two are not that similar
to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can part with one of them,
I'll have to make a tough decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, one will stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where would you go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were trying to establish a small
variety of killers, that would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a medical grower and you're
growing for yourself, you need to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your medicine supplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you continue to smoke the same
thing over and over again, you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: what I call strain lock or strain burnout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smoked lemon jeffery is one of my top
five favorite strains ever of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smoked lemon jeffery all day,
every day by day seven or eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a heavy smoker, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may take most people like a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take me a week, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be smoking it and smoking it
on days one through eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day three, I'm going to be like,
this is good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day four, I'm going to be like,
that ain't working so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day five, I'm going to be like,
yeah, I need to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day seven, I'm going to be like,
nothing's even happening when I smoke all
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe you get sort of a strain
lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get too used to smoking the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're growing for a profit,
you need to switch it up to switch it up
[SPEAKER_00]: for your clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to get bored buying the
same shit all the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep a good rotation of just
three different strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did say that you've got the lemon
Jeffrey in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you've got the firefly in there
and you mentioned scarlet begonias and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want three keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're in love with the
firefly and the lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are similar, but different,
which will be, that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those work for you medicinally,
they are very similar, but also very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to have similar medicinal
properties, but they'll be different
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to where I think you could probably
switch them out and not get a strain lock
[SPEAKER_00]: from switching those two different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said you've got the scarlet
begonias, but it goes too fast for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's incredibly bonkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the head buzzes, the sativa
dominant varieties that come from that
[SPEAKER_00]: scarlet begonias cross will give you a
panic attack to make you feel all warm
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smoke it, make you feel like your
blood's on fire and you got a sweater on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just get so hot and panicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is bonkers is a great word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says, where would you go if you had
to pick three, four, killers for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what works the best for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like those two lemon strains are
working great for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like the scarlet begonias
was your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would pick one for
the day and one for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then possibly either one to pay the
bills, if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe one for rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your lemon sunrise,
you got your lemon Jeffrey, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: need something else in there just to
rotate out of those two are kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon sunrise and lemon Jeffrey are more,
I would consider daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep you up, keep your
head going, keep your brain spinning,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep you active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend maybe something a
little bit more mellow, maybe something
[SPEAKER_00]: like the double dose or the dark hollow or
something kind of chill you out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those are so far, they don't have as
many of the same cannabinoids and turps as
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the lemon strains are more earthy,
more cushy, different variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: different flavor, different aroma,
different buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have that arise parent in there,
but the mommy plants are so vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different that the buzz and the medicinal
or effect are going to be way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say stick with those two
lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're working for you, you don't want
to get rid of those if they're working for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the funnest part about growing is you
have more seeds and you get to hunt that
[SPEAKER_00]: next phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you get rid of one,
as long as you've got one or two that
[SPEAKER_00]: work, you've got room to get that
rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got one to play with, but I would
work with the two lemons and then maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: dark hollow and maybe a double dose
because those are vastly different from
[SPEAKER_00]: the two you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work with the two to have them in
rotation, have the other one as that
[SPEAKER_00]: third, like nighttime medicine or a switch
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what works the best for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's best for you medicinally?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what strains work the best
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your, your brain and
your body and all of that stuff require.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're trying to stay
energized all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're trying to take a
nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what you need,
but I would stick with the two you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just do auditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've got two that are reliable,
let's just pop some seeds, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if you can run some, some dark
hollows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run a couple of dark hollow seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if one of those does the magic trick
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you don't have to keep it
abandoned and you've still got those two
[SPEAKER_00]: champions right there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's my advice as a breeder,
as a grower, as somebody who's always
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the next one, I would say keep
those two reliable there and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: have that third spot as an audition spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something better beats those two,
keep the two new best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that third spot is your new audition
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to end up with lemon
Jeffrey and dark hollow and something that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't even released yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just haven't found it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just have two reliable and one that's
being an audition or always have one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like that backup rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always different from the other
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would stick with the lemon Jeffrey,
the lemon sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I keep saying it, but I feel like
dark hollow or double dose would fill in
[SPEAKER_00]: that gap very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different aroma and it's a
different buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a double dose puts out big
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the dark hollow puts out a big
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to lose any weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the lemon Jeffrey and the lemon
sunrise really put out fat harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're expecting a big fat yield
like that, you'll still keep all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back over this real quick
and make sure I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the struggle is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to decide what to grow,
not just for you, but for me, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have limited plant counts and as a
breeder who wants to do new projects and
[SPEAKER_00]: new things, I completely understand your
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I'm going to make new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you decide what you like,
I'm going to make new stuff to keep you on
[SPEAKER_00]: your toes and make the decisions hard for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You motherfucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for all of the continued
Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more email here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Tucker and
it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, how are you
brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am marvelous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing wonderfully tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I hope all is ivory,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it says, I am hoping you can answer
a few questions on IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering if you had a
recommendation for where to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predator bugs for my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predator bugs are a great way for,
uh, to manage an integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I mostly deal with the pressure
from spider mites and fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the spider mites are what I am mostly
concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to treat my veg and have an
idea of what would be best to release for
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said recently on a podcast,
you're moving away from sprays and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to follow suit as you have shown me a
great deal on things concerning IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and praises.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Ja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Ja Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and praises to Ja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about adding some beneficial,
uh, beneficial bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that was harder to say than it
looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add some beneficial bugs to your
integrated pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a lot of words there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they asked for a reputable place to
get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not paid by anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the most reliable spot for
a home grower to acquire, uh, living bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: is from Arbyco-organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends have had great
experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them a lot, but also you have to be
responsible and shop locally first if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a local insectiary that
has the bugs you need, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less time your bugs are in the mail or
on the road or in a shipping container,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more likely you are to get living
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a living product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're buying bugs that we want to come out
aggressive and hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them to come out of the box ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need them lethargic and dead from
a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, they don't need jet lag when
they get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to get them from as local of a
source as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Google, uh, put in your city and
state and then insectiary and see if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can find an insectiary that will sell
small batches to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, contact your local nurseries and
see if they are offering predator bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe if they are using predator bugs,
maybe they will add some for you to their
[SPEAKER_00]: next order.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's often a way that it happens in
smaller communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do recommend shopping locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find somewhere that is close to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't want them to have to be
shipped for too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing you do is get the
correct insect for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got fungus gnats, you want one
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got thrips, you may want
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got spider mites, you're going
to want to get a couple of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing to keep in mind is your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How dry, how humid, how hot and how cold
is your environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are going to affect how long
your pests stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you may buy thousands of predator
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may release a whole bunch of
Swarovski's, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: California's, a whole bunch of California
kiss, a whole bunch of green lace wings,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they may be hanging out for a couple
of days and they'll realize it's way too
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking cold here and they'll find ways
just to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can document your temperature and
humidity and know kind of where you stay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should know your regular temperature
and humidity in your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document that, contact your local
insectiary, let them know the pest you are
[SPEAKER_00]: facing and let them know your
environmental conditions and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: make a recommendation on the appropriate
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you tell them how much space you
are working with, square footage and
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of plants and amount of lamps,
they'll do a quick equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them will know off the top of
their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say I'm facing this much pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either moderate or heavy pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't mention cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't mention cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't tell them you're growing
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably won't ask what kind of
plants you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, you can say you're growing
hops or you can say you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very similar, but let them know
what pests you're facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you an indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have high humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them make recommendations for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, I recommend the California
kiss, the Swarovski's, hypoaspis miles,
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis, green lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a few that I could go on
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes about bugs I'm
recommending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you got some good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the insectiaries are going to have
the best advice for your region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to know what pests to
expect, and they're going to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs best eradicate those pests in your
area and what bugs survive in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Tucker, I hope I answered your
question thoroughly.

I would love to hear from you.
