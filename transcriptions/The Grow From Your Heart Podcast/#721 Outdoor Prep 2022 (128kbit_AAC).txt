[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump into
today's topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful day here in Southern
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first super nice day of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a jacket and gloves kind of
season, at least a heavy hoodie season
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not need a hoodie when I went out of
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means outdoor season is almost coming
before we get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it was my birthday today,
so I want to give a big shout out to all
[SPEAKER_00]: of my friends who sent me birthday love,
birthday messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm recording the podcast on my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big exciting Tuesday here, but we did have
a great birthday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to spend my birthday weekend with
some wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet for the very first time in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hug and high five and smoke with
our buddy Lemur Priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Lemur Priest,
the captain and commander of the Airy
[SPEAKER_00]: Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been part of the crew for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a heavy contributor to the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a bad motherfucker, a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We visited Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought his lovely partner in crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought my lovely partner in crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we were joined by the awesome Curtis
Crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Curtis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to my new friend
Lenin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time at Meow Wolf,
so I had a wonderful birthday weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: had the whole weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday spent some time with some other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday was just me and my lovely queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great birthday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to say thanks to everybody for the
birthday love, the hugs, the shout outs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fist bumps, the high fives,
the gifts, all the social media explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra thanks to anybody who spent any
moment with me on my birthday weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: on my birthday this week, whenever it's
been a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking a moment out of your day
just to spend some birthday love on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough talking about my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to talk about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the nicest, the first nice day of
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me think I better get my shit
prepared for the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I may do some outdoor stuff this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about it because I don't like
too many people knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to know what or where I'm
doing outdoors because that gives people
[SPEAKER_00]: too many opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people out there suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to keep that a little bit on
the down low until it's done and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is time for everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow outdoors in North
America, I guess if you're in other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world, you may be wrapping up
outdoors right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are, but in North
America here, it is outdoor time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get the outdoor season plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the first of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put our plants out there
probably mid May, early June, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have seeds or clones or some
sort of supply, now is the time to get on
[SPEAKER_00]: the hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start searching, start thinking about it,
start figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many things to think about
before we decide what plants to put
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, how to get them, where to get
them from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing on my note here is
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does good in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a selection for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant, a clone, a cultivar, the line,
the strain is what a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain that will work best for you in
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are going to try to focus on
hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now there are strains that are
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any because then the
breeder of that strain will get back to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, hey, you said my strain was hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that are just
popular because of social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the name and maybe a rapper
saying about it or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks nice, but it doesn't have mold
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have bug resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about more important things other
than hype, turps, potency and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that plant work in your environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't finish on time where you
are, the turps don't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not done before the first frost
comes in your area, it doesn't matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: good that plant was going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to get finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant can't handle heat or fog or
drought or humidity or whatever comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: your neighborhood, your environment
throughout that grow season, it won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive until the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't focus strictly on terpenes,
production, flavor, buzz, weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about that kind of stuff as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, that does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, the resistance,
the ability, the skills of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it survive where you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's much more important than a lot of
those other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can that plant take the... I'm not sure
where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said maybe it's going to get
drought conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Arizona, it's going to get
hot as fuck and really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're by the ocean, you're going to
get humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get air coming off of the
ocean with a lot of water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get windy environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can your plants handle the fog?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're up in the Pacific Northwest,
you're going to get different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi, different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be different wherever you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get plants that will work best for you
in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about where are we going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your anticipated space?
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about it heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have those plants out
there for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going to be a couple of
weeks to camouflage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be out there daily taking
care of them, tending them, watering them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to feed them, prune them,
twist them, lollipop them, check on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: manage bugs, manage problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be touching them every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy to be secretive about
these plants as a lot of people would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do it in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do it in the front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do it on the side of the
house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a big ass field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a big field way out in the
middle of nowhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you plan on doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think this through very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about from the day you plant it to
the day you cut it down to the day you dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it, cure it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with this plant
and the product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to harvest around Halloween
and we need to start thinking about it now
[SPEAKER_00]: in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way we win when we're
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come to the part where you're like,
Oh, it's day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do on day 50?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should know that around day 30 so you
can prepare at least be ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, where are we going to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your anticipated grow space get
enough sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get enough direct sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there light interruptions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there dark interruptions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lot of shit around there that
is going to come on lights that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come on during the night cycle and
possibly disrupt your photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lot of shit blocking the sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lot of wind there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of environment are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there animals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there intruders?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of ground do you have there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow in beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow in pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go straight in the
ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to build a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of obstacles and challenges is
your anticipated grow environment going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have regular access to this place?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think there's a hill,
a mountain that goes this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that one hill by the creek and
take a left, nobody will ever find that
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get there every single day to
apply water to those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, is that a safe place for you to
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's coming up on the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that compliant and legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to jump right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that location compliant and legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of us are going to do our own
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may grow where it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be in an illegal area, but be
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow on federal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a state park,
federal land, land owned by a lawyer or
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody prominent in the community,
you could really shoot yourself in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foot growing on that land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be even worse than just growing
in your own land, so be careful where you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, an outdoor grow must be
secured and locked up and inaccessible to
[SPEAKER_00]: thieves or children or anybody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be available to school kids or
neighborhood kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be in a greenhouse with a lock
on it where nobody can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of helps to work as thief
deterrent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be the best way to keep a
thief out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the thieves want in there, they're
going to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we're going to segue
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, let's talk about a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow cannabis illegally
or illegally, especially an outdoor crop
[SPEAKER_00]: where people can see it, things may go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you develop a
relationship with a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lawyer will become your best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to ever need them,
but it's great to have a lawyer on speed
[SPEAKER_00]: dial, a lawyer on the team, a lawyer in
the crew that's already got a bag of money
[SPEAKER_00]: with your name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you call, you go,
lawyer, this is my problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just reach into the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take out a couple of the $100 bills
or a thousand or a couple thousand dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: bills and throw it in their stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, all right, here's how you
solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just check out how much money
they've taken out of your bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you both know got a little bit of a
balance with you over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I call, there's money in your
desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to talk to me,
get a relationship with the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be 100% honest with your lawyer about what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing illegally, tell that
lawyer you're growing illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell him where, why, how, and what your
plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way he can prepare for when shit goes
wrong because there's a good chance shit
[SPEAKER_00]: could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we've got a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lawyer needs to know the details
because if there's a case built against
[SPEAKER_00]: you, whoever's building that case has
every fucking detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got aerial photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got documents from where your
phone was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got everything you've posted on
social media, all your credit card
[SPEAKER_00]: receipts, your car mileage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your GPS in your car, your OnStar,
your anti-theft piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is tracking you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're being snitched on by yourself,
by your equipment, by your technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: by your movement all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to do something,
they are building a case against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your lawyer knows every detail
of the case as well, so that he can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds sketchy, but you've got
to think about what if when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: entering this type of enterprise
environment activity, you do need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people keeping us safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the team behind the scenes,
we need them just as much as we need the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, the smokers, the breeders,
the trimmers, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyers are essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to segue into a part that I
don't like talking about, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: required when we're talking about growing
outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big ass plant outdoors,
somebody may have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you ran your mouth and told somebody
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the one person you told,
told two people, they told two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now like 17 people in your neighborhood
know they all know you got that big plan
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all know your schedule because we're
humans, we're predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do the same shit all the time,
mostly just because that's how life works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may decide to come try and remove
that plant from your grow space without
[SPEAKER_00]: your permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are dickheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are desperate, especially now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of things disrupt the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are doing dumb shit to try to stay
afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may try to come get that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're going to do when
somebody ends up in your yard trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing illegally,
my advice is just let them take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that anybody's life is worth
a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're stealing my plant from my
backyard, I am not going to shoot somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is what you choose to do,
that is what you choose to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want you right now to take a moment
and think about what am I going to do if
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody comes in that yard to steal my
ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've decided what you're going
to do, think about would a jury agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: your decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to blast somebody down
because they're stealing your ganja plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a judge and a jury may think that you have
decided that that person's life was worth
[SPEAKER_00]: less than your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to you it may be, but does the judge
and the jury agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to ever come to that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really truly don't, but that is
something we must think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may try to steal your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to protect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to deal with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then down the line, how are you going to
deal with this for the next five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you protect your crop, this could be a
legal case that could cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that before the plant goes
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going to deal with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people in America are gun happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got a gun since the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's ready to protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready to bring that out and
protect your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't shoot somebody for weed plants
in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went back there, I don't have weed
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the fucking city.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbors could just fucking reach over
and take anything they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they wouldn't shout out guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, but they would see the ganja
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd throw a fucking fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the fucking city and shit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they were out there and you tried
to steal them, I'd just say, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, don't fucking hurt the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shoot any dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck up the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get what you need and get out of
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd basically be my approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm in the city and somebody will,
will steal my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think now what you might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go on too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward because I don't want to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is, is hitting somebody worth your
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is shooting somebody worth your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is you've got to think about it now
because I don't want you to be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: position and have to panic and think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of thing when it comes to
defense, tactical strategy, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking way ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something a little bit
more lighthearted, a little bit less
[SPEAKER_00]: creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our whole goal is to grow weed outdoors
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to produce an outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got free sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we got an environment out there that
is probably ideal for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to prepare,
prepare for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your main strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow organically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow with salt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, are you going to grow
in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow in a raised bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you digging holes and going straight
into the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you plan to amend the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you plan to just water every day and
put bottled nutrients into there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to think about is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get water to your
grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people may think they're going to
grow out there on that plot of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their uncle left him a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the dirt out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the soil out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, is there access to
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a truck you can load up enough
water to take out there as frequently as
[SPEAKER_00]: needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a place you can get that
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have that much water out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is a big thing to think about that
people really overlook when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing for an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most essential things,
but you don't think you don't realize how
[SPEAKER_00]: much water that plan is going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow crazy fast outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get real tall,
real bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get 100 degrees out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to drink a lot of
water depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Earth is real rocky, if it's real
damp, they may need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need less water, but they're
going to get thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a big thing to think about,
and maybe I should have talked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, but what is your budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of budget do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a budget to buy a bunch of
nutrients to amend the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a budget for really good
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a budget for all of the stuff
you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want a shoestring budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your budget wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have good genetics to start
with, you cannot meet the goals you are
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start with good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the correct genetics in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need good genes, whether that's
clones or seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a lot more about that
in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would recommend getting that soil
amended well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got all of the things you need
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend investing in a couple of top
dresses for later on in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you allocate a little bit of
that budget for pest management and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: deterrent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got deer or bunny or bear or
fucking something else wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to allocate part of
the budget to mitigating damage from
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a helper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need somebody to help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to pay them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck your helpers over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know so many friendships, relationships,
bro ships, bromances that are fucking dead
[SPEAKER_00]: because people have built grows together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy had land.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy had plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy had an idea and they all said
at the end of this, we'll split it up
[SPEAKER_00]: three ways and we'll all win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy took all the shit and now two
people are mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two people talk shit about guy
number three every time they get a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy number three doesn't have any fucking
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit goes weird when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friendships over growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is to unite us, to unify us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck your friends over if you hire
them to grow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dickhead to the trimmers
because without them, your product looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love and respect all the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the budget figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about security?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do for security?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about your plan for the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do to keep that
gross safe and secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that I can recommend
for keeping a gross safe and secure is to
[SPEAKER_00]: shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nobody knows about it, nobody can steal
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody needs to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your best friend doesn't need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your girlfriend doesn't need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That girl you brought over that one night
doesn't need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude from the dispensary doesn't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your friend at work doesn't need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody needs to know but you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way nobody's mooching off you when
it's harvest time also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody needs to know about that plan out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can see it, there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it where nobody can see it because
seeing that plan invites thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are not thieves until you
wave some shit in front of their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go, hey look, 10 foot tall weed
plant, free weed, free weed, free weed for
[SPEAKER_00]: a week, for two weeks, for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just watching it get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the fourth week,
a motherfucker is going to jump a fence
[SPEAKER_00]: and get your weed and you're just taunting
them at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your shit safe, protected,
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be smart about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that say nobody's going to
jump this fence and get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck neighborhood do you live in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to jump that fence and
get that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other way because of where I'm
from, where I was raised, that shit's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave something outside where I'm
from, that's just like saying it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just putting a fucking free sign on
it where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step up your security, get your shit
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind booby traps are illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys set up a booby trap to protect
your grow and somebody gets hurt,
[SPEAKER_00]: you did commit a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be charged with the original
cannabis crime and an assault charge and a
[SPEAKER_00]: booby trap charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also if law enforcement were to stumble
into that booby trap, that's an extra
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe some people don't care
about the rules and laws, but keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, booby traps are an extra crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get an extra trouble for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where are we going from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got some of the most important
part is going to start coming up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males and females and tested cuts is what
I've got written on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, at the end of the grow season
and the middle of the grow season,
[SPEAKER_00]: I start seeing people post really
heartbreaking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people posting six foot tall,
10 foot tall plants that are as big around
[SPEAKER_00]: as a Volkswagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're super bummed out because they
just found out that that boy is either
[SPEAKER_00]: interest or that that plan is either a boy
or an intersex plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is easily, easily preventable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to this is don't run untested cuts
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put some shit outside that you did
not run indoors one time and establish
[SPEAKER_00]: what that plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it intersex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a mutant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a total piece of shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put plants outside until you know
what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that it can be challenging
to acquire or obtain seeds or clones or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to grow this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be in a place where there's
limited or minimal or maybe no access,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still you've got to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a male plant outside and you
don't know it's a male plant, that male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant could flower and pollinate every
crop for miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I am in the city of Pueblo,
Colorado, we've got a lot of grows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also many commercial grow
facilities just a few miles from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got outdoor grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of us busted out a male plant and
let it just full on skeet pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere for a week, we would ruin
crops, not just a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would ruin crops of crops around here
and that is a dick move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy to let a male plant go
and ruin everybody else's crop because you
[SPEAKER_00]: are not a responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard to get the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I started with, but maybe you
can trust your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can trust your dispensary,
but nobody ever says, hey, I might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says, no, I'm clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: One day you find out you got some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does the same thing with their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a clone and they go,
bro, my garden's the fucking cleanest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that boast and brag the most
about having the cleanest garden generally
[SPEAKER_00]: have the worst fucking problems is what
I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful where you get your clones
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they come from a dispensary,
if they come from a friend, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: expect them to have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect them to have spider mites,
fungus gnats, thrips, something of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your job to treat those incoming
plants for those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now the gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your job, your duty, your
responsibility to get this crop from
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to end successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your only goal as the farmer is to
harvest a successful, smokable,
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to get the plants and it is
now your job to treat them for bugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: for mildew and make sure that these
problems don't expand if they do come with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you get these plants,
if you get seeds or plants, or clones is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm trying to say, I would test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm saying get them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is March.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would give us time to at least sex
test our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run a small plant indoors and if
you put it under 12 hours of lighting or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 12 on and 12 off in about 10 to 14
days, that plant will show you if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: male or a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put the boys outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cull them, chop them down, throw them
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only put female plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely do a sex test before you put
things outside because like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want that male plant out there
ruining everybody's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something else to think about is that
clone may have been tested by your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have been ran by your friend,
but do you trust their selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow from seed indoors,
make my selections, then put those
[SPEAKER_00]: selections outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first run with the plant shouldn't be
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not all of us have an
indoor setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't all get plants and clones and
test them, but ideally you would get a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds, do a pheno hunt indoors,
find the good one, then put it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the important things I want to
get to is maybe that clone that you got
[SPEAKER_00]: from your friend was awesome in his indoor
grow or in her indoor grow or maybe in his
[SPEAKER_00]: or her indoor grow or outdoor grow in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where are you outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that plant that was selected in
NorCal won't do the best in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something that was selected in
Jamaica and grew amazingly there won't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as well in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something that grows really well in
upstate New York won't grow as well here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different environments,
different environments is basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: different parameters, which these plants
have to survive through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the plants that work best in your
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find an outdoor grower who's
been growing in your area for generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: they probably have the plants that work
the best for them, for you in that area,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that around the middle of
August, it's going to get real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as September goes on,
it starts to get real damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by October, it gets foggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to know the shit to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know the day it's going to snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they know that this plant will
finish right before the snow usually
[SPEAKER_00]: comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those local growers
and see what they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for just hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy shit just for hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, it's got to be able
to take temperature swings, bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, heat, dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to handle a lot of shit outdoors
that it never got shown indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're getting clones that
are good for the outdoors, not just for an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to buy a pack of seeds,
I highly recommend you get, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend if you're going to go straight
outdoors, I would definitely recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will eliminate the opportunity for
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do still have to keep a close eye on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There still is the opportunity for
intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get problems, mutants,
freaks, still pay attention, but it will
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the chances in half of finding a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cut the chances, probably 99% of
finding a boy is what I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a 50-50 chance of getting boys in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just cut that part right out of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to get the seeds,
you're going to grow them outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely sex test them before
you put them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just run them outside because then
you're going to be heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you do grow them outside,
grow extra and pay very close attention
[SPEAKER_00]: and look for the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, you've got a 50%
chance of regular seed being a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay very close attention to those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do grow outside if you did not sex
test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen, chuckers, all of you beautiful
