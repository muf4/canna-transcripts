[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to focus with Chris
Farley flipping up his shades and just
[SPEAKER_01]: staring at me over and over again,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have forgotten how much I miss that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Adam Sandler closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dredged up a lot of feels I didn't
know I still had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot how much I miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss his comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are probably wondering why we're
starting the podcast like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got the iPad sitting on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a random gift comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to read a comment that's
right above this and Chris Farley is here
[SPEAKER_01]: just flipping up his shades and popping
the shades, just looking at us with that
[SPEAKER_01]: face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine he sees booty with that face
he's making.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sees booty.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking up, lifting up them shades
like, dang, look at that booty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the that's not this kind of beach,
but I appreciate it face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see like a car wash happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we could probably press pause
and we could probably see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: reflection of those cool sunglasses what
he's actually looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for episode three ninety six of
the Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our podcast sitting across the table from
me is one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming out, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cold out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brutal cold in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold and dry is exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lips feel the dry just from being out
there for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you came in, I felt a like a popsicle
trail just follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it felt like the Grim Reaper was
walking behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just brought in a trail of cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you took off your jacket,
cold came off of your jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, damn, son, it is nasty cold
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look nice today, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's southern Colorado living.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be 70 tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows with what we've got going on
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll quit talking about the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a damn podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick weather update for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grow from your weather with Rasta,
Jeff and Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
show is brought to you by Oregon Elite
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to add fresh genetics to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do so by visiting
OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a tradition that we start the
podcast off by talking about what we are
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been dabbing more of that gelato cake
batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're getting really weird today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to this sound right here,
give me just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me smoking a bowl of delicious
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've seen you hit a pipe
since the day we went legal and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reporters were here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good memory to bring up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave Mike a little bit of a dab early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched it just destroy his lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He coughed for several minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fighting kind of a head cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to kill him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I packed up a bowl of some delicious
flours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cold, dry weather we shouldn't have
brought up earlier is making it terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bit of that weed in my
mouth, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flours we are smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to somebody who
grew some amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it tasty, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is it's called Zookies and it's grown
by our friend Golden Growers One.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Golden Growers One.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good herb, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the flavor that's lingering on my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hit it again if I really want to
get the effects of what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get your herpacifalitis,
am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hope not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the fire's for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to the forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's forehead high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like in my third eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my third eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys feel that in your third eye?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you woke from smoking that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I said the right number at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a previous episode, we brought up the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a bong hit and you leave some
smoke in the bong, what is that stale
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke that's left in the bong called?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Mike's realm, I want you to say what
you call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call that shit in your realm?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a buffalo fart is the term I've
always heard to describe leaving smoke in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one sent me anything saying it was
different for a rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: A buffalo fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting, especially from
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not something that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mike, what would you call this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Buffalo fart, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really not like your regular
vernacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not out of my wheelhouse at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally random for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that to be one of your terms is kind
of strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my hood, in my smoking circle where I'm
from here, we called it rebong,
[SPEAKER_01]: that old funky smoke left in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked you guys to tweet at us and let us
know what you call that stale smoke that
[SPEAKER_01]: is left over in the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a fat bong rip and there's
still some gunk left in there when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: done, what do you call that nasty smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got one great reply from our friends on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This reply came from my friend Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see you, good to hear from
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, if I'm at home, I call it wasted
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a situation where I took my first
dab, I was a little scared of clearing the
[SPEAKER_01]: dab after watching the guy pass clean the
eff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies for wasting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasted medicine is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you all right over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You drooled a little bit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going in on that cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not even the right color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to recap on what Aldridge
said because Mike was trying to steal the
[SPEAKER_01]: thunder by coughing over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm checking YouTube comments badly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you were just disruptive today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to leave that in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear myself over myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aldridge said, I call it wasted cannabis,
but he was in a situation where he took
[SPEAKER_01]: his first dab, and he was scared to clear
it because I was there when Aldridge took
[SPEAKER_01]: his first dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually gave him his first dab,
and we did it at the dab lounge in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he's talking about is moments before
I gave him his first dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting all set up at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a dab scooped up for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to give him a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that he's nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's telling me, bro, I'm so nervous to
take my first dab, and I'm trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: him feel comfortable and calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I hear this noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody can't hear that through the
mics, it was a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just collapsing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took a dab, and they just fucking
fell right over onto the table and knocked
[SPEAKER_01]: glass off of the table, cleaned off the
table, anything like drinks and pipes and
[SPEAKER_01]: bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could hear it all smash onto the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't sound pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me being a very experienced consumer and
somebody who wants to mind my own
[SPEAKER_01]: business, I just sat there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat right in the seat where I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aldridge did decide to get up and go see
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, did that dude pass clean the
fuck out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, cool, sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell he was like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want to be fucking fatality
number two that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a little bit scared, but bro,
you did a really good job with your first
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like such a noob.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a dabber now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's funny that you were so
nervous to take your first dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just great timing that that
dude passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said clean the eff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you don't have to apologize for
wasting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was less than a half a dab that you
didn't consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I'd rather you not smoke that
whole thing than watch you get all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the don't waste it mentality
that was so prevalent when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just sort of outgrew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a certain point, you'd rather your
friend not overdo it rather than see that
[SPEAKER_00]: half a hit get blown into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now it's not six of us pitching on a
dime bag and everybody trying to get as
[SPEAKER_01]: high as we can off of fucking three
joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's six of us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got several grams over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a dab, and you choke and blow
it up into the air, that's one for the
[SPEAKER_01]: dead homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too stressed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew there was a YouTube submission for
an answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam on YouTube says it's called mommy's
milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always finish your mommy's
milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely go with mothers rather
than mommies if I was going to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: term, but I got to say I prefer buffalo
fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the first time I'm going to
say that buffalo fart wins that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a terrible term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you compare it to the alternative,
I'm going to stick with rebond,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because that's what we've always said
in my circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet if we went rebond, it's pretty
good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a solid term.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we went back to where we used to go
smoke back over at, uh, at the red room
[SPEAKER_01]: and we pulled out the bong, man,
I wonder how many people just got
[SPEAKER_01]: flashbacks of the red room and somebody
said buffalo fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would know what we meant,
but if we said clear your rebond,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody would know exactly what we meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I hadn't heard buffalo fart in
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about a year ago, we were in a room
with a group of people in the afternoon
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the people in the room was sort
of famous for not being able to hit a bomb
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to draw through the bowl and
into the bong repeatedly taking like sip
[SPEAKER_00]: hits off the top of the, you know,
but taking sip hits off the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bong while continuously pulling more and
more smoke into the, the apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'd hand it off with like
nine, um, sipped hits taken off of it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge cloud still inside it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day I made the mistake of just
clearing it normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was hacking a coffin,
somebody was like, dude, you never suck a
[SPEAKER_00]: buffalo fart out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I about died because I hadn't heard
the term in a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suck a buffalo fart out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just makes it way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's part of where the term came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, buffalo fart should be blown out,
not sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes different when you say it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike had a couple of technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've stuttered a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put this podcast back on the adult
rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to say adult rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like we're about to do
something even extra fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it back on a normal track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I invited you to the show because
there is a new bill coming forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is bill four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set a bill for 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell me and my audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: My audience and myself, the audience and
myself, our audience and the listeners and
[SPEAKER_01]: I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dear listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set a bill for 20 is a federal
decriminalization bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're describing it as a bill to
federally decriminalize, regulate and tax
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gone ahead and reserved the name S
period for 20 or Senate bill for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senators can go ahead and reserve a number
for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like last year, they used S for 20 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was 2018 S for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2019 S for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matching legislation has been submitted to
the House of Representatives under a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different number, but they had
submitted to both houses when they do
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually three bills for 20,
for 21 and for 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to pull the the
language of the bill and read it for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the package of legislation was filed
by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon on February
[SPEAKER_00]: 7th of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seeks to update tax law by providing
for the taxation and regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana products and for other purposes,
basically banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill is officially called the
Marijuana Revenue and Regulation Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the article I'm skimming comments
on the number for 20 honors the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shake my head when they use for 20 and
710 for stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's the cop show where the
cop is insisting on using the street name
[SPEAKER_00]: in the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you look insane when you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just my personal take.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't like it when the cops call it
the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's cringe worthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just no, don't when you can avoid it,
avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But listeners, I don't think any of you
are going to submit federal legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know why I'm ranting about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of my tangents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going with the for 20 representative for
the House of Representatives, Earl
[SPEAKER_00]: Blummeyer has reserved H.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: for 20 for a House bill that will do
similar things, mainly for Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this as for 20 widens bill is part of
a legislative package that would lay the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for responsible, comprehensive
federal regulation of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to a statement from the senator
who serves on the Senate's Committee on
[SPEAKER_00]: Finance.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of the package, Blummeyer filed an
identical piece of legislation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: House which is called H.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 1, 2, 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the companion bill to S420.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, this package of
bills includes S421 and S422.
[SPEAKER_00]: The former would aim to shrink the gap
between federal and state marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: policies, and the latter aims to treat
marijuana businesses like any other small
[SPEAKER_00]: business when it comes to their tax bills,
which means the end of 280E or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 280E's application to state legal
marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the industry, you know how
big that could be for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, this bill is in its infancy,
and given all of the shenanigans at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government level recently,
who knows how smooth this process is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, listeners, if you haven't been
following marijuana politics as closely as
[SPEAKER_00]: I have for the last decade, every year at
least one or two senators get together and
[SPEAKER_00]: submit a bill like this, and 10 times out
of 10, it goes nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dies in committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never hear about it after the initial
press release saying, there's a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's its funny number, and then it's
going to committee next week, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all you ever hear because it dies
in committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more hope now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going into another presidential
election this next round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can decide if we keep Trump or pick
anybody else, and along with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like this is going to get a lot more
national attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump's White House has played the
marijuana question a lot different than
[SPEAKER_00]: their predecessors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprise, surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that that's a good or a bad thing,
yet we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bananas thing about the Trump
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to tell if they're going
left, right, or forward on any issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea if they're anti-cannabis,
pro-cannabis, or ignoring cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see the White House support one
of the several federal pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation that would either deregulate
cannabis federally, reschedule it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or let states expand their existing
programs if they've legalized it already
[SPEAKER_00]: at the state level or at changes to
banking bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see the White House get behind
any of those or none of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up in the air question at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, the White House stays out
of anything marijuana related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just prefer not to take a stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're pressed, they say,
we're waiting for Congress to act.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tall order right now,
but waiting for Congress to act is what
[SPEAKER_00]: this bill would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the next steps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who can approve or veto this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next chain of command?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the next two or three steps in
the chain of command?
[SPEAKER_00]: This bill goes to committee first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The committee digs through and looks to
see, does the Senate have the authority to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate and legislate stuff like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: They debate the merits of the bill
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they debate the optics of the
bill or don't debate it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just never comes up for discussion in
committee and dies there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to clear that dab since your
lungs have already collapsed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and fill that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several more steps here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut you off because you've
already given myself and the listeners the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that there are several steps and
several opportunities for this to just get
[SPEAKER_01]: nixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could completely be something we
talked about and didn't come to any
[SPEAKER_01]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're choking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to ramble just like you
do for me when I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I want to know is what kind
of timeline do we have before we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start seeing progress of this moving
forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of timeline?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does get shot down, is that going to
be in a month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be in three months?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are we going to know if this
actually gets approved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry listeners, in three to six months,
we'll know if this specific bill is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to move forward in any meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The likelihood of that is very,
very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it gets shot down, is that like a
game over or can they go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: drawing board, cross a few words out,
reinsert a few words and bring it back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that done for the year at that
point?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, there's really no bringing
back this version of the bill this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's several other bills that
do very similar things in similar ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that have already been submitted or will
be submitted later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned one earlier out of Oregon and
Rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blumeyer's office, I think is sponsoring
it, that's getting submitted through the
[SPEAKER_00]: House of Representatives first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We at least have a backup plan if this
does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like this is the first time
this has ever happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens every year and has for eight
or 10 or 15 years in a row now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upside is we've done this before with
other things where the feds say one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and the states slowly one by one go,
no, we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at a certain point, usually when you
get to about 30, 35 states in disagreement
[SPEAKER_00]: with the feds, the feds are forced to
really reexamine their position and decide
[SPEAKER_00]: if they did with raising the alcohol or
the drinking age to 21, if they really
[SPEAKER_00]: start making threats to bring states in
line, or if they do with so many other
[SPEAKER_00]: things where they go, you know what,
our policy is out of alignment with the
[SPEAKER_00]: views of the American public and federal
policy finally gets changed because so
[SPEAKER_00]: many states have taken that step first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're sort of reaching traditional
tipping point numbers now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if you look at federal
action on medical marijuana stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: they told us to go fuck ourselves from
1970 till 2014, 2013 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, they started saying,
okay, maybe some of you have a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start allowing more people to do the
medical research, to look for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA finally called uncle for the first
time in 60 years and said they'll open up
[SPEAKER_00]: more production facilities other than just
the University of Mississippi for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: product for these tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way you kind of set me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this set up as one of my later on
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think if this does go through,
that this will be the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: end?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people in a lot of other
places are going to say it's already the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the end, but the beginning of
the end of any medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have a national decriminalized
cannabis program, do you think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start destroying medical
marijuana programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and no.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know now is sort of horrible,
not to be over dramatic or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you look at all traditional forms
of medicine and it's not just like big
[SPEAKER_00]: pharma pills, but all medicine,
whether it's splinting a broken bone or
[SPEAKER_00]: healing a cut or stitches, all medicine
goes through a specific process and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were forced to go outside of the
traditional processes for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the reason we had to build
our own testing labs, infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit was because we can't use the labs
that test literally every other product on
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that's going to go away and we'll
be able to use the infrastructure that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have now, we get expanded
drastically, is the research into other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids really explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I don't know any THCV or CBG or
CBC breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start to see the emergence
of people focusing on lots of stuff we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see now as this expands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Random note, you know where the THCV has
been commonly found?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, from what I understand,
it is in the African land race strains
[SPEAKER_01]: such as Durban poison, also in the double
dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes through in the double dragon if
you lab test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the THCV from the Durban,
so a lot of the African land races are
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember how much the breeding and
the genetics game changed when people like
[SPEAKER_00]: you and me got access to labs?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's around the same time that everybody
went CBD crazy, so yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the same thing on a
much grander scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watching it with the hemp game right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do a whole episode on hemp testing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two cases going on right now where
people were shipping hemp and got in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other podcasts that have been
covering those pretty well, so I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: delved into them because I feel like
they've been covered, but if you ever want
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about it, you bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on a massive ramp, but I want
to stay kind of close to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: With medical anyway, we've seen quite a
bit of federal action that they've just
[SPEAKER_00]: been adamant not to do for the last 50 or
60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an outsider's perspective that
doesn't watch this stuff as closely,
[SPEAKER_00]: the action we've seen federally seems
pretty minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steps the feds have taken have all
been super baby step, and it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of sense if you don't follow this
stuff really closely because until very
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, we just had no progress for
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: We beat these fuckers in court in 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year I was born, the feds got taken to
court in the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rigged the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had their own law judge, a DEA law
judge, was the judge for the case and
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up ruling in our favor saying
cannabis is clearly, by all evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: presented, remarkably medically active and
remarkably safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ruling eventually led to the creation
of the federal medical marijuana program
[SPEAKER_00]: where they send pot to patients,
which is a whole other episode as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've won in court, in federal court with
their own ringer judge is the decider,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've still seen zero action until
very, very recently when the feds have
[SPEAKER_00]: started to really move on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a lot more
progress over the next few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's assuming a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really never know where our wonderful
president is going to drive this bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you said earlier that I think we
should clear up for listeners is what is
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between decriminalization
and legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so decriminalization, the short
version is end market consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: so people that just smoke weed some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get taken out of the legal system for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still illegal to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still illegal to have a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely still illegal to sell some
to your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the cop says, hey, what are you
doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing they can get you for is
has a small personal amount of weed with
[SPEAKER_00]: them currently, then you don't get in
trouble legally the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without going to full legalization,
you can't have things like storefronts or
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning laws or taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big difference between those
two policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, because you brought this up,
the anti-pot community has realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: we should prohibit this is no longer an
effective argument and no one listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as soon as they start talking
about arresting users, and full on
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition like we've traditionally had
with cannabis, people laugh at them and go
[SPEAKER_00]: away and completely stop listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've started pretending that
they're decriminalization advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to see users go to jail,
which they don't think happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't want it to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pretend to be decriminalization
advocates, which is weird because Vermont
[SPEAKER_00]: basically did decriminalization last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early last year, I think, through the
legislature, Vermont legalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they legalized without any
infrastructure or commercial industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you're allowed to grow a couple
of plants at home and keep what you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and maybe share it with an adult
friend who comes to your house and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: leave with a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and big up there in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're working on... It was the
first attempt at a legislature to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize, and they had a bunch of anti-pot
people flood the state at the last minute
[SPEAKER_00]: and really fear monger pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got their governor to back off
from a commercial industry to just a
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the anti-pot community didn't get
behind that decriminalization model at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bitched about the loss in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six months later, when Vermont
started talking about doing the full
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial industry and full legalization,
they came out again and were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this model you've got now is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you expand it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, you can't be both.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best things I see coming out of
this so far is the opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that we lack in
this industry.
It's so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's independent banking legislation
that just had a hearing this week that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks to dial back to ADE's impact on
legal cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our elected officials are really starting
to understand that insisting an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that does six to 10 billion in business a
year operate as cash only is not a smart
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to be able to easily confirm
that a business is operating on the up and
[SPEAKER_00]: up, operating as a cash only business
makes that a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paying the right amount of taxes,
the payroll, and it makes you a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: target for thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes with federal regulation is
the banking and tracking the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that they're going to let us
claim the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sure they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to happen eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much money in that industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are folks like you and I who,
when we worked for the grow where we
[SPEAKER_01]: worked, we may go to places and try to
apply for credit for a new car or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: we were trying to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd say, where do you work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, I throw out the doing
business as name, their development name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd say, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, it's a dispensary grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd go, yeah, we don't give loans
to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy a car from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this bill does pass and we can work
with the banks, people that have worked in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry that are working hard,
they're working as managers, as
[SPEAKER_01]: consultants, they're working as
representatives for companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing real legitimate jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can actually go and get loans for
houses and pay their bills legitimately
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be really advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did not like as an employee
having to take an envelope full of cash to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brief every other Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I was kind of in a weird
situation where I was working at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary when the bank representative
came in and begged for our employee
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, when I'd go to take my
paycheck, the teller would see the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: stack of 10s and 20s and go, oh,
I don't want to want to know where this is
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every payday, I had to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there are people that aren't
like, I'm a fairly large human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 6'3", 250 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big person.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't often bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I worked with a lot of 5'2",
101 pound female coworkers who were also
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving late at night with a huge envelope
of cash in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a tenable system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is untenable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a place, another place,
which we worked together, that only paid
[SPEAKER_01]: us every two weeks in cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20s, because they kept all the 100s and
50s for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 10s more often than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I get all the 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a few rungs up the ladder for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But us lowly level service and customer
service people were getting paid in 20s
[SPEAKER_00]: and 10s more often than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you show up with two weeks worth
of pay in a moderate rate and you hand
[SPEAKER_00]: that to a bank teller, they got fucking
questions because the only other people
[SPEAKER_00]: that come in with all 10s are selling $10
crack bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to explain, oh no,
it's just my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cash only store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't pay me with a check because
it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And banks won't work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please help me launder this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cynical of me to think this,
but I think the anti-pot crowd fights
[SPEAKER_00]: banking access so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim it's because they're afraid
Marlboro is going to invest in our company
[SPEAKER_00]: you and me start and take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big tobacco is going to take it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think it's because if you
took the huge piles of cash out of the gun
[SPEAKER_00]: safes, the infrequent dispensary robberies
would become even more infrequent and they
[SPEAKER_00]: would lose the talking point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's why they fight so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good argument there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we pay reasonable federal
taxes and are allowed to deposit our
[SPEAKER_00]: proceeds in the bank, that doesn't
automatically mean anything other than the
[SPEAKER_00]: business is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretend like we're going to get huge
angel investors from evil corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I thought we were evil on
our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need them?
[SPEAKER_01]: The storefronts are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing business.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are employed by the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's commerce to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's making money by being there all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That person is going to buy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to buy food in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they get a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably live within 10 or 15
minutes, maybe 20 minute drive away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're paying rent in that community
with the money they make at that
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are shopping there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money's coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money's going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's contributing to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, as far as everything else is
concerned, our cannabis industry is just
[SPEAKER_00]: like our ice cream industry or our
newspaper industry or our sneaker
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the same until it comes to
how they handle payments in and payment
[SPEAKER_00]: out and what they do with the money after
it shows up at the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this does pass, is there a business
model in mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to follow the Colorado
regulation and regulate alcohol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do they have a different idea that
you've read so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal legislation just removes the
federal laws against it and allows states
[SPEAKER_00]: to do their own thing like they have with
booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi can decide to be the Utah of
weed and do state run stores, state run
[SPEAKER_00]: rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the state profits from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dial down potency or put in purchase
limits however they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other states can go full bore and say
you can buy as much as you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it lets each state kind of hammer
it out for themselves for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like we do with most stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that got my attention is it's
called the Cannabis Revenue Act or the
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Revenue Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's got money involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds are starting to get pressure from
lawmakers where there's a rumor out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world that I see on a lot of anti-pot
forms and a lot of uninformed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions where they say the feds can't
collect cannabis taxes or federal taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis businesses because they're
illegally federal, which is fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal businesses still have to pay
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a full on criminal enterprise,
they typically don't, which is how Al
[SPEAKER_00]: Capone got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that law was already on the books when
Al Capone got busted and is still very
[SPEAKER_00]: much in play today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where 280E comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if you run an illegal fucking
business, you can't take federal tax
[SPEAKER_00]: deductions like any other business would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why 280E is so impactful to the
legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal in the state, but it's not
illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get triple fucked on taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay almost 70% in taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not after we've hit the $10 million
mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clarify that because that sounds egregious
and like hyperbole, but explain who is
[SPEAKER_01]: paying that 70% in taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The business owner, the business itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out of the sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to use real numbers, Colorado sold just
over a billion dollars worth of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to end up being like 1.4,
but we're around to a billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't visualize a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like 600 million of that or more,
650 million of that was taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remainder, the 350 million left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the industry used to keep the
lights on, to do payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the owners profited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state takes 15% off the top for
excise when the cannabis is produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's grown in one facility,
then it's got to be taken to a retail
[SPEAKER_01]: location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two separate entities,
two separate environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it moves in the computer,
15% taxes.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When 15% for excise, there's a special
cannabis tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a local sales tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already we're at 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different little small
taxes that bring the state up to like 33
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half percent or something like that,
depending on which part of the state
[SPEAKER_00]: you're standing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then federal taxes that everybody pays
usually come in around 20, 22% because
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis businesses aren't allowed to
deduct payroll, inventory, a number of
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal businesses deduct, like
normally if your business buys new chairs
[SPEAKER_00]: for the office, that gets deducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take any deductions,
which brings their federal tax to 32 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 33%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pueblo County, most of the businesses
are paying 67% in taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each dollar they get, 67 cents gets
taken out of that dollar and divvied up to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to taxes somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the feds are collecting their share of
this money and it's starting to be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimates last year for legal cannabis
sales were like seven to 10 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of fucking money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the feds are taking 30% of that,
eventually somebody's going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you call them drug dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking your cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes you part of the game in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're definitely at least condoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you came on my turf and you sold a
hundred dollars worth of your drug of
[SPEAKER_01]: choice, it's just a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you stepped on my turf and you sold a
hundred dollars worth of product,
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked up to you and said, Hey,
I'm going to beat the shit out of you and
[SPEAKER_01]: take all a hundred, or you just want to
give me 10 bucks every time you sell a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred, you'd give me 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now part of your crime, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taxing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is hood tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, if the cops discovered this,
you'd get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically what the feds are
doing is they're demanding legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, not only pay federal taxes,
but pay inflated federal taxes because of
[SPEAKER_00]: 280 E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time they go, we
appreciate you paying your taxes in a
[SPEAKER_00]: timely manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apologize for charging you an extra fee
because you paid in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also these DEA agents, if they ever get
bored, they're going to come fuck your
[SPEAKER_00]: life up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take everything you've
owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to break everything you've
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to shoot your fucking dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to tell you it's
your fault, throw you in jail for six
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all that's over, they're not going to
get around to charging you because the
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecutor knows the jury in your area
will be pissed that they were called for
[SPEAKER_00]: jury duty over a fucking weed store that
the state said was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done this before in a couple of
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually that fucked up situation is
going to come to a head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're headed there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I ran a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the first dispensary in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was other folks and us ran the very
first dispensary within city limits here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We paid a very large number in tax
dollars, a large number, a small car,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good car.
[SPEAKER_01]: We paid what my car is worth in taxes and
one tax payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a fun meeting at one point with
the city where I brought that up a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times in a really snarky, hey,
fuck all you kind of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the person's name and I
remember his response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city councilman joked that the checks
in the mail, they'll send that shit back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the city manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: If looks could kill rated Ray would have
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city manager was like, no fucking cash
and spent bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell them we'll send it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never sent it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they took that, what that car,
that car worth of tax payment and less
[SPEAKER_01]: than a week later walked in with cease and
desist letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can no longer do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they were happy to take that tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money then then in the trial, just like
Mike said, we're like, well, what about
[SPEAKER_01]: all the tax money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got to play ball for a little while,
but at a certain point there has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough elected officials now that
understand that the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is far preferable to the black
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you go ahead and believe all the
crazy shit people say cannabis does,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you buy into all of that,
it's still more beneficial for society to
[SPEAKER_00]: have it sold in a storefront than it is on
a street corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want herb and it's something that
we can produce at home or in all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we can produce it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is going to be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not make a few bucks off of it and
stop putting people in jail?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll clean out some jail space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll free up some Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are like 6,000 or 6,500 people
a year are not getting arrested for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only, I've said this before,
but the only thing I ever did that was
[SPEAKER_01]: really illegal or criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was younger, I was a
fucking shit head, but now that as I'm an
[SPEAKER_00]: adult, but like random teenage vandalism
doesn't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the only thing I had to worry about
was having cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only thing that I did as an
adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only crime I break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I would drive like a complete
fucking asshole, but most of the time I
[SPEAKER_01]: just had cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's not really a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I didn't do the two things at
once because of the don't break bone of my
[SPEAKER_01]: white Mike's rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't break two laws at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that I don't, I have to worry
about having my personal bag of weed or my
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs or whatever with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I feel so, it's so chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only thing I did that was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no longer a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am an upstanding citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel weird when I get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rolled down the window and I smiled at
the cop like, yeah, I was going real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like instead of, oh shit, is he going to
fuck my life up for this little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in my bag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to go to jail for however many
days because I got two grams of herb and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little one hitter in my backpack or a
dirty pipe in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got, uh, in a safe area in the
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, my car doesn't have a trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to put my stuff in another
container and then put that out of reach,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, as far as I can get it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is obvious that I'm not trying to
consume that product, but I do carry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my dab rig in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got multiple fucking layers of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it in a cooler with some ice packs
in there so that my concentrates don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, then when you get to wherever you're
going, the rig water is not all warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever pulled out the rig in the summer
and you go to take a dab and the water is
[SPEAKER_01]: just steamy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rig's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: My rig's been in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is one day I had the e-nail on
and our boy Sloppy came over and went to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just evaporated the water and he hit a
dry e-nail dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, Slop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still, still sorry for that one,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that episode 100?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a podcast happening when that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like right before episode 100 or
that was on episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might've been a hundred or yeah,
it had to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he was probably here for a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the garbage garden of Weeden
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the crowd and he was over here at
the secondary table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy and Joe, which was funny cause
Sloppy Joe were sitting over there at the
[SPEAKER_01]: small secondary table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shy kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it when we ramble, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I got you out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm glad I got out of the house too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say we seem to have shaken
your mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having one of them days folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just call me Grover.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bowl's loaded up bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit that whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have another coughing fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs are so fried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was real mean to them today listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke cigarettes also, which is
terrible for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cigarettes are not helping,
but the in and out of wet and hot air to
[SPEAKER_00]: cold and dry air repeatedly is just
killing my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a big mouth reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for the good report on SB
420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any things that I did not let
you cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that covers most of the federal action
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeners, let me know what you want me to
rant about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me.

Facebook.

[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, well, Mike,

[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell everybody how we can
find you and how you just jumped the gun
[SPEAKER_01]: and good job, bro.

to help kick this can further down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road, you can email or otherwise contact
your elected representative and tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: to support federal action on cannabis
reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be super specific about SB 420,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many of these get submitted
and go nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully this one goes somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, we at least talked about it a
little bit here on the show and told
[SPEAKER_01]: people what's going on.
