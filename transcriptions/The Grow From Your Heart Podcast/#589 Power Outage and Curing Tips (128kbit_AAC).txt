[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and it is time for episode 589 of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of cake face
batter from Binsk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, this tastes like diesel
fuel and cake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you went and got some diesel fuel
in the truck, drove home, whipped up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little cake batter, and then smelled your
fingers, it would taste like a sweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel-fuel-y cake batter, and I find it
delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 71.82% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD, just the way I like a
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Binsk
for the delicious cake face live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I'm going to
talk about a power outage I experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a little bit about
curing our medicine.

[SPEAKER_00]: character I'm not a comic book hero I
don't need to have my own logo on my chest
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time but sometimes it's acceptable
I guess anyway I'm rambling and chattery
[SPEAKER_00]: today shout out to our friends at Binsk
for the fucking concentrates that got me
[SPEAKER_00]: high as shit and made me rambly I enjoy it
let's try to get me back on track where
[SPEAKER_00]: are we headed with this podcast it is my
job to keep this thing on the rails here
[SPEAKER_00]: we go this is what we're gonna talk about
now recently the power went out where I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow I wasn't here or I wasn't there and I
showed up at the grow the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood was dark I was like huh
something's going on pulled up it was dark
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the normal sounds you hear in the
grow were happening I went to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is the clone machine was not bubbling
that was my number one concern I've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: easy cloner going usually I hear that
constant it just never stops there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always the sound of that just a worrying
watering thing happening it's always going
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not hear that so I went into a light
panic mode I wouldn't say a major panic
[SPEAKER_00]: mode I did go into a light panic and I
said shit the cloners not working I wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: how long that's been going I noticed all
the lights were out the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: was out the fans were not blowing
everything was shut down the cloner was my
[SPEAKER_00]: major concern like I've said but this made
me think maybe I should tell our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: what we could do in the situation of a
power outage the number one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of is to remind you to buy digital
timers when you're buying timers for your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow you got the opportunity to buy
digital timers with a battery backup or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy those shitty timers with the
little pegs that you push down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you plug them in and they turn and as time
goes by those pegs are either up or down
[SPEAKER_00]: and those pegs tell it to be off or on
those are fine but when the power goes out
[SPEAKER_00]: those timers stop spinning so those little
pegs nothing happens while the time is out
[SPEAKER_00]: while the power is out nothing happens
that timer quits turning so when the power
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back on it resumes where it is so if
you're in the middle of your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle the timer goes off your six hours
into flower and your flowering day power
[SPEAKER_00]: goes off power comes on anytime later
we're gonna say three hours later now your
[SPEAKER_00]: timer is gonna kick back on and it's going
to continue this six hour day cycle that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got programmed because time stood
still on your timer while time kept moving
[SPEAKER_00]: in the real world on the Babylon clock
time kept moving on the Sun clock time
[SPEAKER_00]: kept moving on your little broken timer
with the power outage time stayed still so
[SPEAKER_00]: when the time comes back on all of your
cycles all of your routines all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythms are now fucked nothing is the way
you expected it to be you've got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and manually readjust the time on
that timer or it's going to be off until
[SPEAKER_00]: you fix it and sometimes the power goes
off and you're not at the place where the
[SPEAKER_00]: power goes off maybe I didn't show up at
that grow in time and the power came back
[SPEAKER_00]: on and it had been off for four hours I
never would have known that timer would
[SPEAKER_00]: have adjusted itself four hours so my grow
would have been off everything would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been mistimed by four hours and that could
that could destroy everything so by the
[SPEAKER_00]: digital timer with a battery backup that
way when the power goes out if the power
[SPEAKER_00]: were to go out here and I had that timer
plugged in behind me it would keep ticking
[SPEAKER_00]: it would follow the normal Babylon clock
it would follow the rest it would follow
[SPEAKER_00]: my cell phone because my phone doesn't die
when the power goes out that clock keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: going so would my battery backup clock
that way when the power does come back on
[SPEAKER_00]: it can it'll stay on the same schedule
when the power goes off it does not
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to run my light with the backup
battery don't think that's what the backup
[SPEAKER_00]: battery is for that backup battery is to
keep the time at the same time then when
[SPEAKER_00]: the power comes back on it is still
whatever time it is on your phone on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Babylon clock it's that time still on your
timer all of your cycles are set where
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be you shouldn't miss a beat
other than that time that it was off so I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope I made that point clearly because
that was a lot of fucking rambling once
[SPEAKER_00]: again shout out to the dabs buy digital
timers if you have got the opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: digital digital timers are much better
than the analog timers that stick and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't keep flowing when the time cuts out
when the power cuts out time stops on
[SPEAKER_00]: those so get yourself a digital timer and
stay correct on your time now where do we
[SPEAKER_00]: go from there I keep mentioning that easy
cloner that was the thing that made me
[SPEAKER_00]: panic the most I ran and I checked the
easy cloner I lifted it up and I touched
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots of the plants they were barely
starting to root they were wet they were
[SPEAKER_00]: moist they were not dripping with water
like I would like them to be but they had
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture to them which means they were
going to survive so that power couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have been out for very long so what I do
with my power cloner with my easy cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: turbo cloner power cloner all of those
electric cloners that spray water from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom if your power does go out my advice
to you is about every 30 minutes to an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour lift that lid up and just use a spray
bottle and spray those roots spray those
[SPEAKER_00]: where they would normally get misted spray
them just manually go in there with a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray bottle and spray the shit out of
them if you need to scoop up some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water that is in the cloner and use that
water as your spray just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them that way the roots stay nice
and wet or the root zone where the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to happen stay nice and wet you
don't kill off your clones spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: every 30 45 minutes just keep them wet
maybe once every hour and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: survive so that is a way to keep the easy
cloner the turbo cloners alive now if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are missing light hours that's okay the
power went off while I was gone that is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay you cannot have power the lights come
on during the dark cycle that is a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: having the lights go off during the dark
during the day cycle if the lights go off
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day cycle all you're really
losing is that photosynthetic energy
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting the photons the energy
the light energy from the from the light
[SPEAKER_00]: that day so your plants are going to lack
that little bit but it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental as if you were getting
interruptions in the dark period so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can miss a few hours one thing I did
notice quickly very quickly the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity of my grow spaces
went out of control it was really humid in
[SPEAKER_00]: there it was really stagnant it was quite
funky the temperature was moving around I
[SPEAKER_00]: could feel the humidity in there however I
couldn't tell you what the temperature or
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity are because the devices I use are
attached to a plug-in device and when the
[SPEAKER_00]: power went out they were no longer powered
I didn't know what was happening in that
[SPEAKER_00]: room for that period of time when the
power came back on all my monitors came
[SPEAKER_00]: back on but my monitoring devices are
powered by electricity and when the power
[SPEAKER_00]: went out so did my device so I don't know
what happened in that room during that
[SPEAKER_00]: power outage it could have been a hundred
and whatever degrees it could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: four degrees I don't know it could have
been fifty percent humidity it could have
[SPEAKER_00]: been ninety percent I don't know I could
only tell you that I could feel it it was
[SPEAKER_00]: damp in there and it was funky so
everything went out of control the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity the temperature it was all wacky
for quite a while all you can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hope for the best in that
situation I don't know what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: because I didn't have a monitor what I can
say is hope for it to get back on schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as possible when that power comes
on go and check all of your timers go
[SPEAKER_00]: check all of your settings and make sure
everything is set exactly how you thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was check your light timer check all of
your pumps if you're running hydro check
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those pumps check all of your fans
check your air conditioner anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs in that can fuck up check it when
the power goes out because it probably did
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up where are we gonna go from here
I've got a lot of notes I feel like I
[SPEAKER_00]: skipped something oh if the power keeps
going off and on it was happening here I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they were working on it down the
street so if the power goes off and on if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like on for a few minutes and then it
shuts off and then it comes on it shuts
[SPEAKER_00]: off and you know it's gonna keep doing
that just unplug everything if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: flip the breaker flip the fucking breaker
to stop the power to that room because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is very stressful on your grow lights
maybe some of the modern LEDs will handle
[SPEAKER_00]: it but your HPS and your halide and your
sodium lights they're not gonna handle off
[SPEAKER_00]: and on cycles that rapidly very well
excuse me gotta clear my throat here
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not gonna handle the off and on
very well it would be better for your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment just to unplug it let it be off
for a couple of hours once you're sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got their shit fixed then plug it
back in and get it running that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: better for your equipment and probably
better for the plants you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: jumping humidity spikes you don't want
humidity dips you don't want hot and cold
[SPEAKER_00]: all day and the plants are not gonna know
what to do with that that's gonna cause
[SPEAKER_00]: you powdery mildew issues that's gonna
cause problems slower growth it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck things up in the grow also that's
gonna mess up your bulbs those bulbs only
[SPEAKER_00]: get so many strike times for them to come
on if you have to strike it six times
[SPEAKER_00]: today plus hot starts are not good that'll
slow down your ballast performance and
[SPEAKER_00]: your bulb so it may be best just to unplug
it and make sure it doesn't keep going off
[SPEAKER_00]: and on I'm making sure I've got all my
notes covered here um so make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: reset everything when it comes back on
like I said before everything that can
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up when the power goes off will fuck
up when the power goes off you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: get everything back in sync don't just
assume that that fan is gonna come back on
[SPEAKER_00]: when you think it should that air
conditioner will come on that those
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblers will cycle as you think so go
ahead and check them part of being a good
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and being an okay grower is that
eye for detail did you bother to go check
[SPEAKER_00]: on all the settings did you bother to go
make sure that things were correct or do
[SPEAKER_00]: you just assume hope and pray because
assuming hoping and praying might not get
[SPEAKER_00]: you there if you physically got your
stoned ass up off the couch and went
[SPEAKER_00]: looked you know it's good you've only got
yourself to blame put some pride into your
[SPEAKER_00]: work set yourself up for success go check
on that shit dude it's that easy I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: love with my plants I'm in love with my
garden so if I hear something make the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong noise I'm in there looking like what
made that noise what happened I can hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from the garage from the driveway I can
hear the cycles of the house and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what should be happening and if I hear the
wrong noise before I'm even to the door I
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's a problem that's how much I
know my grow the other thing I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention on this part is daylight savings
time we just adjusted a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago to daylight savings time my question
for you is did you adjust your grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: or did you adjust your life to it because
those plants didn't care that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight savings time they've been on 1212
for so long did you fucking change that or
[SPEAKER_00]: did you just let it ride send me an email
grow from your heart at hotmail.com let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you did for daylight savings
time and what can you what are you gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do when it comes back because a lot of us
have our lights scheduled right before you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave for work you got an hour when the
lights come on so you can water them or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they come on right when you get home
from work how are you adjusting to
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight savings time did you adjust your
life or did you just go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up change the fucking timer in
the middle of a flowering cycle let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you did grow from your heart at
hotmail.com all right podcast world this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the part of the show where I read a
message from patreon once again I do
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you to support the show on
patreon at patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart today's patreon message
goes a lot like this it says what's up
[SPEAKER_00]: rasta jeff and what's up mike you hear it
mike you're getting a shout out I invite
[SPEAKER_00]: you to be back on the show it goes like
this it says I just did a fat dab and I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave my mom a hug and now I've got a quick
question that is perfect the question goes
[SPEAKER_00]: like this have you ever heard of the paper
bag method we have recently started using
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper bag method and it seems to be
working out pretty well the only thing I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running into is that I'm still having a
little bit of a green taste to it seven
[SPEAKER_00]: days after being in the bag so I need to
let it cure for another seven to fourteen
[SPEAKER_00]: days or let it dry in the bag for another
three to seven days I hope to hear from
[SPEAKER_00]: you soon this may be only the only month I
can give ten bucks because I need to save
[SPEAKER_00]: up for some of your genetics from your
friend Jake hey Jake don't stress bro if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't support the show on patreon I do
understand it is voluntary it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: mandatory I do appreciate the support
you're giving us now and it is time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you some seeds bro I'd rather see you
growing seeds in your garden that's
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting me on patreon because the seed
will give back I'm gonna give to you for
[SPEAKER_00]: free grow some seeds and then when you can
come find me on patreon again no hard
[SPEAKER_00]: feelings thank you for the great message
thank you for the patreon support now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about this paper bag method
I've heard of the paper bag method what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper bag method that is drying and
curing basically curing our cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_00]: brown paper bag a lot of people will cut
the plants down they'll let them hang
[SPEAKER_00]: until they're dry until the stem snap a
little bit they do it perfectly right up
[SPEAKER_00]: until then then when it comes to the
curing process they put them in a brown
[SPEAKER_00]: paper bag that brown paper bag is then
rolled up and sealed up at the end some
[SPEAKER_00]: people put it in the refrigerator some
people leave it in a cool dry dark area
[SPEAKER_00]: some people do it different ways however I
don't approve or like the brown paper bag
[SPEAKER_00]: method because it leaves a brown paper bag
flavor to your buds that is why I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: always recommend drying and curing in
either glass if you can or in plastic in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large commercial environment I will cure
any plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: container a very big plastic container
we'll talk about that in a moment needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: escape from the environment it's not
escaping it is getting stuck in your brown
[SPEAKER_00]: paper bag it is staying right there and
that flavor is just sticking to your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wrap those buds in something that a
sushi roll those buds are gonna taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: a sushi roll if you wrap them in a wet
towel they'll taste like a wet towel if
[SPEAKER_00]: you wrap your dried buds in a blunt wrap
they taste like shit sorry that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion I just wanted to throw that out
there if you wrap your wet buds in a brown
[SPEAKER_00]: paper bag they're going to taste like a
brown paper bag and chlorophyll so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I believe you are getting this
non-desirable flavor and aroma I never
[SPEAKER_00]: ever recommend drying in cardboard or
paper bags or anything like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: paper material will hold the moisture that
moisture will hold the chlorophyll that
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll will put that flavor right
back into your buds so I prefer I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend drying in glass or large plastic
containers the way you want to do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is just a quick method of how I would
recommend doing it cut the plants down get
[SPEAKER_00]: the big leaves off of them let them hang
until the stem snap you want those stems
[SPEAKER_00]: popping not exploding but cracking at that
point trim them you want I prefer a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: trim I think it's much easier it's much
quicker it's not as messy I just think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much more efficient so hang them take
off the big leaves let them dry cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: into smaller pieces and trim it up at that
point put it into a glass jar fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass jar about 90% of the way full you
want some room for air in there put those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in the jar I am very OCD also I'm
very committed to my grow I'm able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: these things I set a timer for 30 minutes
when I first put them in the jar seal up
[SPEAKER_00]: that jar 30 minutes 30 minutes later I
come back I dump them out of the jar let
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds sit for a minute make sure
they're not too sticky too tacky too wet
[SPEAKER_00]: if I agree if I believe that they are the
appropriate moisture level to put back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar they go back in the jar I seal it
up now I set my alarm for about an hour I
[SPEAKER_00]: come back I check in an hour pour the buds
out of the jar feel them are they ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back in the jar maybe I jarred too
early this is my opportunity to say I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna fuck this up I'm not gonna put them
back in the jar yet so I let them sit out
[SPEAKER_00]: until I feel like they're right this is
kind of an art form you have to learn this
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to be so wet that the buds
if you squeeze them you don't want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay flattened you want it spongy to where
it pops back up but you also don't want it
[SPEAKER_00]: so dry that when you squeeze it it turns
to dust you want to put it in there to
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's enough moisture in the jar
to trigger the reaction to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobes eat the chlorophyll but you
don't want it so moist in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to create a moldy environment
so now is your opportunity to check it out
[SPEAKER_00]: check it the first hour if it's
appropriate put it back in the jar if not
[SPEAKER_00]: let it sit if it sits out for a while
catch up with us to this step put it back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jar we've all got our buds dried
appropriately put them back in the jar set
[SPEAKER_00]: a timer I'm gonna set a timer for another
hour depending on how the sticky those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds were one to two hours I'm gonna come
back and check on them at this point we
[SPEAKER_00]: are starting the curing process they're
not too moist I'm sure they're not too
[SPEAKER_00]: moist they can go in the jar for an
extended time I'm gonna check on them
[SPEAKER_00]: every four hours for the next two days
possibly pop open that jar let it sit for
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 maybe 20 minutes depending on the level
of moisture and the aromas that come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that jar if it still feels sticky and
moist when you touch the buds give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more time if they're starting to
dry out don't give it so much time then
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly increase your time that it's left
in that jar you can go from 4 hours to 6
[SPEAKER_00]: hours to 8 to 12 eventually 24 36 48 hours
before you burp that jar don't leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: closed too long too early is the major
thing to look at if you can do multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: jars if you can set up like four or five
jars from your harvest and only open this
[SPEAKER_00]: one every so often and this one longer and
this one longer maybe maybe see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens if you do longer and shorter
periods you've got to experiment a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit with curing I wish I could give you
perfect parameters but your environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going to play the most into your
drying and curing differences it's I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado it's cold and dry here I can dry
and cure your herb super quickly if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were in Florida it's gonna be super moist
it's gonna take a lot longer for your herb
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry so your environment and how wet the
buds were when they went into the curing
[SPEAKER_00]: container are going to determine how often
and how soon you need to open those jars
[SPEAKER_00]: so don't let my advice fuck you up if
you're in a if you got wetter buds do it
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner and more often if they're drier do
it less and longer intervals that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: advice so I said I would do it in large
plastic containers if I had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: product I am known for running commercial
cultivation facilities I'm a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation consultant you can hire me I
will go to your commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility I'll spend a day there looking at
your grow seeing what kind of strategy you
[SPEAKER_00]: have seeing what kind of standard
operating procedures you are using I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the staff a little bit I'll see who
is on top of their game and the staff I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see where your weakest link is and I can
make recommendations on how to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall performance of your facility in a
short amount of time that is my job part
[SPEAKER_00]: of my job is improving people's drying and
curing method I see a lot of wacky shit so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the way I do it in a
commercial environment we do it the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way we start the same way as the glass jar
method and a small cultivation cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant take off the big leaves cut the
plants down hang them upside down until
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems pop when those stems start to
pop I will cut the bigger buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: branches off of the plants and leave that
main stock so you got the big stock with
[SPEAKER_00]: the main Christmas tree coming out the
menorah cut all the buds off of that now
[SPEAKER_00]: you just got the menorah that part goes in
another area that's got to get weighed and
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for before we can throw it away
that's another story I will take those big
[SPEAKER_00]: buds they're probably the length of my arm
somewhere between 16 and 30 inches long
[SPEAKER_00]: yes we do grow buds that big in a
commercial cultivation facility we fill
[SPEAKER_00]: the room with those buds we chop them
until they will fit into a large stir
[SPEAKER_00]: light or Rubbermaid container it's about
30 inches long maybe 36 32 inches long
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about a foot and a half tall and it's
got a lid that goes on top of it you all
[SPEAKER_00]: know about the storage containers I'm
talking about if you've moved they're used
[SPEAKER_00]: used for moving if you ship groceries I
see a lot of groceries shipped in these
[SPEAKER_00]: things it's a stir light storage container
you can get them at Target you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: them just about anywhere you buy plastic
stuff those are great for drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing your product if you have a large
amount of product I know they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: airtight we're gonna get to that in a
moment but I take my plants and I will put
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants inside of those containers I'll
mark the date that they went into that
[SPEAKER_00]: container and then I will put them in a
dry and cure room now let's talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure room this is why the
containers don't need to be airtight I
[SPEAKER_00]: have got a humidifier on a controller that
every time it gets below or above 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity that dehumidifier comes on I
don't know if I said humidifier or
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier in the first round but my
point is I have got both devices I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier and a dehumidifier in the room
both set to 50% now they are fighting all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long it's going to stay 50% stays
about somewhere between 45 and 55 maybe 60
[SPEAKER_00]: to 50% relative humidity in that room
constantly with those two devices going
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Colorado it gets hot it gets cold it
gets dry it gets wet so the devices do
[SPEAKER_00]: have to adjust to the normal they have to
fight the normal atmosphere but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part it is 50% relative humidity in
my drying and curing room so I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: those stir light bins filled with buds
they're mostly airtight they seal up
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well but then to compensate for the
lack of seal in there I make the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: room ideal for those plants to be dried
and cured in I also dried those plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room with the 50% relative humidity
and the perfect temperature in there
[SPEAKER_00]: usually about 75 degrees depends on like I
said outside factors other environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors make a huge difference but that's
the way we do it in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment then I've got a person it used
to be Mike it used to be Ernie there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple other guys that I've taught very
well how to dry and cure buds in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environment you got to take all
those big bins line them up on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: pop the lids off of every single one of
them go and put your hand in there and see
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture level of those buds I like to
turn them over I don't let them sit with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom buds on the bottom the entire
time flip them those bottom buds need some
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air too so they could dry properly
flip them over so I will open them all up
[SPEAKER_00]: we will leave them open for a determined
amount of time like I said before if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're brand new they'll stay open for
maybe an hour on a commercial grill in
[SPEAKER_00]: that 50% room then we'll seal them back up
maybe it'll just be 15 minutes maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: pop them open and go ooh these are ready
when we go ooh these are ready that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: they get trimmed they don't even get
trimmed all the way until they're done
[SPEAKER_00]: being dried and cured we can keep them in
stasis in that room and they get perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: for the trim crew and when we need them we
just go get them we can catch up that way
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a struggle to be trimming
everything all at once we take down 50 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 lights worth of plants all at once you
don't want to have to scramble to trim
[SPEAKER_00]: that all today you can get it bucked down
you can get it in those containers get it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dry and cure bins get it in a
stasis situation and then when you need it
[SPEAKER_00]: go ahead and trim it get it bagged up send
it out to the stores that's the way we do
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a big room I use the big plastic
bins in a room that is dialed in all right
[SPEAKER_00]: so I hope I did not ruin your hopes and
dreams by saying that your cure method
[SPEAKER_00]: does need improvement I think as long as
you're drying and curing in paper bags
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a chlorophyll and
brown paper bag taste glass jars are not
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive ironically there are not any
glass jars available anywhere right now we
[SPEAKER_00]: are in a pandemic situation and I think
everybody decided to can their product or
[SPEAKER_00]: they all harvested early because glass
jars are hard to find right now good luck
[SPEAKER_00]: with that but that's what I recommend
glass jars if you cannot find glass I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend plastic is my second
recommendation go for the medical grade
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic if you can the quality food grade
plastics if not do what you've got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: but get away from that brown paper bag I
don't think you're ever going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied you're like crippling yourself
you're running you're running you're about
[SPEAKER_00]: to run the race win the race and then
right at the end of the race you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking I'm gonna sit down and just eat a
sandwich you could have won but instead
[SPEAKER_00]: you put your shit in a brown paper bag
don't do that anymore let's upgrade your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden let's upgrade your game let's start
drying and curing in glass if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic is your next bet I've also seen
people do it in stainless steel containers
[SPEAKER_00]: that would work for me sounds expensive to
buy a bunch of stainless steel containers
[SPEAKER_00]: however if that works you do that all
