[SPEAKER_00]: And action, here we go, you bad
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 486 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Dayrecker
BX Full Spectrum Extract from our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of peach wrecker and
dayrecker on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as gas,
fuel, and chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will absolutely agree with that,
but there is also a touch of sweetness,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I believe probably comes from the
peach wrecker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me real talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me kind of buzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
this product contains 52% 0.31% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy the flavor and the buzz
from the Dayrecker BX Full Spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of diamonds to the amount of
sauce was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to have a nice perfect
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: Dayrecker BX Full Spectrum Extract
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
in this episode, I'm going to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of listener emails before we get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some shout outs to our friends
from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: our new friend, OkieGrow720.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big thank you shout out to our
friend, Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanner M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to our buddy, Bjorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to send a big thank you
shout out to our buddy, Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we need to send a big thank you
shout out to Captain Mojo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I'd like to send a big Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast high five shout out and a
thank you to our friend, Paul Hogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's been far too long since
I've given you a garden update,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's talk briefly about what is
happening in the IRE genetics garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently working with the reversed
blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am replenishing the TMNT line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am remaking the Michelangelo,
the Raphael, the Donatello, the Leonardo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, the Bebop and Rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their mother plants were pollinated today
by the reversed blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 50 to 60 days from now, those seeds
will be finished growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I need harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, I need packaging time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds will be available at all
of the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I'm ready to reveal the
secret on what those new crosses may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when the time comes, I will announce
it here on the podcast first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, if you hear the tickle in
my nose, sometimes it sounds like I might
[SPEAKER_00]: sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because I was in the room filled
with pollen and I'm going to have a runny
[SPEAKER_00]: nose for the next 24 hours, but it was
worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what is happening in the IRE
genetics breeding garden right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep you updated as to how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know how the seeds look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know when it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can stay on top of it and
know when they will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of the show, I did say we were
going to read some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into the email portion
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a long time
listener of the podcast and I absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly learn a lot from you as I have a
strong passion for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you share a passion for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say two weeks ago,
I received, I'm not going to say the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seeds or the name of the vendor
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave some details out just
to be classy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names will be changed to protect the
innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I received seeds, from a vendor
and all five of those seeds were very
[SPEAKER_00]: small and gray colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see where this is headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we pay money for seeds, we hope to
open the package and see big fat,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a strain won't make giant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains just make little seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains don't make tiger stripe
seeds, but we still hope to find quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy seeds in our packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a breeder, it is our responsibility
to select quality seeds that we put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find unhealthy looking seeds that is
just disheartening and makes you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: weird from the beginning of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I germinated three of the seeds
using the cup of water into a paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he soaked them in a cup of water for 12
hours, then folded them up into a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says he let them soak in the paper
towel for 24 hours and the tap roots
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted an eighth of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I potted them into solo cups filled with
two thirds cocoa, one third per light and
[SPEAKER_00]: wetted the medium prior to planting the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds sprouted three days later
underneath a 250 watt metal halide,
[SPEAKER_00]: four feet above the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I gradually lower the light to
approximately 20 inches above the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with my ballast on a dim setting to make
sure I do not give too much light to these
[SPEAKER_00]: small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the temperatures stayed
consistently around 77 degrees and the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity was around 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seeds stopped stretching, but the first
true leaves grew at an incredibly slow
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, it sounds like you correctly
germinated the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you potted them correctly
into a decent mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 250 watt light will work for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four feet above may have been a little bit
high, but it says you slowly lowered that
[SPEAKER_00]: light to 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your message, it sounds like you're
doing things correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 77 degrees and 60% humidity,
which is ideal for those little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say that you were getting
incredibly slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says it has now been 10 days since
the seeds popped through the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: began to see the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I watered them, I made sure all the
medium got wet and I allowed for adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff and discarded the remaining water
from the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seedlings are two inches tall and are
very small for 10 days out of the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reviews for this company were not good
when I finally did some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that these seeds are just very
low quality, but I would like to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps I'm doing something wrong and
maybe you can help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were very passionate about your
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I now ordered a batch of your feminized
orangegasm seeds from seeds here now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm hoping for great success using
these quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great place to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking you may just have low quality
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason why I did not say the
breeder or the vendor or the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for me to say anything bad
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already experienced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know not to mess with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to blast them out on the
podcast and start a problem with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, unfortunately,
it sounds like you have bought seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got seeds that were probably harder
harvested too early or those plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: not fed properly or there was a problem in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely the plants were taken too
early and those seeds were not ready from
[SPEAKER_00]: the description you give of their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to blame the grow problems
on low quality seeds, but we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: blame the overall problem on a lack of
research before purchasing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was where you made the mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all make mistakes, but you've learned
you have found out that that company is
[SPEAKER_00]: not worth spending your money with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have since then purchased some
high quality feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grew those less than high quality
seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will see what some high quality,
I read genetics seeds will do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully when those seeds grow,
they re instill your confidence and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that the problem was with those
other seeds and not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wrap up the message by saying thank
you so much for taking time to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to hearing your
thoughts on my situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are more than welcome to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign it with sincerely Johnny
skids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my new friend,
Johnny skids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is unfortunate that you bought seeds
from a company that is unreputable,
[SPEAKER_00]: a company that sold you shitty seeds,
a company that basically ripped you off
[SPEAKER_00]: and took your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad that that happened to you,
but it is a great learning lesson,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only for yourself, but for everybody
listening to this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm telling you that you can learn
from this listener, from our new friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny skids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make the same mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're going to buy seeds,
there are several, there are many reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: and reputable seed companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy I read genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my preference, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like food.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brand may not be the one that gets your
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's another brand, another strain,
another seed line out there that gets your
[SPEAKER_00]: eye, that gets your attention,
check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put that in your grow room,
I encourage you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do research before you purchase those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend a lot of money on a
package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to wait for them to get
shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always stressful, depending on
where they're coming from and where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a stressful situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for a grower like myself with a lot
of experience, a lot of patience,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of understanding, a lot of
resources, it is often stressful trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I found three or five seeds of
something rare, that I really want,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit of anxiety trying to
germinate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need those to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in the same position as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what it's like spending money
on seeds and hoping to get something out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending money on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to spend money on all of
the shit it needs to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to invest time and your
energy and hopefully some love into these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you do any of that, set yourself
up for success by doing research on first
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this really the strain I think it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the right strain for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it medicate the way that I am
expecting it to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it grow the way I'm expecting it to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then research the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that breeder a reputable person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they reliable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they known for having good customer
service?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also see if that strain came from that
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes another breeder will be
secondhand making a strain that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really belong to them, but they're just
kind of out-crossing or in-crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: something and kind of capitalizing on
another popular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you are getting the
strain you want from the closest original
[SPEAKER_00]: source that you can find it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a rise, get a rise from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get a rise from somebody else that
made it a rise out-cross and is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalize on my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds strange, but that is
what a lot of unreputable and unscrupulous
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to get as close to the source as
possible when you're looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that you've fallen in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out about that breeder's customer
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a good breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a good person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have a good reputation online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever met them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any other friends that have
met them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis world and the cannabis
industry is becoming larger, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming smaller at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just normal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know people just like you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know somebody that knows me
personally if you were in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or cannabis world at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all go to the same events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all at the same parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one big happy family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody out there knows the breeder
that you were trying to buy seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, you have to worry about gossip
and bullshit because that is also
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your research before you buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to research the vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you buying the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting them from SeedsHereNow
.com, which I can highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will vouch for them all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting them from
RandomFuckingSeedBank.net that you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know who represents that
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what country they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may just take your money and run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take your money and send you a
bunch of gray seeds that look like shit
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow out to be a bunch of mutants like
they did to our new friend Johnny Skids
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't fall for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for discounted prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you should really think about in
today's cannabis seed market is fake
[SPEAKER_00]: strain recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes one thing that really drives me
crazy is I see people saying that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have got Gorilla Glue number four seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why that cannot be a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue number four is a clone only
plant, which means there are no male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants of Gorilla Glue to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person who made Gorilla Glue never
released a male of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gorilla Glue was made on accident to
the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few seeds of the Gorilla Glue were
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The keepers, to the best of my knowledge,
were known as Gorilla Glue number four and
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue number seven, which tells me
there were probably somewhere between one
[SPEAKER_00]: and 10 seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got at least four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got at least seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably 10 seeds planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers four and seven were probably the
keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those became popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number seven was not circulated very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue number four was very sought
after and was circulated online and
[SPEAKER_00]: through trading and through events and
through the cannabis community very
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly and very widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my hands on a Gorilla Glue number
four cut very early in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main part is Gorilla Glue number
four was a specific phenotype of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the number four seed to be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the selected cultivar out of that
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gorilla Glue number four is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a male of Gorilla Glue number
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say they have seeds of
Gorilla Glue number four, they cannot have
[SPEAKER_00]: them unless they are feminized,
selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would make it a Gorilla Glue
number four S one feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would take a GG four, a clone,
you would reverse it and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate a GG four clone with that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make a GG four S one feminized
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see companies advertising Gorilla
Glue number four regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a Gorilla Glue number four
male to breed that with to make those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there were, that would be a Gorilla
Glue number four F two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You as a consumer have to be careful
because some of the breeding companies
[SPEAKER_00]: will try to trick you into buying a cross
that is not exactly what it is labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what will happen is you will grow
that cross and you put it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, whether it is the free market or
the medical market, and you label it
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people think that that's Gorilla
Glue number four when it really isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even worse, people say, hey,
motherfucker, this is not Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_00]: number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you selling me this bullshit?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what GG four should really smell
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's got a Gorilla Glue number
four regular seed, it is probably a back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross or it is straight up fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a back cross would mean that they took
Gorilla Glue number four and bred it to
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they may have gone back to the
Gorilla Glue number four with its
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most likely, if they're going to lie
to you about that already, they probably
[SPEAKER_00]: did not do that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took something that looks like GG
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pollinated the GG four and they sold
you seeds and said that is GG four when it
[SPEAKER_00]: is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is that as a consumer,
you have got to educate yourself because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are many unscrupulous, unreputable
companies out there with no morals who are
[SPEAKER_00]: only out there to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, they got our buddy,
Johnny Skids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this email got away
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super ranty on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should wrap it up by saying,
if you would like reliable seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly suggest iRegenetics and you can
find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
all you bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up this episode because
I feel like I just sound like I'm about to
[SPEAKER_00]: sneeze through the whole show.

[SPEAKER_00]: All I've got for you for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
buddy, Jesse James.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
Let's go.

[SPEAKER_02]: Faces that he sees, stomach that ain't
that familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't help when he's happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even so, after all my mortified lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He slowly chases that way.
Oh, something, yeah.
He'll begin his life again.
Life again.
Life again.
He's breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking through the paper though he
doesn't know to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, praying.
[SPEAKER_02]: After something that has never showed him
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understands whether or not the winner is
on his way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling far between all the legal halls of
shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even so, after all my mortified
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he don't know.
He looks insane.
Even
[SPEAKER_01]: so, after all my mortified lives.
Oh, he don't know.
He's breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He slowly
chases that way.
Oh, something, yeah.
He'll begin his life again.
Life again.
He's breathing.
Oh, he don't know.
He's breathing.
