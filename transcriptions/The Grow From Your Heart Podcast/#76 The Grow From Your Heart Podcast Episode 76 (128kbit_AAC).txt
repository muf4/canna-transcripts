[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the song you're listening to is
The Doggy Dub, and it's off their album,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out and support
the Mystic Roots band and stay positive
[SPEAKER_00]: sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know that while I'm recording
the podcast today, I am live on a new
[SPEAKER_00]: application called Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on Periscope are watching me live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got five live viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hear everything I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could not hear the theme song,
but they could hear everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to send comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can see on the bottom of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to pay attention to the
comments on Periscope while I record the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast today, but if this goes well in a
future episode, this may open up the doors
[SPEAKER_00]: for a questions and answer segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer them live on Periscope as I
record the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the future, it won't be any
more than I'll try to get it up as quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after the live Q&A, I'll go ahead
and throw the podcast up into iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher, and then you guys can listen to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you didn't already, if you
listen to it on the Periscope app,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you didn't already listen to it,
then you'll be able to hear the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: episode with questions from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to figure out how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys check out this Periscope app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can log in and you can watch people
broadcast their lives or you can broadcast
[SPEAKER_00]: your life if you'd feel like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going in the grow room and
walking around in the garden and showing
[SPEAKER_00]: people what I've got going on in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been driving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throwing the phone up on the dashboard
just while I drive around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this show, you guys, I do plan on
talking about pheno hunting and selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been teasing about pheno
hunting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get that far, though,
I do want to send a big happy birthday
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Maya Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, monkey bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is now 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out on the 14th,
late late at night on the 14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will hopefully listen to it on
the morning of the 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop it late on the 14th just
to say happy birthday to my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your daddy loves you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you're tired of hearing my
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one day when you're old and you
listen back to all the episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll catch this one and it'll put a
smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dads think about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy birthday, Maya bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you so much more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, a couple of nights ago, my good
buddy Clint got me a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's little brother, Chris,
and then we met up with our good buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, who will be on a future episode of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that, but we went up to
Denver to ComedyWorks and we saw Joey Coco
[SPEAKER_00]: Diaz and that motherfucker blew the roof
off of ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude ripped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best comedy shows I've
seen in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say that about every comedy show
when I come on this show, but it was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best shows I've seen in quite a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally kicked ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first six or seven minutes of the
show, he came out and he told a joke,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept telling jokes, but he told it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like he hit me and then I would
start laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I felt like I was going to
catch my breath, he'd hit me harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd laugh even harder and lose my
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I feel like I was coming
around, he'd hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was starting to get a pleasant pain
in my cheeks and stomach from laughing so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got this weird headache toward
the back of my head from laughing so
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Joey, stop for a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a little bit of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I cannot breathe and I cannot keep
up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving the periscope camera right now
so that they can see me a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got everything I need on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Joey Coco Diaz is definitely one of my
favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan says he's the best comedian on
the planet right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could almost agree with that if you're
into that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can listen to Joey talk all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to his podcast, The Church of
What's Happening Now, and it's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Joey Coco Diaz for
putting on an amazing fucking comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A comedy show at ComedyWorks in downtown
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Baker and the
entire ComedyWorks crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker, I owe you one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever need anything, if you're ever
in Pueblo, make sure you get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will hook you up with any help you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks, I love that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it once or seven times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best fucking comedy club in Colorado,
possibly the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send a huge shout out to
Clint for the ticket and for being a hell
[SPEAKER_00]: of a good friend, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my homie forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're a good friend, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're always going to be my
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to Joe and Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we killed it as a group at that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody whined about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe met us up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Clint and I all rode up
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was a little whiny girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a successful dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flirted with the beautiful waitress at
the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kicked ass at the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all met Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had a nice little smoke out in the
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the crew for kicking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are not painting the asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are grown men.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking love hanging out with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were all invited on the podcast
whenever you'd like to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote a note and I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to reach for a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down to give a shout out to a guy
who calls himself Beast of Omaha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Beast of Omaha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He follows me on Periscope when we were
talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told him that I do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he was going to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the episode I did right after we
spoke, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you were listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to get on to the main topic
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic of the show, you guys,
is going to be pheno hunting and selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take a lot of notes because I
feel like I can pull that episode off
[SPEAKER_00]: without a lot of preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got all the preparation in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I can pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one or two more things I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are my notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to announce something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to be really,
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very long time ago, I was scrolling
through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry about the clearing of the
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke dabs and drink caffeine and then
the throat goes to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, I was scrolling through
Instagram and I came across an Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: page of a lovely lady called Dude It's
Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been following Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's tattooed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got dreadlocks and she's fucking
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an amazing woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following Damsel on Instagram
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a good friend of mine,
our friend Hunt, the Grimy Gatsby,
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced me to Damsel and also my friend
Julia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give shouts to Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Jules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is partly responsible for introducing
me to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got introduced to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spoken a few times and I am proud to
announce that I am working on a strain for
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude It's Damsel, the suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a strain specifically selected
for her and this strain will represent
[SPEAKER_00]: Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stand out from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be something you want to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will smell beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her idea is that when she smokes it,
she wants a nice giggly sativa head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several, the seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have several crosses that I think
would make Damsel happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of just running one cross,
I'm going to run three or four crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see if one of those
gives us a phenotype that Damsel
[SPEAKER_00]: completely loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great segue to get into the
main meat of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic of this podcast is pheno
hunting and selecting a mother plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to focus on pheno
hunting because I've already gone about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me head over to Google here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about the microphone bumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me head over to Google here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also before I get too far, I want to give
a huge shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow at Dude It's
Damsel on Instagram and let her know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you support her new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the hashtag, hashtag Damsels Dank,
D-A-M-S-E-L-S-D-A-N-K, Damsels Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag Damsels Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her know that you follow iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow her on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the progress of the strain that
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start posting pictures soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Damsel for giving me the
honor to grow a strain that will represent
[SPEAKER_00]: her forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I want to send a big,
huge shout out to my buddy Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Hunt, thanks for linking Damsel and I
up together to get this project started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure this is going to work out great
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this project is completed and Damsel
has picked her favorite phenotypes or
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, the strain should be available
for purchase in flower form at Green and
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs and
also the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be a long time coming,
but once it's available, we will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get that far, I am going to have to
do a pheno hunt, which is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: main topic of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it feels like a good place to start
would be to define the word phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm headed over to Google and Wikipedia
says a phenotype is the set of observable
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of an individual resulting
from the interaction of its genotype with
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of what that says is if we have a
bunch of seeds and we grow them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are all the same genotype,
which means they came from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, the same batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we grow those out, we will see what is
called phenotypical expressions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means some of those plants are going
to show characteristics of its mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to show characteristics of
its father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to show characteristics of
grandparents that we didn't even see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the parent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them are going to show
perfect traits of 50-50 combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to see variations in
between depending on which phenyl
[SPEAKER_00]: generation you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to kind of put that is if you
have a brother or sister, you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: don't look exactly alike because you're
from the same parents, but you are
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your brother is a little taller than
you or a little fatter than you or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just phenotypical expression of the
same genotype basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're working with plants,
when we're looking for phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purpose of a pheno hunt is to find the
plant that you want from that 10 pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a couple of decisions to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the plant that represents the
one that's on the picture of the package
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds, the one that you read about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that grows a little
bit shorter for your grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that's a little more
indica dominant, the one that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more sativa dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about when you
are starting a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the pheno hunt is to run
through... See, I would recommend at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I do anywhere from 25 to 100
seeds of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ideal thing is to run as many of
these seedlings as you can underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: same conditions to find the one that you
want that is the stellar keeper out of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I see people purchase a
package of seeds and they will run two of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds and then they'll say,
hey, look, I've got sour diesel or hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I've got super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might have a decent super lemon
haze, but you don't have that super
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype because you haven't gone through
and done the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't pheno hunted out the one that
is stellar, that is worth keeping,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to blow everybody else's
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pheno hunt is where you're going to
find a lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have gotten that stellar
keeper out of just a couple, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do a large pheno hunt, the chances
of finding what you want and that stellar
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper, it's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a couple of really
popular phenotypes while we're on this
[SPEAKER_00]: subject before we get into me explaining
how I do my pheno, typical pheno hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about
jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a really popular phenotype of
jilly bean known as the candy store
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also another phenotype known
as the orange phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The candy store phenotype smells like when
you walk into the candy store in the mall,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got that sweet, it's like those candy
hearts you buy at Valentine's day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all smells real sugary and sweet and it
makes you want to eat candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the candy store phenotype
smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's of course why it's called candy
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange phenotype smells like a basket
of fucking oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are known phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you hear people talking about,
yeah, I got the orange phenotype or I got
[SPEAKER_00]: the jilly pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breathe a strain called heart of gold
and there is the chunky girl phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just grows big fat phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the mean girl,
which looks a little, she's real jagged
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way that her buds grow are real
spiky and pointy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call her the mean girl just because
she looks angry when she grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great plant, but it looks
like ferocious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an intimidating plant for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the other pheno,
which is the non-desirable pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that's more golden goat
leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep that pheno when I grow heart
of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll toss that one out right away when I
identify it, but that's more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you hear us talking about like
I've gotten the whatever pheno,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we're saying that we grew out
a pack of seeds and we found the pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: that was known, that's been talked about a
lot or that the breeder told you to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know that there are phenos of Black
Cherry Kim that I tell guys, my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, if you see that,
I wouldn't even keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just get rid of that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, if you see this,
that's kind of the one you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing Black Cherry Kim,
the one that shows dark, dark purple right
[SPEAKER_00]: away, like a plum purple right away,
I don't think that's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows little tiny popcorn balls of
bright, dark, dark purple buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't find that to be a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a pheno hunter, I know to throw that
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only know that because I've grown it
out so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm drifting a little bit away
from the topic, but it's all useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I should probably get into
explaining a little bit how I do a pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt or how I would recommend you doing a
pheno hunt as a kind of a new grower
[SPEAKER_00]: without a lot of space and a lot of money
to spend on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to do it, I would get a 10 pack
of seeds or a 12 pack if you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are selling 12s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get about 10 seeds if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to run a pheno hunt
for yourself, 10 is enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get seeds from a reputable company
from a reputable vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend stuff like Gage Green
Genetics, La Plata Labs, I read genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sin City Seeds has shown me some great
shit lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sour Seed Company has a great lineup
and a lot of great things to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great DNA genetics is
somebody who I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Dankness is somebody who I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of seed breeders out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys try to do some research,
get a reputable brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some good seeds and give yourself a
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a good 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized or regulars, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do, we're going to
germinate all 10 seeds and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do everything exactly the
same to all 10 of these seeds for almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all of their lives until kind of mid
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see that they need more water or
more nitrogen or more something in late
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, we'll make a note of that and then
we will keep that in mind when we select
[SPEAKER_00]: our keepers in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to germinate 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pay attention to them from
day one because you just want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a seed that's a straggler,
make a note of one that's a straggler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can label your seeds somehow,
like seed one, seed two, seed three,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So germinate these seeds, get them into
cups, grow them, take some pictures if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, about once a week if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we want to do is pay attention
to them really closely, veg them out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to take a clone of them as
soon as they're big enough to take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got these little plants that
are probably in like one to three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and you've probably taken a couple of
clones off of them hopefully, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to flower out the original
seed that you started or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that seedling as a mother plant or do
you want to keep one of the clones as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother and flower out that plant that's
already large?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a toss up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much space you have and
what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have learned is I like that seeded,
the seedling mother to stay as my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason it has more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a good idea to keep that
one as your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that that one's
already grown and already big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not flower it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately from watching clones grow and
watching seed plants grow, I prefer to
[SPEAKER_00]: have my mother plant come from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be hypocritical because sometimes
time doesn't always allow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I need the space in the room to
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bloom out the large plant that's
already going, but from now on I will try
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep that seed plant as my original
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big enough to take a clone off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a couple clones and then you
decide which one you want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to flower that original
mom, you put all 10 of those original seed
[SPEAKER_00]: moms into a flowering room and you treat
them all the exact same and you flower all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to do clones, all you have
to do is get the clones into pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them rooted and everything,
get them healthy, and then put those into
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll catch everything right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the same lesson now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is when you really have to start
paying attention and taking good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got males, you'll find out about
day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those out of there unless you plan on
breeding because those males are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start causing you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the males out of there about day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're phenohunting for males,
that'll be a whole nother episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even ready to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write it down, but I'm not sure that
that's going to happen for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenohunting males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really advanced lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be way up there in like the way
past episode 100, but we'll talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull out the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to take a lot of notes
because around week three, week four is
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're going to start seeing a lot of
different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something herms, you're probably going
to see that around between five and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep the hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a 10 pack, you're
probably going to get somewhere between
[SPEAKER_00]: four and six boys out of there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pull those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got like five more to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got fem seeds and probably you
lost one during germ, you only got nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you probably got four or five
plants to work with, maybe six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with fems, you may still
have 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them are going to be run team.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them be squatty or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to pull those squatty plants if
they're shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's healthy and not looking like a
runt and a problem, keep it because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you run LA confidential, the shitty
looking plant is the one you want to keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not crappy looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the small, slow growing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant looks like a runt,
you can go ahead and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to watch them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that fall over a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one attracts bugs or one attracts mold,
that's not the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for nanners, like I said,
around week five or eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a hermaphrodite, get rid of
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a lot of pictures, smell them,
pay a lot of attention to how they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have to harvest all
10 of these plants or however many made it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said four to six, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvest all four to six of these,
trim them down, cure them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to episode number 35 about drying
and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry and cure your medicine properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all of your finished plants are dried
and cured, it's time to do a few smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: samples on every phenotype that you've
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing it for just you,
you can smoke it and you can decide which
[SPEAKER_00]: one you like for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to be selling it or
giving it to medical patients or sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: it with your friends, it's a good idea to
pass out a few buds of each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't tell anybody which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just label it A or B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, tell me which one you like
better and tell me why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I send it off to a couple of my
patients, my buddy Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Doug?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I grow new plants, I don't
label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give them initials or a code word or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take it to Doug and I'll be like,
smoke these, tell me which ones we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep and which ones we should get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm his medical provider,
his opinion is a big influence on what I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also White Mike that's on the
podcast, Milky Trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: NemoPunk15, he does a lot of helping with
my selection also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the grower, it's a lot up to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of it is up to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows like shit, if it grows 12 feet
tall in eight weeks and you're indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're under an eight foot ceiling,
that's not the phenotype for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows 32 feet wide in six weeks and
you're in a small room, that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows super completely lanky and
falls over and needs a thousand stakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to get one bud kind of Scrog
system, that might not be the one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for the one that grows the way
that you want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that comes out to be the one
that smokes well also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically this is what I found is a
grower growing a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up with one that is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up with one that is
covered in resin and has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll probably have one that
tastes really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have one that harvest really,
really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can find one that does all of
those, then you're golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can get two or three of those,
if you can get the good high and the good
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sacrifice that for weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cashcropper, maybe you want to
sacrifice the good flavor for the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just think about what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a strain that does it all
for you, find that, get clones of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good phenohunt, you have to take
clones because if you don't take clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you grow, you're going to end
up having the best weed on the planet one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and not have a clone of it and be so
pissed off at yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys, that's the basics of a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically keep in mind that not all seeds
are going to yield the exact same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get the plants that you saw
in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get the plants that were
advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your goal is actually to find the one
that you love and keep that one around and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've got that one keeper,
you know what you can do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do another phenohunt of 10 more
seeds and find another keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's better than the other one that
you've got, then toss out that other one
[SPEAKER_00]: or do it until your mother room is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep hunting for keeper plants and
more keeper plants until you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: most stellar fucking lineup of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about keeping a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've grown this phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have found the plant that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the one that has the flavor you
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the high you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows well for your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got, you either took a clone of
it or you've got that remaining seed plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to use as a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trick to keeping that plant as your
mother plant is to keep it under a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a 19-5 cycle for my mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 19 hours on, five hours off because I
feel like this gives my plants plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: light to keep them from trying to auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more tropical strains we'll try to
auto flower if you let them go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: less light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 19-5, five hours to give them a
little bit of sleep cycle and let my
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every living thing likes to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to give my mother plants a
little bit of sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you keep your mother plant on a
vegetative cycle, a vegetative light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it alive indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to feed it some sort of like
just a basic veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're feeding your veg plants,
you can feed your mother plants that just
[SPEAKER_00]: basic nitrogen, keep the roots happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep them for a long time,
you're going to have to repot your
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, my mother plants only last
me about eight months to a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut new mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut six or eight clones for my mother
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will run four or five of those,
but I'll keep one of them behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go into a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go into pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just put it into that mother
room and replace the old mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because they start to get ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to get kind of lazy and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a bunch of cuts from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take clones from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been sprayed for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been manipulated under these lights
for eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to get kind of lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it's a good idea to take a
fresh cut from my mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it under that 19-5 light
indefinitely, and then just keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you prune it, if you keep it
free of bugs, if you keep it healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that mother plant will stick around and
give you lots and lots of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep that strain alive forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that wraps up phenohunting,
selecting a keeper and using that keeper
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mother all within, we got that down
here in 25 minutes and 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I really appreciate you listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded this in two sessions on a new
app called Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on possibly doing a podcast
through Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will record as normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also record on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're participating on Periscope,
you will be able to ask me questions live
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show and I will answer them for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll only be able to type in the text
box, but I'll be able to read them,
[SPEAKER_00]: answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to help out the listeners
live on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a little bit more interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try it out once and see how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to announce when it's going to
happen so that people can participate and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can get people on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll try to do regularly
scheduled shows like that every four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five episodes will be a question episode,
a live Q&A is what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, I really appreciate you listening
to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody on Periscope watching now,
thanks for participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I've been ignoring the chat on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more focused on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I will participate with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periscope is a new app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I log in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn on the camera and you talk and it
turns you into basically your own reality
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
