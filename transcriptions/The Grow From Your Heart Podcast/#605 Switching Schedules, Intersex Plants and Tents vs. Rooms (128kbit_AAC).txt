[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I did include that link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is going to be a fun
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got quite a few emails selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let me do a quick
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode talking about light leaks
and light leaks during the night cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: causing problems for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of messages saying,
yeah, but what about the moon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow outdoors and the moon is really
bright and the moon does not mess with my
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon is part of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the moon disrupted our plants outside,
nature would be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain briefly why the moon
does not disrupt your outdoor flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it puts off a red
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that the sun actually puts
off the red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something with the atmosphere,
the angle of the sun and the sky create a
[SPEAKER_00]: red spectrum of light that happens in our
environment and is fed to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants receive that red spectrum that
is known as far-red lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That far-red lighting triggers something
in our plants known as phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phytochrome red response makes the
plants think, oh, it is sleepy time and I
[SPEAKER_00]: should go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are basically giving the plants a
little dose of Nyquil when they see that
[SPEAKER_00]: red light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more solidly put to sleep
than the plants that we have in our indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden unless you're supplementing with
far-red light pucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason your plants are not freaking
out outdoors is because of that far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum has put them to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a more deep sleep state than
our plants that are in the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment because they're not getting
sun and they're not getting that far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also your grow lights, your flashlight
does not compare at all to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to getting that sunshine all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most intense light they can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the proper light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting the best light,
the most intense all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they get that far-red spectrum,
triggers phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why they do not freak out from the
moonlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nothing compared to that bright
sunlight they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That combined with the far-red spectrum,
the phytochrome red response, they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out outdoors due to the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will, however, freak out outdoors due
to your porch light or a street light
[SPEAKER_00]: right above your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all plant-specific, but the moon
should not disrupt your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unnatural lights still do have
the opportunity to disrupt your plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the night cycle outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've cleared that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who sent me
that question because I got that question
[SPEAKER_00]: from at least 10 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, why don't my plants freak out
from the moon?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how nature works, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've cleared that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into the real part of
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of emails here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still selecting testers, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent an episode out a while back telling
you how to become a tester, asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: tester applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got probably 2,500 tester applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel dismissed or forgotten if you
have not gotten a reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going through testers and I'm still
selecting testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still being sent out,
so keep your hopes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, I don't just do testing
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always new things being created,
so I'm always going to need new testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll select about 10 testers for every
batch of seeds that I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I send them out, I do about 10 at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll select 10 testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I select about 10 more, get them
going, select about 10 more, get them
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are seven out of each batch of 10
are going to reply, which will give me
[SPEAKER_00]: three open spots for the next time I'm
looking for testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 70% reliability on the testers I
send stuff out to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testers will fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: New testers will be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like you missed an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like I ignored you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like I blew you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of responses and a lot of
submissions, and I'm trying to read
[SPEAKER_00]: through each and every one of them
carefully so I don't miss any valid,
[SPEAKER_00]: any great potential candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, again, you guys, don't feel
discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are still interested in being a
tester, go listen to my tester episode
[SPEAKER_00]: before you even apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that you listen to
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all of the instructions and
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know what I want from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can help each other meet a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep the tester applications coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time when we jump in to the
email Patreon message part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you want your questions read on
Patreon, all you have to do is support us
[SPEAKER_00]: on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to patreon.com forward slash grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign up for Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get your questions right on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Yee
Motherfucking Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, my wife mentioned to me that she
thinks she would like to try her hand at
[SPEAKER_00]: growing her own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when the wife tries to get
involved with growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why shouldn't she be right in there
helping you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is not a boys club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the lady should be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, how awesome is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A family that grows together, grows
together, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I currently run my lights
from 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: because I work from home and it's just
been convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with her work schedule and
spending time with our family,
[SPEAKER_00]: this time frame is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got it on your perfect schedule,
but it doesn't include the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very logical and rational needs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm thinking about switching from
9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can both go into the garden together
when the lights come on and the kids are
[SPEAKER_00]: in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will both be home at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids are in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can wrap up the night together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, electricity is cheaper at off peak
hours, so you will save a couple of bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: on the electric bill by doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I run a perpetual
flower space and I hate to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: drastic time change on my girls,
but I'm willing to do it if it means
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing my passion with my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great dedication, a great
sacrifice you're ready to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question part is, my question is,
how fast can I make the transition in
[SPEAKER_00]: timing from my lights on at 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to my lights on at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: without having detrimental effects on my
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: My thought is to change my timer by three
or four hours at a time, but leave a week
[SPEAKER_00]: or two between those changes to let plants
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a better time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be harmful overall or just fuck
it and swap the timer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all you do for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 surely would have been much,
much, much, much worse without the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast in my ears and I
read genetics in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I could make 2020 a little bit
better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we're off to making 2021
even better for you already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my solution for your.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem, but it is a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my answer for your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if you heard that come through
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not gradually, slowly change the
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to be more
confusing, more stressful to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the lights go off at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: when they go off at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: unplug them, leave them unplugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let that 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally the lights would go off at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they go off at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: today, unplug them, let them stay
unplugged all the way until the next 6 p
[SPEAKER_00]: .m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've done 24 hours of total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got their 12 hours of sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to freak out too much on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I would do is I would plug them
in, turn them back on at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to go 24 would be 6,
you know, 27 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go about 27 hours of total
darkness before you get them back on their
[SPEAKER_00]: normal schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is much less stressful to the
plants than manipulating the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to know what's going on
if you manipulate it a little bit every
[SPEAKER_00]: day and they're constantly going to try to
adjust and catch up with your changes and
[SPEAKER_00]: your manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will not make the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to bite the bullet, like I said,
unplug that timer, let it stay unplugged
[SPEAKER_00]: for the duration of the normal dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go for another extended dark period
and then plug it in at 9 o'clock when you
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I say to do it for the extended
dark and don't do the slow interval is
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are just going to get an
extended dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't freak out too much on a long
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll think they just got a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may just think that it was a cloudy
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get any photons for that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find more problems, more errors,
more potential for intersex traits when we
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the timer too drastically too
many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one big switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take a long nap and then
they're going to wake up and they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: back on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you wanted to if I change my
schedule from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and you wanted me to work nights tomorrow,
I'd probably just try to sleep a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and then wake up and be refreshed from my
brand new shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your plants are going to like it
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go off at let me make sure I read
the times right because I want to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They currently come on at 6 and go off at
6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: when they go off, unplug that timer,
let them run for 24 full hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're back at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to turn them on at 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait that extra three hours and turn them
right back on and start your new schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got that new timer set
from 9 to 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure any other timer you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got some pumps, some blowers,
some fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got some other stuff set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that those timers are all
adjusted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're running your lights at
night, you may want to walk around the
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that I've got a window
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my grow space was right here,
I would go outside at night and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't see any light through that
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, during the daytime, I would go in
the grow and turn off all of the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and stand in there for a few minutes and
make sure none of the sunshine is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from that window into my grow during their
new dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some things to invest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things to check and things to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think your plants will respond
and react quite well to the longer... What
[SPEAKER_00]: are we going to give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: 27 hours of darkness it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will be just fine with that
extended dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You motherfucking hog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this goes well and congratulations
on getting the wife in the garden with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be a good experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach her well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient and let her learn and then get
her listening to the podcast with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be some great family bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another message right in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to be called.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be cool for sending me all these
great messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have great correspondence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read this on the show, please don't
use my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've discovered your alias.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, by the way, your new set is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new viewer, a new watcher,
a new listener, we got some new stuff here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a fresh new table, got some new
paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to be in the new set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope you see this soon,
but it probably won't matter at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, instead of waiting to get this on the
show, I actually replied directly to our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did get an answer right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've had a major league herm issue
in my flowering tent and I can't figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what I've done to cause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some background first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cheap four by four tent and it
does have light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already named a big part of your
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheap tent light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things we can avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a better tent and not have light
leaks, but it is a completely dark room
[SPEAKER_00]: while the lights are out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hopefully, uh, hopefully it says I
have thoroughly checked this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then I'm going to believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was supposed to get a new
gorilla tent prior to the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle, but after waiting two
months for it to ride to arrive,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had a defective part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a bummer when you order grow
gear and you're on a deadline and the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: comes and it's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me started on a rant cause we
could go all day on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm supposed to get a replacement
part on Monday after only waiting another
[SPEAKER_00]: month for it to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went into flower in the old tent one
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you've got to do what we got to
do, but I think, you know, where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting likely light leaks, you've already
said that tent is cheap and has light
[SPEAKER_00]: leaks in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure that that room is completely
dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going in that room to get
something to check on something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that other room getting lit up randomly
at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the only person in the home or the
building where this happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody else is going in there and
you don't know about it and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping on the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not accusing, just mentioning options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say my setup is four HLG
quantum board panels that I run at 130
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts each at approximately 18 inches
above the tops of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four separate panels allow my
flexibility with plants of varying
[SPEAKER_00]: heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that I grow in living soil with
smaller plants in five gallon pots and the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger is in sevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed recharge and mammoth pee once a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I water two to three times a week
according to the need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with two clones of your Raphael,
two clones of Mr. Soul Cindy 99 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read the other ones
because I do know that the other ones did
[SPEAKER_00]: herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One clone of another strain, one clone of
another strain from seed and two of
[SPEAKER_00]: something else from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to tell you what didn't herm
the Raphaels and the Cindy 99s did not
[SPEAKER_00]: herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Mr. Soul, your genetics
and my genetics didn't herm in this
[SPEAKER_00]: person's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a whole list of other stuff that
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out Mr. Soul, you're doing good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says everything but these were smaller
plants and he did list some plants and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to say the names of them because
I don't need to call out these other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and other seed companies for
having hermaphroditic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says today was day 22 of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My habit is to check all of my plants on
day 15 for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also de-leaf on day 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good strategy so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pollen sacks were detected on the
plants on day 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I just had a feeling I should
check them again today and I found pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some male plants popping up
on your female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says two were so covered that I
destroyed them immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two I hoped I could save by
cutting off little limbs of the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sacks were all on the bottom half of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lower plant may herm more early,
more easily because it's not getting as
[SPEAKER_00]: much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're herming that heavily,
that quickly, it's just going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: around and I would just get rid of them
because I don't want that to cause more
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the reason I wrote is to see if I
have any chance of saving the surviving
[SPEAKER_00]: hermed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certain the pollen has been spread to
other plants, but I'm not sure how badly
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants will be seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any chance no more pollen sacks
will grow and these plants can be saved or
[SPEAKER_00]: should I just destroyed the ones that
hermed?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably keep making male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already triggered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already have that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once somebody shows you it's an asshole,
it's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to just stop being an
asshole because you want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's going to change in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to be assholes till
the day they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're probably going to keep making
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say thank you for any advice
you can give.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 2020 sucked ass and I hope I never see
another year like that again from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend used to be cool bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that your 2020 sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can make 2021 better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can fix the garden and quit
having light leaks and herm issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told him that the problem was most
likely light leaks is what I explained in
[SPEAKER_00]: an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did reply via email to get a quick
answer to my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he said I do understand that,
but can you tell me some of the major
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of hermaphroditism?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did kind of change the direction of
this message and we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I believe will lead to
intersects traits in our cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I wrote on my notes
is he's trying to save these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to cut off some branches and
rescue him and have a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said with all of the options available,
why keep troublemakers around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are asshole plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of them and have a positive
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't even waste time with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the option, I would just
call them, count your losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course your crops already seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do want to finish them out,
the crops are already going to have seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep them going, but I would
get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need troublemakers in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get rid of them immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the causes of
intersex traits, hermaphroditic plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female traits on the same plant,
possibly the same branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what causes this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically I wrote down genetics plus
environment equals expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got genetics that hold the
potential to show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give them the right environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they will express their
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring out a lot of things in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring out colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring out turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring out flavors, aromas,
structures, potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also bring out this intersex
hermaphroditic trait if the plant does
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the causes of intersex plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are just genetically intersex
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bred from plants that contain an
intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of your plants in your breeding
project has an intersex trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the opportunity to pass that
trait along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your great grandparent plant had that
trait, it might not show up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not show up in the parent,
but it may show up in the next progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be hidden for several
generations, but that intersex trait is a
[SPEAKER_00]: trait, and that comes from poorly selected
plants when breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need to be tested for intersex
traits before we breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, after seeds are made, you need to
grow them and make sure that those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't possess the intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, they shouldn't be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be grown by a private grower
in his own garden who knows what he's
[SPEAKER_00]: created, who's willing and ready and able
to take that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it is just genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else could be causing these
hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Poorly bred plants, then we put them in a
room and we give them the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental triggers that will cause our
plants to show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light interruptions in the flowering phase
are notorious for causing intersex traits
[SPEAKER_00]: in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one way that I test my plants for
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a dark period,
your dark period should be 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted light or uninterrupted
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or possibly 13 hours, depending on what
schedule you've chosen to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not interrupt that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to turn on a light or walk in
that room, you are running the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: causing intersex traits in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light leaks and light interruptions
are, in my opinion, one of the leading
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of intersex traits in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major cause is too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get these plants too hot early in
flower, you can always cause them the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to go into intersex to throw
male plants on our female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much heat is a good cause of intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root stress, overwatering, sitting in cold
water, sitting in stagnant water,
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in cold water, sitting in too warm
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things can cause stress to
the root zone, which in turn will make our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, the main goal of a cannabis
plant for the plant itself is to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to make seeds and it wants to be
grown again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants have this magical trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not pollinated, if you keep
growing them long enough, they will do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that they can to produce their
own seeds to grow next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we give these plants the triggers,
they are more than ready to create seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: on their own and continue their
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to produce big fat,
beefy buds with ripe trichomes and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas and amazing flavors and a nice
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's whole goal is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are tricking it into not reproducing by
not putting pollen near it, but the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: do hold the trait that they can unlock
within themselves to become
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient and create seeds on their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to avoid the environment and
the triggers for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't keep your plant too wet,
too cold, too dry, or in standing water
[SPEAKER_00]: for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another cause of intersex traits can
be overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we overfeed these plants, they can say,
hey, I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make some pollen sacks
and try to reproduce and make some more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and try again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overfeeding can put our plants into a
panic mode that can cause intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major cause of intersex traits is
bug infestations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen infestations in commercial grows
and private grows where they've hired me
[SPEAKER_00]: to go help, that the plants are so
stressed they are beginning to
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got bugs and the bugs are
real bad, it is time to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, get some predators in there,
or consider just chopping that shit down
[SPEAKER_00]: and starting over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're starting to see intersex traits
because your bugs are so bad, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to step up your integrated pest
management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that can cause plants to go
herm on us or show intersex traits is just
[SPEAKER_00]: basic stress, basic surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked earlier about just changing the
timer two hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants don't want that two hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommended go a long,
dark period, let them sleep, then wake
[SPEAKER_00]: them up fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep doing a bunch of random,
chaotic shit to them, drastic swings in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, drastic swings in feeding
solution temperature, drastic swings in
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, those things will trigger the
intersex traits in our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, hey, I don't know what's
going on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the end of the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something bad is going to happen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must continue our generation for the
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will figure out a way to go
hermaphrodite on you and make some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they can grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, just had to check my timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are most of the major causes of
intersex traits, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are other things that will
cause intersex traits to appear in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant holds the intersex trait,
it just depends on how strong that trait
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we see purple in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't see purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we see intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trait that can be carried in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a strong gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a not so strong gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on if you give the proper
environment to trigger that trait in that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to read one more
message before we start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I've been using
your gear for a little bit and it's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliments and I'm glad
you're having success with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm currently running a
two tent setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a four by four and a five by
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great setup so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says both are running Spider Farmer SF
400 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is stuffed with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what are the pros and cons
of taking down these two tents and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: up PandaFilm to build a five by 10 room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it better to have everyone together or
is it better to run multiple tents?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name prohibited and organic Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys go follow name
prohibited and organic Andy on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my Cannabuzz crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend has two tents and they are
wondering if they should just take down
[SPEAKER_00]: the two tents and build one big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pros and cons to both of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having one big room means you've got one
big room to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fit in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to stand up in a grow tent is a
pain in the ass for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I've got a big grow room with a
grow tent in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's weird, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a breeding room where I keep all
of the females in one section and the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant goes in a tent so that I can control
his environment separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get him flowering before everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a filter in there so I can
suck out the pollen so that the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get to my female plants too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a grow room with a grow tent
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of experience using tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of experience using
bedrooms or basements converted into grow
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a lot of experience turning
giant warehouses into grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do see the pros and cons of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the small spaces, that is less
trimming at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to set that up on a
perpetual grow, but if you've got one tent
[SPEAKER_00]: that finishes at one time and another that
finishes another, you know that these are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a veg space in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run flower in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have two different light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have one harvest at one time and
you've got two light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can have one vegging,
one flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always have 130 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: 130 days are just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have offset schedules there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two small tents,
you only need to control the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: in those two small tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you build a big room, you've got to
power the big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may need to climb and control
the two tents differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's gonna get more humid than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you moving that air around?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the tents down, you've got one
big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one constant humidity and VPD going
on in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a couple of things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier to dial in a small room
than it is to dial in a large room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got those two tents,
maybe you've got some plants that like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of humidity or plants that like real
low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put those in two different tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to reduce the light cycle
or increase the light cycle on one tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that with the two different
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do that in one big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before, I'm too fucking tall
for a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you made me grow in a bunch of grow
tents, I'm gonna get cramped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in the back are not going to
get as much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna get as much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants up front are gonna look
stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff I can't get to is going to be a
mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in a room, I can walk around every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to keep ducking and bumping
my head on shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the rooms are better for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the grow tents, that is one
more layer of protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna get as many opportunities
for light leaks like we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow tent is in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can black out the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can turn off the lights in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that you are double dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that no tent environment and
you walk into that room, you open up that
[SPEAKER_00]: door, there is a light leak in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of options to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about finding what works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that one big room that is
super comfortable, that is easy to work
[SPEAKER_00]: in, but you can't have separate light
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have separate environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get an infestation of bugs,
it's definitely in the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can contain things to one
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part about having the tent is
that you can veg in one area, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: flower in another, or you can have
staggered flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big enough room to fit the
five by five and the four by four,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would almost suggest is use the
five by five and the four by four as two
[SPEAKER_00]: staggered flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got one that starts on the first of
the month, and then wait a full month and
[SPEAKER_00]: let that flower 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of the next month, get that one
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now every 30 days, you've got a crop that
you've got the rest of that bedroom or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the room is to use as a veg and
clone and mom area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just bought yourself a veg and
clone space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flower in the two tents and use the
rest of the bedroom, the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement as the rest of your grow those
veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be under 24, 18, six of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just put them in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got your tents for 12,
12 for blackout as long as you're tents
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just created two perpetual flowering
areas that are off staggered cycles and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a full veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that were my space, I would have a
four by four, a five by five and a veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room inside of that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got full access to
the whole room or whatnot, but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having tents is good because you can
have separate environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem in one tent,
you may not have a problem in another
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do different things in different
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a longer light cycle,
shorter light cycle, or you can have one
[SPEAKER_00]: big room where it's much easier to work
and you don't need as much equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest thing is that I'm too big for
the grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just too big for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't go in there and get the,
I can't stand up in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stand up in my grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't stand up in the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like both environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with growing in
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people on social media bash
grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have bigger environments say,
oh, you're just a tent grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tents are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever let a tent discourage you,
but I'm going to read this again and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've got any more suggestions I can
make based on what you wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's going to be easier to
dial in the two tents separately for
[SPEAKER_00]: custom cultivars, but also I like the big
room because it's just easier to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, my wrap up is I would have
the two tents on staggered cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one run during the day and one
during the night so that you can have 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 in both tents and have them both
constantly flowering, which will save you
[SPEAKER_00]: on power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I used to run two five by five
tents in one room and one would come on at
[SPEAKER_00]: 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other would be 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have to upgrade the electrical
in that room and I was still able to run
[SPEAKER_00]: both of my tents with a thousand watt
light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the old antique dinosaur lights
used to run thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course now I've upgraded LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling, but again,
I would do the two tents for flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: use the rest of the room as a veg space if
that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I would stick with the two tents
because it sounds like you got good
[SPEAKER_00]: control and a layer to protect from light
leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
