[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of news articles for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the news articles,
I want to talk about something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to go, but I definitely
jumped on the internet and saw some
[SPEAKER_00]: replays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead did some shows in Santa
Clara this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a
huge Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead has a lot to do with who
I am and why I am who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Jerry Garcia fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Jamrock fan since the early
90s, probably 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to say 95 because I moved
here late 94, early 94, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, my first fish show was 69.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been listening to The Dead,
Fish, all of that stuff heavily,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily since 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole bunch of fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my best friend, Rob the Dude,
did a whole bunch of widespread panic
[SPEAKER_00]: shows one summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer tour 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did about 20 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Grateful Dead is a huge part of why
I am who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot of things on fish tour
lots and further festival parking lots and
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watched these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Grateful Dead got back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Jerry Garcia is no longer
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been gone for several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So filling in Jerry's shoes was Trey from
Fish, which you would think that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: most of Fish and Grateful Dead fan's
biggest wet dream, but it almost,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so overhyped and so big that it
just seemed weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a big commercial thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey was the dude to choose, but it was
almost, it put up so much hype and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation and so much pressure that it
was just weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watching the, I didn't go to the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have gone, but that was,
it's hella expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like it'd be right to go
take a week off to go to some shows right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did watch them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first two shows that they've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have never done a show
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the first two shows they've done
in public and they've got three more shows
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up over the 4th of July weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was totally satisfied with what I saw,
but it seemed really weird watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like watching a Grateful Dead cover
band do Grateful Dead songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't feel natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something wasn't meshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a leader to that band is
something that I think I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That band doesn't have a solid leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby's trying to lead the band,
but it doesn't seem like he's able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: control because no one wants to listen to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey seems timid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to let loose and solo like
he should.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of the second show,
it felt like everything was right,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was the end of the second show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of the weekend and
everything was wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that by the time they get to
the Chicago venue, by the time this show
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out, they will be in Chicago and
they will be setting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have already even played.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this will come out on
Thursday or Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how things go, but I hope I can
get it out for you by Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some improvement to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they talk about what didn't work
while they're on the road and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out by the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that they saved up the better
songs that they practiced for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying the set list over this
weekend wasn't amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the songs were great, but I'm
hoping that they saved up some of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey didn't sing, but for one song this
whole weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping they got more Trey songs
lined up for the Chicago shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that we get to hear Terrapin
Station with Trey on vocals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several that I would like to
hear Trey sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably boring the hell out of a
lot of my fans with my Grateful Dead talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people listening,
but the Grateful Dead is a big part of who
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead, they're going to
Chicago over the 4th of July weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next topic I have a friend named,
his name is Tim and he actually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: company that sells a product called a
torchless nail and is a torchless dab
[SPEAKER_00]: nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been very curious about this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tim was passing through, Tim does not
live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in another state, but he was
passing through my town and he was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim, if you're passing through,
dude, you're always invited here to come
[SPEAKER_00]: take some dabs at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't have cool toys with you,
even if you don't have top shelf extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, you're always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not purchase one at this time,
but I will in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's in my budget or
my need right now, but when I'm ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I'm going to grab one of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a torchless nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a dab nail that attaches to any rig
that is basically battery operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a battery pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The battery pack is kind of big and kind
of cumbersome to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the size of a remote control,
but it is heavier than a remote control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you used to drive RC cars, it's like an
old RC car battery is what it reminds me
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you plug in, this thing has a plugin
that comes undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't always have to have a cord
hanging from it, but you plug it in and it
[SPEAKER_00]: charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the coil attaches to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the coil attaches to a bowl
piece, which fits onto your bong or your
[SPEAKER_00]: rig or whatever you want to call it,
whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches to your glass piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the battery pack has a button.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hold the button that heats up an
element inside of the bowl piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes your hash, your shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we tried on it was shatter and butter
and wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not try solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't try anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only know how this works for shatter,
wax and some buttery type hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put plenty and you can stuff this
thing with plenty of hash too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of hash on there,
like probably a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you push the button and hold the
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you push it, the hash
starts melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes like, it's a very little delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start token and once you start
getting smoke into your lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you start feeling it, then I started
kind of feathering the button,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like let it go, hold it, let it go,
hold it, let it go, hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like to take a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I noticed is as soon as you let
go of the button, it stops cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as soon as you let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really control your dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the part that I was concerned with,
and it did pass my inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that before I go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that I wasn't concerned with is
we've got a wire that goes to a bowl and
[SPEAKER_00]: that bowl is heating something inside of
the bowl where I'm keeping my extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was worried about heating polyurethane
wiring or whatever was inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Tim gave me the liberty to
take this piece apart and inspect it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside of there, it's a glass bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks kind of like your normal bong
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got a health stone pipe,
it's very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glass bowl with basically a
titanium screen inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wrapped around that titanium screen
is, and we weren't sure if it was copper
[SPEAKER_00]: or brass, but wrapped around that titanium
screen is a copper or brass coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like an alligator clip or
a battery clip for your car, like where
[SPEAKER_00]: your car battery goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like that wrapped around a
titanium disc placed inside of a glass
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you press the button,
that copper or brass element essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: heats up around that titanium disc because
of the electricity flowing through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It heats up and that's what melts your
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as you let go of it,
you can touch the glass and it's not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hold the glass while you take your
dabs and it won't burn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to maybe think about
dabbing in the car on the road and you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to use the torch, this device
would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just push a little button and you
inhale and you get pretty healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty chunky rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say the torchless nail is Rasta
Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it at least a solid four
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could play with it again,
I would give it five full stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done a real full rating test or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a rating scale, but on a
scale of one to five, I'm going to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a solid four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I get to play with it a couple
more times and learn the button
[SPEAKER_00]: feathering, the technique, how much to
push and let go, that sucker just might
[SPEAKER_00]: get five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take my normal rig with me for a
day and take the torchless nail with me
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day and see which one I end up
hitting on the second day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like day one, maybe I'll get tired of
torching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe day two or day one I'll get tired of
pushing the button and just see which one
[SPEAKER_00]: I like better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's enough ranting about the
torchless nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in a torchless nail,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put you in touch with my friend who
distributes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get you the best deal
possible since I just advertised them very
[SPEAKER_00]: well on the podcast for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this, he did not pay me to say
any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought the nail to be kind,
to let me check it out because I told him
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious about the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Tim if you're
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for bringing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy late birthday, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope everything's going well for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some news articles,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On two podcasts ago, our buddy Mike was
here and we talked about a raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A raid where the police officers used a
baton ram to bash in the door of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary that the dispensary was open
and the door was unlocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they proceeded to treat all of the
customers like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nobody was committing a crime,
they were actually there to serve a cease
[SPEAKER_00]: and desist order is what they should have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead they went in, they treated
everybody like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They destroyed most of the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cops were complete assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I thought they did was completely
disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently some other people did too
because there is a news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news article comes from abc7.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this on a lot of different places,
but this article was the best written and
[SPEAKER_00]: the most understandable and it kept to the
point the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it mentioned some things that a couple
of other articles did not mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse my coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into the news article
here right after I take a quick drink and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we will get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was a long drink, but shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news article comes from abc7.com and
it is written by a man named Greg Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article was posted June 15th,
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Long Beach, California,
a lawsuit was filed Monday by attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew Papas on behalf of Sky High
Holistic, accusing Santa Ana Police
[SPEAKER_00]: Department, the city of Santa Ana and
Santa Ana Mayor Miguel Pulido of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: bribes from marijuana dispensaries in
exchange for favorable treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This following a controversial police raid
at the Marijuana Dispensary on May 26th
[SPEAKER_00]: that was caught on surveillance video and
shows police playing darts, an officer
[SPEAKER_00]: making demeaning remarks about an amputee
and another officer eating what appears to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pot-laced edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you listen to the podcast,
we watched the video last time and I'm 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that dude ate an edible right
off of the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cops ate edibles right off the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it's deplorable that city
officials and people seeking financial
[SPEAKER_00]: gain would use the police to accomplish
their self-serving goals, Papas said.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a news conference in Long Beach,
Papas outlined the lawsuit he filed in
[SPEAKER_00]: federal court.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit alleges that Padillo and other
city employees favorited certain
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries over others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Santa Ana used a lottery
system to select 20 pot shops to operate
[SPEAKER_00]: legally under a new voter approved plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawsuit alleges that at least one
dispensary which paid Pulido was selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dispensary paid for their fucking
spot in the lottery, which is shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude, allegedly, allegedly,
I have to use the word allegedly,
[SPEAKER_00]: this dude allegedly took the damn money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky High Holistic did not win a spot in
the lottery and its patients allege that
[SPEAKER_00]: because Pulido and other city employees
had financial ties with competing
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana dispensaries, they used their
positions to close down the competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: including shutting down power and water
services, the suit said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papas released an edited surveillance
video last week showing what the lawsuit
[SPEAKER_00]: describes as excessive and unreasonable
actions by police officers during the
[SPEAKER_00]: raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will agree with both of those
statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive and unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit said officers caused more than
$100,000 to video surveillance equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: safes, furniture, doors, and other
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: An internal investigation by the Santa Ana
Police Department is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retired LAPD Deputy Chief Stephen Downing
echoed the accusations at the news
[SPEAKER_00]: conference Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police officers should not behave that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unprofessional, Downing said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulido released the video statement Monday
afternoon in response to the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These allegations are unequivocally false
and the city will be responding to this
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said he has no financial interest
or stake in any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article was from the Associated
Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Associated Press did contribute to
this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to mention that part at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are suing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to file a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have filed a lawsuit against the cops
that did this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, they don't get away with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this sets a new standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this will make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't have cops raiding places and
eating edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did over $100,000 in damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they sue these guys for what,
like three or four times that because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to fix it and then
you're going to have to recoup your
[SPEAKER_00]: losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to catch up from all
the business that you've missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hope they sue them for at least
three or four times this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to another news
article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is next?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from, ooh, right here at home,
the Pueblo Chief Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Colorado workers can be
fired for using pot off duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says pot may be legal in Colorado,
but you can still be fired for using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state Supreme Court ruled five to one
Monday that a medical marijuana patient
[SPEAKER_00]: who was fired for failing a drug test
cannot get his job back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case was being watched closely by
employers and pot smokers in states that
[SPEAKER_00]: have legalized medical or recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado became the fourth state in which
courts have ruled against medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients fired for pot use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme courts in California, Montana,
and Washington state have made similar
[SPEAKER_00]: rulings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump in here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article kind of frustrated a lot of
people, but honestly, nothing has changed
[SPEAKER_00]: with this new ruling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado has always been an at will state,
which means you can be fired for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be given a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your boss can walk up and say,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fired by, here's your last
paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at any minute, you can be fired for no
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an at will state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if they did find cannabis in your
system and it was legal, they could still
[SPEAKER_00]: fire you if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just say, ha ha, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all right, let me get back into the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado worker, Brandon Coats,
is a quadriplegic who was fired by Dish
[SPEAKER_00]: Network after failing a drug test in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company agreed that Coats wasn't high
on the job, but they said they have a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats argued that his pot smoking was
allowed under a state law intended to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect employees from being fired for
illegal activities off the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats didn't use marijuana at work,
but pots intoxicating chemical THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pots intoxicating chemical THC can stay in
the system for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, these guys used chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the word chemical is
appropriate there, but we'll just let them
[SPEAKER_00]: do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go on with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado justice ruled that because
marijuana is illegal under federal law,
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats' use of the drug couldn't be
considered legal off duty activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no exception for marijuana use for
medicinal purposes or for marijuana use
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted in accordance with state law,
the court wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats and his lawyer said after the ruling
that the decision at least clarified the
[SPEAKER_00]: matters for workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm very disappointed today,
I hope that my case has brought the issue
[SPEAKER_00]: of use of medical marijuana and employment
to light, Coats said in a statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys for Dish Network and the state
of Colorado, which filed a brief in
[SPEAKER_00]: support of the company, were not
immediately available for comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 states and Washington DC allow medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington
state, and Washington DC have legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational sales, though court cases so
far have involved medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado constitution specifically
states that employers don't have to amend
[SPEAKER_00]: their policies to accommodate employees'
marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats was paralyzed in a car crash as a
teenager and has been a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patient since 2009 when he discovered that
pot helped calm the violent muscle spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a telephone operator with Dish for
three years before he failed a random drug
[SPEAKER_00]: test in 2010 and was fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he told his supervisor in advance
that he would probably fail the drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the guy's name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Brandon Coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did lose his job, but he tried to stand
up for himself and he took it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: champ, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well shit, at least we know now,
at least it's not an ambiguous law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump in right now and say
something to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on Periscope while I'm recording this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on an application called Periscope
where it's a video app where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: just watching me record and they're
throwing comments and questions at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to tell them, I'm not
watching the comments right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focused on this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need some questions to fill in some
part of the show, I may look to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: for a question or two, but I'm keeping
away from the Periscope chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, if it feels like I've been ignoring
you, I'm pretty focused on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: over here and getting this part done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to move on to one more news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been recording
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got time for one more news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys for watching on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are watching that, I do appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to be rude and make you
think I'm ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to stay with the show
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this next article,
I found this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize also for all the throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I do fat dabs and I drink
caffeine and then I talk for 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: straight and then the throat just goes to
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big chug of water and
hopefully it'll help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article comes from The Cannabis
and it is written by, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: written by our good friend Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Oregon police compare piles of
weed to a voodoo donut as visual aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you're in Oregon and
passionate about marijuana reform,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday is legitimately a mammoth day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting July 1st, adults can possess and
use, grow, and share cannabis in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shops won't be open just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes in the fall, officials think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But July 1st will represent to many the
beginning of a new era in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much marijuana will a person be
able to legally possess in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: As our handy Oregon marijuana guide says,
anyone over 21 in Oregon can possess up to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight ounces of usable marijuana,
such as dried buds at home and up to one
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce outside of the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially since weed is coming out of
a very dark and grow closet in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: an average Portlander might not know how
much cannabis makes up an ounce or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sorry, this article is written
that's all squished into one little frame
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to read it right though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps they don't have a laboratory
grade digitally calibrated scale in their
[SPEAKER_00]: desk drawer either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, everyone's got a
digi scale now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it says, fear not, legal weed
aficionados.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Portland police are here to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very straightforward and almost
sweetly maternal blog, the department
[SPEAKER_00]: encourages community members to be
responsible and considerate with
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell people that stone driving is a
crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public consumption could result in a
citation and bringing Washington bought
[SPEAKER_00]: weed into Oregon as a federal no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that last note being a bit of a
turnaround from the department's previous
[SPEAKER_00]: statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they must've went back on something
they said earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to research that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best part of the Portland police
memo, the visual aid that compares a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed to a voodoo donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the state's most celebrated
edibles, which is not, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most popular snacks in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever go there, you have to have a
voodoo donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends in Portland always talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate you guys that are eating them right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so it says, so how much weed makes
up an ounce?
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal amount you'll be able to have on
your person in Oregon, about the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: donut, if not a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that you guys, in Oregon,
you're allowed to have a donut pile sized
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get pulled over by the cops and
you got some weed on you, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much weed you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that cop going to go to his car and
pull out his donut and fucking set the
[SPEAKER_00]: donuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know the cops got a donut in the
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he going to go get a donut and set that
donut down and set it next to your urban
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, Hey, I think you're cool,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, what about eight ounces?
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal amount you're able to have at
home in Oregon, about the size of a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: of donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't completely dwarf the donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be able to climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he'd be able to climb that pile of
weed if he could climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have eight donuts worth of weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could have eight ounces,
you'd have about eight donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have a dozen donuts plus two
extra worth of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just visualize that next time you want
to know how much weed you can carry around
[SPEAKER_00]: in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, it's a genius
ploy on the police's part and the
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion of donuts inside official police
marketing material, surely isn't lost on
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone checking out the truly modern
graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes us back in fact, to when Denver's
police had some 420 friendly fun on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own, when they dropped a smart hip hop
reference on their official Twitter
[SPEAKER_00]: account on this last 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I remember that they said,
we see you rolling and we ain't hating,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they talked about all the rules
that you had to follow to smoke weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the next time I'm in Denver,
I'm definitely going to go grab myself
[SPEAKER_00]: some voodoo donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's not a line, there's always a
line at that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me read articles from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful you guys, if you go to
Oregon, make sure to get some donuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you can measure how much cannabis
you can legally possess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have one donut on your person or
eight donuts worth of weed at your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might start wrapping this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to start closing up the
show, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start closing this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some notes somewhere here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me something that really,
that really stuck to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said a good ganja farmer will never
put something off for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see it needs to be done today,
get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between growing top
shelf buds and mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never agreed with a statement
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely something that I agree
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, Spencer should be on a show
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a show about improving
your garden pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do, I'm going to try to
find a photographer to come on here and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to us about cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in, if you're local to me and
you're a cannabis photographer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for you to come on the show
and teach my listeners how to take better
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of their ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take pretty decent pictures,
but I don't think I am an experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: enough photographer to come on here and
teach everybody how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to talk about ways to
improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that Spencer will be on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll probably be an episode or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about what we're going
to do, trying to schedule that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is heavily scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie invited me over tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie made blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were freaking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie actually ran a batch of hash for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took some of my nugs and she made me
some beautiful shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on Periscope,
I'm going to hold this up to the cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made some super fire shatter for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of shout outs to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to the
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to
everybody that has started listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast who found me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to everybody who is
listening on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watching on Periscope right now,
it's super kind of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to come out on
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be back Monday with a whole
fresh episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple more news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some things I want to talk to you
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, big shout out to my Ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_12]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just really convince yourself that
that boom was fireworks this one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will probably come out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be, fuck, I won't even know the
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Monday as you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, this podcast is
brought to you by my good friends at Hygro
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two

[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you listen to Ross
DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll really help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me also mention before we go too far,
I am on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, there's an application called
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we can record everything live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm broadcasting live to, there are 10
people watching me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be hopefully a few more by the
end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever want to watch me on Periscope,
I kind of record randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't set a good schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to set a schedule so
that I can get you guys on Periscope with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start making a date of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now to the people that are on
Periscope watching, you guys, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pay attention to the comments
until toward the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to record about a 20 minute show
and then I'll open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will accept questions from my
viewers that are on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have to make this a
regular thing so that I can schedule this
[SPEAKER_00]: so that my friends and fans can get on
here and listen at the proper time and
[SPEAKER_00]: watch me on Periscope and interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tonight, this is kind of my test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to advertise that I was
going to do this because I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get bombarded and get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of this podcast,
once I do my news articles and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the email I received, I will open up the
floor for questions from my Periscope
[SPEAKER_00]: viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me keep the show going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to the sponsors, to Hygro and
our growing supplies for making the show
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in sponsoring the
show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all of the information that
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already mentioned that and I talked
about the fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since it's the first of the month,
let's jump right into this news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also the first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just read the article to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Oregon opens door to legal pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail sales still in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by Jeff Bernard from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I found it on The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the article says, Williams,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: 42 years after Oregon became the first
state to decriminalize small amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, the state is taking its first
steps along a road leading to state
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed stores selling limited amounts of
it to anyone over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon has long been a pioneer on sensible
marijuana policy, said Anthony Johnson,
[SPEAKER_00]: chief pioneer on Measure 91, which on
Wednesday makes Oregon the fourth state to
[SPEAKER_00]: adopt laws legalizing recreational use of
cannabis for people old enough to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, July 1st, 2015, the state of Oregon
has legalized recreational cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all celebrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken a dab on the show lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is grounds to take a
celebration dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you guys a couple
seconds to get a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a medium sized dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one of those big fat dabs I like to
do, because I don't want to be choking on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a show to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dab I'm going to take is in
celebration of all of my friends in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: who can now smoke and possess recreational
cannabis without worry of arrest,
[SPEAKER_00]: without any sort of trouble from the
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a dab for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on Periscope, do a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the podcast,
do a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Garden of Weeden for
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony Johnson added, though he doesn't
expect much increased demand for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: he means for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes on to say, smoking it in
public is illegal, but in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: police are discouraging residents from
calling 9-1-1 to report pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Portland chapter of national
organization for the reform of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: laws posted on its website that it would
have a tent set up at the west side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Burnside bridge for a midnight countdown
to the end of marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site offers a big neon sign in the
shape of Oregon as a background for
[SPEAKER_00]: selfies of revelers who light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can just imagine that you guys,
a big ass sign shaped like Oregon with
[SPEAKER_00]: people just dabbing out and puffing down
in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, adults will be allowed to possess
up to a half a pound and grow four plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not yet to buy or sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be a few months to more than a year
before it is legal to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only with a state permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now it says adults will be
allowed to possess up to a pound and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be allowed to grow up to four
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the last episode,
that pound or that half a pound,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, that half a pound has to stay
at home and you're allowed to carry up to
[SPEAKER_00]: one ounce with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in case you were confused,
Oregon issued a nice little statement that
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you that one ounce of cannabis is
approximately the size of one voodoo
[SPEAKER_00]: donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how much you're allowed to carry
around with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, The
legislature is considering, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the legislature is considering a bill to
allow medical marijuana dispensaries to
[SPEAKER_00]: start selling small amounts to anyone 21
and over on October 1st, in order to get
[SPEAKER_00]: over the incongruity of marijuana being
legal to have it and grow, but not to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I stumbled over that word you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A state regulated retail system is not
expected to be fully up and running until
[SPEAKER_00]: late next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are expected to be able to start
applying for licenses in January with
[SPEAKER_00]: permits for processors, wholesalers and
retailers rolling out in succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are already gearing up,
particularly in Southern Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: long known as a prime climate for outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackson County building services director,
Kelly Matting said they have received 17
[SPEAKER_00]: complaints over the past six months of
marijuana growers violating land use laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if you're going to grow cannabis and
you're going to do it out in somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: land or out in some land, be aware of what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of what you're destroying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go fucking bulldoze a lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't cut down a bunch of trees
ridiculously and irresponsibly,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially on somebody else's land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your profit and your cannabis crop comes
second to our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the legalization of recreational
marijuana, I think that we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: move to our area by people who may be from
out of state, out of the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: who don't really know or understand our
land use laws and our environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: protection, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a month, veteran medical marijuana
growers and hopeful newbies gather in the
[SPEAKER_00]: old Grange Hall in the community of
Williams to hear the latest updates on the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature's process on framing
regulations and tips on how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, happy marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really hostile business
environment, but things are improving,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Cedar Gray, the Growers Guild
president and a local home builder who,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with his wife, grow medical
marijuana and hope to move into growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today is the first day, but you cannot
buy it in a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a year before you're
able to buy cannabis in a store,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're able to grow it and it looks
like you're able to give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the fourth state to have
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on our way, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only so many states left and
they can't all fight us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes me to another thing I wanted
to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of drags me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it open on the computer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just find it again, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me an email and I answered
half of their question on a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, but I wasn't able to answer the
full question because I hadn't had time to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it, but now I've had time to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike and I brainstormed on this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read part of the question
because I've already answered part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question says, what up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Oregon and I love listening to
the Grow From Your Heart podcast while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working in my med garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you give out some great
information and tips, so I totally respect
[SPEAKER_00]: your judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really kind of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for, first of all, loving and
listening to the show and thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to it while you work in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to promote a good vibe
while you're in your garden, so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, thanks for respecting my
judgment and noticing that I give out
[SPEAKER_00]: great tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect is hard to earn and I appreciate
that you respect me and you've got my
[SPEAKER_00]: respect in turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your question says, with Oregon about
to turn recreational, I was interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: your opinion on niche business
opportunities and how recreational might
[SPEAKER_00]: affect medical rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I answered the second part of
your question, which was about trim
[SPEAKER_00]: machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me jump into the one part that I can
answer without a lot of ranting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have some that I wrote down on
the other part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, how recreational might affect
medical rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you that here in Colorado,
when we rolled out recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like we have turned our back on
medical marijuana completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given the finger to the medical
marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just how I feel about the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the industry does not care
about medical marijuana anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more demand in recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels like the medical side in
Colorado is being forgotten and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: almost attempting to eliminate it,
is what it feels like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being pushed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel that the medical rules are going
to affect your area probably very
[SPEAKER_00]: similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers are going to see more profit
in the recreational side of things and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll start getting greedy and they'll
stop giving to the patients like they have
[SPEAKER_00]: been.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compassion will go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start raising prices and
they're going to start selling everything
[SPEAKER_00]: on the commercial side of things instead
of the medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have to open up a couple of notes
that I have in my computer here because I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote a nice list of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of your question is what
are niche businesses that I think might
[SPEAKER_00]: open up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some information or tips about since
Oregon is going recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can close.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I will be able to open the next
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fighting with my computer while we're
at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So businesses and business opportunities
that will arise with recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will go for everywhere,
not just Oregon where it has just become
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational legally, recreational legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say, but this will go
along with everywhere where cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes available medically and
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses that I have seen pop up
personally that are attached to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is not a cannabis related
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you're not wanting to be in the
dispensary game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to work in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to open another business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice list of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricians, certified electricians are
getting paid huge money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an electrician and you're
willing to work with a dispensary or a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, you are making huge money right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first step I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were able to grow medical cannabis
here in Colorado, everybody built a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room in their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that had a med card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody on Periscope just made a great
recommendation and that's the next one on
[SPEAKER_00]: my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So electricians, everyone's going to need
an electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it goes commercial and
everyone's allowed to grow four,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I keep saying commercial, recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it goes recreational,
everyone's allowed to grow four plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means everyone's going to want to
build a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most houses aren't equipped to run a
couple thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone's going to need an electrician
and then shit's going to go wrong and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to want to upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more electricians all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following electricians would be HVAC
technicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the dispensaries have super fancy,
super high tech HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could design state of the art HVAC
systems for grow facilities and or
[SPEAKER_00]: residential grows, that would be very
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also construction crews that are familiar
with grow room construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a crew that knew how to build a
grow room, if you're a consultant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can design a nice grow room, and you can
have a construction crew that knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal is on building a grow room,
that would be super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HVAC electricians and construction
crews to design and build dispensary grows
[SPEAKER_00]: and personal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but there are
two or three photographers in the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scene that if you told me right
now, I need a photographer for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, is it for like an event where
we're photographing people or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: something where we're going to take
pictures of plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you said, and I'm going to give two
shout outs here, I'm going to give two
[SPEAKER_00]: huge shout outs to two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said, I want to take pictures of
cannabis plants, I would definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend a guy named Ripe Richard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the guy you want to take pictures of
your ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were taking pictures of a
cannabis event where there are people and
[SPEAKER_00]: things happening, you want Kim Sidwell of
cannabis camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just who I think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to do is become that
camera person, the photographer man,
[SPEAKER_00]: photographer woman in your area,
and master the shit out of that and market
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the new industry photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another good thing, lawyers,
cannabis lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can be a lawyer and focus on the
cannabis industry and work on either
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary rules or personal rules or
caregiver rules or whatever, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, there are all these new rules
and people are going to fuck them up and
[SPEAKER_00]: go to jail and get themselves in trouble
trying to mingle with the new rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a lawyer, help those people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a lot of schooling and you
didn't, you can't just go to a school
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, but if you're a lawyer,
and you're looking for a new niche,
[SPEAKER_00]: this could be it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also accountants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensaries have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need an accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need good marketing teams for the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need good advertising schemes and
advertising campaigns for the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Design teams to design the signs and our
booths and things like that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's not a testing facility in your
area, if Steep Hill Labs, if Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_00]: Halent hasn't already moved in in your
area, then open a testing facility or even
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're already there, open another
testing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I'm on Periscope and people
are throwing up the ideas that I've got on
[SPEAKER_00]: my list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one, but I see it and I've
got it on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ancillary businesses like head shops
and grow stores, you guys, like Hygro
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are aiming at the outdoor and
indoor farmer that is producing tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this cannabis business is also
boosting their sales ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a grow store, a head shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the dispensaries have smoking
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have dab rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have papers, but it's grossly
overpriced in that son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you opened up a head shop down the
street from a dispensary and sold things
[SPEAKER_00]: at a decent markup, you would make money
because people will know that this
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary charges me good price for weed,
ridiculous prices for glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to the glass shop and buy
my smoking accessories there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just wrote on Periscope,
they said security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security guards are always needed at the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need security guards for our grows,
for the dispensaries, for all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to make packaging,
if you can design packaging, if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging person, that sort of stuff is
needed in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that people overlook is
clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, cannabis clothing, locally aimed
cannabis clothing sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your state, if you can make
your state flag into something kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-y, then that will sell in your
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Web design.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the dispensaries need some sort of
web design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that Colorado specializes in,
we have something called a compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run a dispensary or work in a
dispensary or own a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything has to be done under a certain
set of rules that are set by the MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need one or two people that know all
of those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ask them a question,
it's their job to go in the office and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the book and figure out that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your compliance specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he needs to be finding out all of the
new rules as they come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to be walking through the grow,
through the sales area, through all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and making sure that everything
is under compliance so that if the
[SPEAKER_00]: inspectors come in, you are cool and legit
and he keeps you out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dispensaries need assistance from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a taxi service of some sort would be
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you can open, this is the obvious
one, if you can open a smoking club,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be cool as shit, but the rules
are always going to be strict for that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have seen is a lot of smoking
buses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the cannabis tour bus because
it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the rules on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to find out that in your area,
but a taxi service of some sort would be
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transportation for intoxicated people
makes you look good and it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a service around here that
actually hires specifically for
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a temp agency and you go and apply
and you have to get your MED badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've got your MED badge,
they send you to a dispensary and you work
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it could lead to permanent
employment, just like a normal job at a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal temp agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're designed specifically for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could open your own temp agency to
hire people for the dispensaries so that
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary owners and managers don't have
to spend their day interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send these people to the dispensary,
they work, they get paid a certain amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of money, and then you take a dollar or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make sure that they get paid minimum
wage, but then you take a dollar or a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of whatever they get paid to make
your business work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that happens around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there'll be a need for
lodging, hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotels will be serious when cannabis goes
recreational in your area because people
[SPEAKER_00]: will be coming from afar to the nearest
dispensaries to get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we get people, we're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get people from Texas, Wyoming,
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from all over to get weed from
us here and they're filling up the hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come take weekend trips just to
buy weed all over and they'll have to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in a hotel somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of things that you guys
could, those are business opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could open somewhere to actually
consume cannabis in your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be ideal because here you can
buy weed at 13 different places within 10
[SPEAKER_00]: miles of each other, but there's nowhere
to legally consume your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big ass list of ancillary and
niche businesses that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in without opening up your own
cannabis, but you could still capitalize
[SPEAKER_00]: on this cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's those little hippie stores
that sell like hippie clothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like patchwork pants and tight-eyed
t-shirts and fucking hemp jewelry and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you open one of those near a
dispensary and you capitalize on that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis theme, and like I said earlier,
if you use your state or your city and
[SPEAKER_00]: weed out your slogan, like my logo for
iReGenetics is the Colorado flag that's
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into the Rasta colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't even know about the
company when they see it and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, I love that shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take your state flag or your city logo
or whatever and turn it into some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis theme to flag and make a spoof of
it and sell that in your store in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would sell, that would crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone on a long time about this
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink of root beer and
then we're going to actually check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been on Periscope the entire time
I've been recording and I told those
[SPEAKER_00]: people on Periscope that we would take
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that we have 17 people on Periscope
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, I'd like to go about nine or
eight more minutes in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if Periscope has got any questions for
me, please type in your questions while I
[SPEAKER_00]: take a drink and I will read my favorite
questions and then I'll try to answer them
[SPEAKER_00]: the best that I can for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I take a drink, you guys start
typing your questions there on Periscope
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny because usually Periscope is
filled with questions and now they seem
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're stumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier on Periscope, somebody asked me,
what is the difference between wax and
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I am not the hash maker here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my experience from watching and
hearing my hash maker friends talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between wax and shatter,
most BHO, okay, somebody asked me a
[SPEAKER_00]: question there and I'm going to write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about smoking and driving?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask that and we're going to
answer that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing it down, smoke and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was answering the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between wax and
shatter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically when you make BHO, if it's done
right, they'll both come out very near,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's done right, it'll come out very
near shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consistency will be very near shatter
if not sappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, if you vacuum purge it
properly and don't mess with it too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will stay shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is more like, sorry, I'm burping
after my drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is like a Jolly Rancher
consistency where it's kind of snappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll break.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we call it shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you chip at it too hard, it'll shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most hash, most BHO ran properly will
turn into shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the way that you make it into wax,
is right before it cools, how tight's the
[SPEAKER_00]: open container law?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me a question on Periscope
that said, how tight's the open container
[SPEAKER_00]: laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not experienced with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my area, they don't give a shit,
but in some areas they really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me continue with my shatter versus
wax part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got this shatter,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could turn that into wax by
heating it or before you even let it warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep it warm, before you let it cool,
keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is whip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what they use to whip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a few things like, I saw one guy
use a metal pick like for your Afro,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it had four or five little fingers
coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess their teeth, if they're on the
pick, but he would put that in the Pyrex
[SPEAKER_00]: dish of hash and just stir it around
really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he was trying to do is whip it
like he was stirring some kind of food and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to put air into it and make it
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that does is it fluffs it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it dries, there's air
trapped in there and it just dries up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the science behind why,
but it makes it waxy and it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they put that in the vac oven just
like they do the shatter and they clean it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that's not the most technical
answer, but the main difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: wax and shatter is the whipping action
that happens right before it's finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just whip it up and put a little bit
of air in it and it makes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody on Periscope says, keep the vac
at 120 and it will bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but 120 is a little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start burning off turps is
about 106, 110-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody asked me how I feel about
smoking and driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot advocate you smoking cannabis and
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say to do that, but again,
I can't be a hypocrite because I do it
[SPEAKER_00]: myself occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I feel about it is if you know your
limits and you're not going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: dipshit out there on the road and you're
not fucked up, drive if you've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're the kind of person that
smokes and goes full retarded,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get behind the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check yourself before you hurt somebody or
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I really feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be a hypocrite if I came on here
and I said, don't take dabs and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't take dabs and drive
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to smoke in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't be that asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the news article about you
when you fuck up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what you're doing and say,
huh, I'm about to be a news story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I crash into somebody right now while
I'm smoking this bong in the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be on the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be a black eye for the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I don't want to get pulled over while
I'm taking this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to get blazed before you
drive and you can handle it and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: an idiot, that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drink a drop of alcohol and drive
because I'm a hypocrite maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel alcohol really fucks with your
equilibrium, your balance, your depth and
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really fucks you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a medical marijuana
consumer, you've got a tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're experienced, and you're not smoking
it just to get retarded high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking just to get retarded
high, don't drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let somebody drive for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call an Uber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Periscope, do you have one more
question for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be perfect to get one more question
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Periscope, they're sending me a
bunch of hearts, which means they got love
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it technically illegal to drive high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is technically illegal to drive
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's driving under the influence of
drugs or driving with ability impaired,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how they book you or how they
write it down or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the difference would be,
but it is absolutely illegal to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: DUI, somebody on Periscope says DUI,
it's driving under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, don't be high when you're
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the cops ask you how long ago you
smoked, say six hours ago, be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been at least six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're smoking a joint in the car,
if you got a blunt burning, that's no
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm waiting for Periscope to
throw up one more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't throw up one more question,
we will start closing up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my favorite part of my job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, open container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So favorite part of my job, an open
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write down the open
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny because I wrote down open
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get involved in the biz?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now guys, slow down with the questions
because I've got one that I wrote down and
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me what my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing all this shit down guys,
because I got to go fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I work in MJ?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to answer these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you throw up more questions,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably won't get to them unless it's a
really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my favorite part of my job?
[SPEAKER_00]: My job is to provide the best quality
cannabis that I can for the customers at
[SPEAKER_00]: the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other job is to provide the best
quality cannabis that I can for the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana patients, which have
designated me as their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of my job is to host a
podcast that teaches other people how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow better cannabis to improve the
quality of their own lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big part of my job that people
don't realize is I'm a father,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I am shaping somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm creating another person into what I
hope to be a successful and happy human
[SPEAKER_00]: being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the favorite part of my job is helping
other people out and seeing the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that the work I do has on other
people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, I grow weed and I'm a
dad and play on Instagram and I play on
[SPEAKER_00]: Periscope and it feels like I'm just
playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big man child because my job is what
I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't feel like I'm working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there may be my favorite
part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like I'm working ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be completely sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question, but I'm probably
not going to get to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Text that to me on Twitter and I'll answer
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I do play the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of things and I think my
favorite part of my job is seeing people
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got a patient named Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a 60 year old guy and he feels like
shit half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grow cannabis that I know he loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to his house and I roll up a big
fat joint or I give him a dab and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey, Doug, let's hang out and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get there, he's hurt or sick
and depressed and he's got a shitty look
[SPEAKER_00]: on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I leave, the dude's got a
smile on his face and he loves the world
[SPEAKER_00]: and he loves life again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is my interaction with
the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a large portion of that is the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a large portion of that is the
cannabis that I grew from my heart and
[SPEAKER_00]: gave to this whole guy to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably the favorite part of my
job is that I get, I'm healing people,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the people that are smoking cannabis
recreationally, it's healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels better to take a fat puff of
ganja and blow out that smoke and just
[SPEAKER_00]: feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to do that to people every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see that it is all in the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody asked me, what's my favorite
part?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see people improve their lives
with, from my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes me feel golden inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me about an open container
law here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've started treating cannabis
like alcohol is our new model here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got what's called the open
container law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I am not up to date on the
open container law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my city, you can drive around with your
dab rig on the dash.
[SPEAKER_00]: My city is a little bit gangster and
nobody cares what you're doing here,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you're not shooting at each
other when you drive by.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other places, you've got to have your
stuff in a childproof container or a
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed container in your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got to be out of your reach and
in the trunk, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my vehicle doesn't have a trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it in my backpack and then I put
it in the backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite often, honestly, there's a dab
rig in my center console.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm driving from here to Rave's
house, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put the dab rig in the center
console and put my hash, my carb cap,
[SPEAKER_00]: my torch in there, and I drive over to
Rave's and I carry it into the house and I
[SPEAKER_00]: take a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, I don't know enough about
that open container law to be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a lawyer, so don't follow my
advice on that shit at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked, how do I get to work in
the marijuana industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start by a applying for
your... If you're coming to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to start by applying for your
marijuana enforcement division badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which website it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have time to research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you search it, how do I find my
marijuana enforcement badge for Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a list of instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill out the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to be fingerprinted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll let you know if you pass
that background check or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is the badge?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two levels of badges.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is $100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is $150, and one is $300.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to take a check.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not accept cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to make an appointment,
download the application, fill out the
[SPEAKER_00]: application, make an appointment to go,
get a check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it's a money order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a check or a money order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a money order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a money order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get yourself a money order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will... That's a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked me, what's allowed to
be on your background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, no drug felonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got college loans and shit,
you got to start... You have to be in good
[SPEAKER_00]: standing with all of your college loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your child support has to be up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fucking around, they're going to
want to know why you're fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the application filled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the thing to do is hit every
dispenser you can with a resume and
[SPEAKER_00]: explain to them why you're the employee
that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not experienced in the
cannabis industry here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be difficult getting your
foot in the door because the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: are full.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been employed there for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can get into the
cannabis industry with marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do not know the... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that right on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would have prepared that question,
I would have researched it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're doing it right off the
cuff here, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you get your badge and then you
come here and then you apply, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you get somebody's attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably going to have to start
by being like a tremor or a bud tender or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would learn how to trim weed is
probably where you're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: because unless you're a master grower and
you can prove it, nobody's going to let
[SPEAKER_00]: you start off being a master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be an hourly tremor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So work on your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start learning how to trim weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to be chipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow some boobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it, but dispensaries will
hire you if you have got some boobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cute 22, 25 year old chick and
you can flirt with the customers and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can sell them some shit, there's a good
chance you're going to get a job in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enough of my Periscope questions
for today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much on Periscope for asking
questions and participating in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that aren't on Periscope that are
just listening on iTunes or Stitcher or

Periscope videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do about one Periscope, maybe two videos

[SPEAKER_00]: I take some dabs and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said, let me trim for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you teach me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you on a video one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do some Periscope and trim on the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim on Periscope quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys that are listening,
if you want to check it out, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: really fun to see you on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start scheduling podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to schedule when I'm
going to record because I don't know when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get home and how my life is
going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I just pick a time, it will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody just said, thanks for all of
my hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's very welcome for all the hard

weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a bunch of good fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a safe weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody lost any fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody got too drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody had a major hangover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything went well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the 5th of July, I'm going to brag a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would you guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see Mr. Doug Benson at
ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug was in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did another standup comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, he really redeemed
himself from the last show that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to this podcast regularly,
you know that I kind of bashed Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson's last performance at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also kind of bashed his album.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a much better performance this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a little bit of a cough,
which may have worked to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug wasn't smoking as heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was a little bit under the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it led to him having a better
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug did make a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Doug walked out on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing Doug said was,
hey, you know it's a Doug Benson show
[SPEAKER_00]: because Rasta Jeff is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I was sitting right in the
front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got those two VIP seats always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he started talking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pulled out a handful of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, I got my jokes here in
my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked me straight in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, Rasta Jeff knows what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys listen to this podcast,
I called Doug out on his pocket full of
[SPEAKER_00]: disheveled notes on another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am wondering if Doug listens to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Doug, if you're listening,
dude, great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're getting over that cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been watching your Periscope
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at ComedyWorks that weekend or the
same day, opening for Doug Benson was my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Engaio Belem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know Engaio Belem,
make sure you check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is spelled N-G-A-I-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Engaio420 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you search him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cannabis connoisseur like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may hint at a future collaboration
between the two of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk too much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there may be some stuff being talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does live in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to deal with
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are going to try and do some shit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say Engaio crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engaio did probably 20 minutes,
maybe 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like he went on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he definitely tore it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to be 15 or 20 minutes because I'm
sure he didn't do more than that being an
[SPEAKER_00]: opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me laugh my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson was equally hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen Doug so many times that when
he starts into a vibe, I know which jokes
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming out of this clump of like this
part of the show is going to be this clump
[SPEAKER_00]: of jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vibe will change because he's
very interactive with the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of crowd work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know all of Doug's jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little predictable for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go for the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go for the smoke session before and
after, of course, because that's always a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enough bragging about my weekend at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to Mr. Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to Engaio
Beelum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big huge shout out to ComedyWorks,
the greatest comedy venue on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always gets me the hookups at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a big shout out to my beautiful
date, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a wonderful date.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to going to more comedy
shows with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might sneeze here in a minute,
but we're just going to push on through
[SPEAKER_00]: until that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get into a little bit of
news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I woke up the other day and I got
on the internet here and I see my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddyup's face plastered all over the damn
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Giddyup
and Too Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been, if you guys follow the show,
you've been hearing about the raid that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in Santa Ana, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager of that dispensary was in a
wheelchair and she was blind and she has
[SPEAKER_00]: an amputee putated leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been getting a lot of media
coverage and recently it was discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: that her wheelchair was, her electric
wheelchair was kind of falling apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was held together mainly by duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there were a couple of people that
thought that a lady in her position
[SPEAKER_00]: deserved better than a duct tape
wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Giddyup from Emotech and Too Short got
together and bought this lovely lady a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big, huge personal
shout out to Giddyup and to Too Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That represents two industries that are
always looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rap industry has always looked at like
a bunch of gangsters and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has looked at like a bunch of
drug dealers, but look what two of our
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives did.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I read, that wheelchair was
about $4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not pocket change for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good deed done by our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out to Giddyup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to Giddyup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddy actually sent me my Gmail that I use
and there's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do whatever you can to support Emotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them a thank you, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another news article on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to decide which one I want to
read first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both, let's see, let's go to this
one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I was just browsing through news
sites and I came across this and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that the world would like to hear about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, do medical marijuana
users have right to bear arms?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, says the ATF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, there are no exceptions
in federal law for marijuana purportedly
[SPEAKER_00]: used for medicinal purposes, ATF official
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by Matt Voltz and it's
from the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Helena, Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, firearms dealers in states that
allow medical marijuana can't sell guns or
[SPEAKER_00]: ammunition to registered users of the
drug, a policy that marijuana and gun
[SPEAKER_00]: rights groups say deny second amendment
rights to individuals who are following
[SPEAKER_00]: state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law already makes it illegal for
some one to possess a gun if he or she is
[SPEAKER_00]: an unlawful user of or addicted to
marijuana or other controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: A September 21st letter from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
[SPEAKER_00]: Explosives issued in response to numerous
inquiries from gun dealers clarifies that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana patients are included in
that definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no exceptions in federal law for
marijuana purportedly used for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, even if such use is sanctioned
by state law, said the letter by Arthur
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbert, the ATF's assistant director for
enforcement programs and services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal firearms licensees or FFLs can't
sell a gun to someone who answers yes when
[SPEAKER_00]: requested forms asked whether the buyer is
a controlled substance user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a tricky, that's
bullshit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to keep reading on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasonable cause to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's letter also says that licensed
dealers can't sell a gun or ammunition if
[SPEAKER_00]: they have reasonable cause to believe the
buyer is using a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes if the buyer presents a
medical marijuana card as identification
[SPEAKER_00]: or if the buyer talks about drug use,
having a medical marijuana card or a
[SPEAKER_00]: recent drug conviction, ATF spokesman Drew
Wade said Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are no new obligations and
licenses for medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Court of Appeals and the Oregon
Supreme Court said the state law
[SPEAKER_00]: authorizes concealed handgun permits and
separate from the federal law that outlaws
[SPEAKER_00]: gun possession by drug users and the state
gun law doesn't address medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm reading ahead of myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Montana Raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal authorities also raided dozens of
medical marijuana operations across
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana this spring, chilling a once
booming pot industry and leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeping changes in Montana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Justice followed up with
a warning letter to political leaders in
[SPEAKER_00]: many states that federal prosecutors will
pursue marijuana distributors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not individual patients who are
following state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter the ATF sent to gun dealers
last week was first reported by Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: newspapers of Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perl marijuana and gun groups said the
policy clarification amounts to rescinding
[SPEAKER_00]: the gun rights for the thousands of people
licensed to use medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears to contradict the 2009
Department of Justice memo that said Obama
[SPEAKER_00]: administration would not pursue
prosecution of individual medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana users who obey state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beside that, the government is putting an
additional burden on gun dealers to police
[SPEAKER_00]: their customers, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana said Montana Shooting Sports
Association, Gary Marbutt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their business is to be merchants,
not to be cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the federal licensing
scheme complicates that, Marbutt said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds as if the ATF is expecting them
to drift further into that cop role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine that you guys now that
if you're a gun seller, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: just follow that paper, you actually have
to like talk to everybody and try to act
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're the cops also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are going to be a bunch of
vigilantes that are going to see somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: like I bet if I went into a gun store,
they would deny me a sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I never figured out this question
or filled out this questionnaire,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd say you're a pothead, you cannot
buy a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is now up to vaguely up to the
store owner or the salesperson,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep reading the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protecting America from criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wade said both the 2009 memo and last
week's letter were approved by the Justice
[SPEAKER_00]: Department and he does not believe there
is a contradiction in the two messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also that the dealers are in good
position to help prevent firearms from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must have omitted a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say he also said that the
dealers are in a good position to help
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent firearms from getting into the
wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FFLs aren't cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are at the front line of protecting
America from criminals or people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited from possessing firearms,
Wade said.
[SPEAKER_00]: A salesman at once licensed firearms
dealer, Montana Outdoor Sports and Helena
[SPEAKER_00]: said he doesn't expect much to change as a
result of the letter because it's largely
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the buyer to reveal whether he or
she is a medical marijuana user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to say yes to that,
asked Damon Peters, a sales associate for
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and a license-hunting guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of users of medical marijuana aren't
really shooting sports enthusiasts anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we may see a sailor too lost,
but I don't see anything dramatic that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to affect us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, so there's a lot of talk about
guns going on in our country later lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I support guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they took away all the guns,
the only people that would have guns would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the bad guys, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the way that works,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the guns were illegal deal,
like the criminals aren't going to care
[SPEAKER_00]: that the guns are illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be like, oh,
here's my guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to, that's bullshit of a
theory, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what's happening is if you're a
medical marijuana patient, you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to purchase a firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of shit is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because, so here's another side of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be a Vicodin patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be a Valium patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be maybe some sort of
anti-depressant user, patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you call the person that's taking
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm able to buy a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take my Vicodin, my Ritalin,
my Valium, my Ambien.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else could I take possibly to go
with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: My Celebrex and my Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a Boner pill, because everybody
has got to have a Boner pill, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take all of those and then I could
go buy a gun, but I can't use my medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to ease my pain a little bit or
help my appetite and then purchase a
[SPEAKER_00]: firearm to either protect my home or hunt
for food or just have it because I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: good old American and I should have a damn
gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a ridiculous law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that everybody should be made
aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what we can do about it,
but I thought it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are kind of right though about the
people that smoke medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: not wanting to be hunters and shooters,
but this is Colorado and you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised the diversity of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends who have dreadlocks,
who snowboard on the one weekend and who
[SPEAKER_00]: will go elk hunting the next weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be wrong with their assumptions
on who is hunting and who is using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much in this article that we
could bitch about, but instead let's move
[SPEAKER_00]: on to a little bit more of a positive
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from the Washington
Post and it is written by a guy named
[SPEAKER_00]: Radley Balko and the headline is,
since marijuana legalization, highway
[SPEAKER_00]: fatalities in Colorado are at a near
historic low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, let me read this article for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, since Colorado voters legalized
pot in 2012, prohibition supporters have
[SPEAKER_00]: warned that recreational marijuana will
lead to a scourge of drugged drivers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the state's roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often point out that when the state
legalized medical marijuana in 2012,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2001, there was a surge in drivers found
to have smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also point to studies showing that in
other states that have legalized pot for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal purposes, we've seen an increase
in the number of drivers testing positive
[SPEAKER_00]: for the drug who were involved in fatal
car accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anti-pot group, SAM, recently pointed
out that even before the first legal pot
[SPEAKER_00]: store opened in Washington state,
the number of drivers in that state
[SPEAKER_00]: testing positive for pot jumped by a
third.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with these criticisms is that
we can test only for the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana metabolites, not for
inebriation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metabolites can linger in the body for
days after the drug's effects wear off,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes even for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very heavy, I'm going to chime in
myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very heavy cannabis user and a long
time ago, this had to be nearly 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, I was trying to get a good job that
would have paid very well and had some
[SPEAKER_00]: great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I quit smoking cannabis and all I
had to do is pass one drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this place did was one pre-hire
screening and then I would have been home
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have worked there forever and
never had to pee test again unless I hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, in which case I would have just
walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went 30 days and I took a voluntary
pee test that you can buy at the store and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went 45 days and took a pee test and I
was still dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went 60 days and I took a pee test and I
was still dirty, but I already had my
[SPEAKER_00]: interview scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 63 days in, I went and took a pee test
and the doctor called me back and told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that I still had more than 1400 nanograms
per whatever their measurement was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more than their limit of THC in my
urine after 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me if I was taking
prescription Marinol or what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him that I hadn't smoked in
nine weeks and he was a little bit blown
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're saying that metabolites can
linger in the body for days, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: even weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went nine weeks and there was still
cannabis in my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you that on day 64,
I took a fat bong hit and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever been that fucking high in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna continue on with the
article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, because we all metabolize drugs
differently and at different times and
[SPEAKER_00]: under different conditions, all that
positive test tells us is that the driver
[SPEAKER_00]: has smoked pot at some point in the past
few days or weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense that loosening restrictions
on pot would result in a higher percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of drivers involved in fatal traffic
accidents having smoked the drug at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point over the past few days or weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also expect to find that a higher
percentage of church growers, good
[SPEAKER_00]: Samaritans and soup kitchen volunteers
would have pot in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It expect a similar result among any large
sampling of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't necessarily mean that
marijuana caused or was even a
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing factor to accidents,
traffic violations or fatalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't an argument that pot wasn't a
factor in at least some of those accidents
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's precisely the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A post accident test for marijuana
metabolites doesn't tell us much about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether pot contributes to the accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the new Colorado law took effect in
January, the drug driver panic has only
[SPEAKER_00]: intensified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already written about one dubious
example in which the Colorado Highway
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrol and some local and had some local
and national media perpetuated a story
[SPEAKER_00]: that a driver was high on pot when he
slammed into a couple of police cars
[SPEAKER_00]: parked on an interstate exit ramp.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the driver did have some pot in his
system, his blood alcohol level was off
[SPEAKER_00]: the charts and was far more likely the
cause of the accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we've seen a few
times here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people will be on other drugs,
they'll be drunk and they'll get in an
[SPEAKER_00]: accident and they'll have a little bit of
cannabis in their system and they blame
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they overlook the fact that this guy
was on four hits of acid, that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: tweaking his brains out, that he had
mushrooms in his brain, but he smoked a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that had to have been what sent him
over the edge and made him crash his car.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to go a little bit
more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my colleague Mark Fisher's recent
dispatch from Colorado, law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: officials there and in bordering states
warned that they're seeing more drug
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress recently held hearings on the
matter complete with dire predictions such
[SPEAKER_00]: as we're going to have a lot more people
stoned on the highway and there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences from Rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Micah of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have called for a zero tolerance
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're driving with any trace of pot in
your system, you're guilty of a DWI.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would effectively ban anyone who
smokes pot from driving up to a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after the last joint, including
people who legitimately use the drug for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, that means that I would never be
able to drive again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what that shit says.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that any medical cannabis user in
Colorado would not be able to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess now you can't drive or have a
gun is the two articles that I've read
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police state much with a question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to read more of the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that the best way to gauge
the effect legalization has had on the
[SPEAKER_00]: roadways is to look at what happened on
the road since legalization took effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a month by month comparison of
highway fatalities in Colorado through the
[SPEAKER_00]: first seven months of this year and last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a more thorough comparison,
I've also included the highest fatality
[SPEAKER_00]: figures for each month since 2002,
the lowest for each month since 2002,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the average for each month since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a graph here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know graphs don't do you any good on the
podcast, but we're going to look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high since 2002, they are showing...
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are one, two, three, four,
five lines on this graph, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it is showing you that shit
has gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, as you can see, roadway
fatalities this year are down from last
[SPEAKER_00]: year and down from the 13 year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the seven months so far this year,
five months saw a lower fatality figure
[SPEAKER_00]: than the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two months saw a slightly higher figure
this year and in one month the two figures
[SPEAKER_00]: were equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add up the total fatalities from
January through July, it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see... It's a down
sloping graph, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take my word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a down sloping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts high and it goes low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll read the rest of the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, here, the high bar... And he
says, pardon the pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high bar is what you get when you add
the worst January since 2002 to the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: February to the worst March and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The low bar is the sum total of the safest
January, February, et cetera, since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's notable here is that the total so
far in 2014 are closer to the safest
[SPEAKER_00]: composite year since 2002 than to the
average year since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also add here that these are
total fatalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to calculate these figures as a
rate, say miles driven per fatality,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drop would be starker, both for this
year and since Colorado legalized medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the number of miles Americans drive
annually has leveled off nationally since
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid-2000s, the number of total miles
traveled continues to go up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to measure by rate, then the
state would be at lows unseen in decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're driving even more is what he's
saying, and we are crashing even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The figures are similar in states that
have legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: While some studies have shown that the
number of drivers involved in fatal
[SPEAKER_00]: collisions who test positive for marijuana
had steadily increased as pot has become
[SPEAKER_00]: more available, other studies have shown
that overall traffic fatalities in those
[SPEAKER_00]: states have dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because the pot tests only measure
for recent pot use, not inebriation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing inconsistent about those
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the continuing drop in roadway
fatalities in Colorado and elsewhere is
[SPEAKER_00]: due to a variety of factors such as better
built cars and trucks, improved safety
[SPEAKER_00]: features, and better road engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These features in and of themselves only
indicate that the roads are getting safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't suggest that pot had anything
to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only seven months in, maybe these
figures will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, it's also possible that if it
weren't for a legal pot, the 2014 figures
[SPEAKER_00]: would be even lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real way to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only look at the data available,
but you can bet that if fatalities were up
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, prohibition supporters would be
blaming it on legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, though road fatalities have
generally been falling in Colorado for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, 2013 actually saw a slight
decrease from 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fatalities are down at the year after
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: After having gone up the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, some researchers have
gone so far as to suggest that better
[SPEAKER_00]: access to pot is making the road safer,
at least marginally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory is that people are substituting
pot for alcohol and pot causes less driver
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment than booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see more studies before I'd be
ready to endorse that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's also some research
contradicting the theory that drinkers are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to substitute pot for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit drinking completely when I got my
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said to myself, I'm able to go to the
store and buy cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could buy all the herb I want because
before you'd have to wait for your dude to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some, or you'd have to grow your own,
or you'd have to wait for your crop to be
[SPEAKER_00]: ready, or you'd hope one of your bros had
a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got my medical marijuana card
and I could just smoke down and then go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and buy some more, and then
smoke down, and when I ran out,
[SPEAKER_00]: just go to the store tomorrow,
I didn't even need to drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had alcohol in so many years,
and now I smoke all the cannabis I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to drink when I can smoke
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but the data are far more
supportive of that than the claims that
[SPEAKER_00]: stone drivers are menacing Colorado's
roadways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he said ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to change that to compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crossing it out on the keyboard screen
or on the computer screen or writing
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, even here, there are
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular users can still have remnant THC
in their blood well after the effects have
[SPEAKER_00]: worn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular users can also have levels above
the legal limit and still drive perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, a THC level of five nanograms
or more brings a presumptive charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: driving under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, references to marijuana related
accidents and studies by prohibitionists
[SPEAKER_00]: and law enforcement could refer to any
measure or trace of the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when officials and legalization
opponents talk about increases in these
[SPEAKER_00]: figures, it still isn't clear what any of
this means for road safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I need to take a quick drink,
excuse me, for one minute, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: will talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting dry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we have legalized cannabis,
the traffic has been safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get drunk, you drive recklessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blacked out and you're just driving
and getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care what lane you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care what direction you're
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't even know where the
hell you're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're high, you're just calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look twice and you go a little bit
under the speed limit because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to cruise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put the music at a comfortable
level and you want to watch everything
[SPEAKER_00]: come at you at a decent pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never get too crazy when I'm
driving high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit that when I was a youngster,
I would drive a little bit drunk and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was some scary shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never been scared of myself driving
high, but I have scared the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: myself driving too drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll never happen again because I don't
drink alcohol so I can talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's see how far
into this show we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're already 27 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last article took a little longer
than I had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we go ahead and wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm really trying to get Matty
and Spencer on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been a couple of busy suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just had a big fat harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just pulled their first round of
seeds from their first breeding run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting ready for the 710 party at
the Lazy Lion this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll be available tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get them on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of cool stuff written down
to talk to them about.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go any further, I do want to
give a huge, huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Kind Pain Management in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not supporters of the show,
but what they are doing is they are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing lemon Jeffrey, which is a strain I
bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that together and I got some seeds
in their hands and they are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have posted some lab tests up on
their Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hitting over 26% THC on the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part is it is on shelves now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can head to Kind Pain Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a medical and a recreational
facility, so anybody can grab some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some lemon Jeffrey, check out what I bred,
check out what Kind Pain Management did
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to do on this podcast is
check out a video that somebody sent to me
[SPEAKER_00]: of three ex cops smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the video is six minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to watch the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may edit parts of this out of the
podcast so that you guys don't have to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: through six whole minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may skip through parts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how my ADD kicks in as we do
this, but I think this is a great video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to watch parts of it and then
we will talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me kill the theme song and we're
going to play this cops smoking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it starts off with some dubstep music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that's called,
but some really, some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows three older dudes,
old enough to be our fathers, taking bong
[SPEAKER_00]: rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I smoked was in probably
1968 when I was in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time I smoked, I was 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got caught the first time I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and for some reason, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tried it once and tell you I was on a
water bed with a very agreeable woman and
[SPEAKER_05]: listening to Rhapsody in Blue,
which I know lasts for about 18 minutes
[SPEAKER_05]: and 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it lasted for, oh hell, two or three
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all three of these ex cops have just
admitted to having used cannabis illegally
[SPEAKER_00]: in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what they're doing is taking a
field sobriety test before they smoke any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are three retired cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all know how to fuck with each other
and give each other a sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one old guy has got such shitty old
knees that he can barely pass the heel to
[SPEAKER_00]: toe walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this says also that it was recorded in
Washington where cannabis is legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're keeping these cops out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cop number one now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in plain clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look like cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their facial hair looks like cops,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plain clothes guy number one is now
hitting the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the presenter of the video light it
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I graduated from WSU in 1970 and went to
work right in the same year and didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: retire until 97.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this old dude's taking a pretty fat
bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is David.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a reserve police officer from 1997
through 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second dude took a pretty nice bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Robert.
[SPEAKER_05]: Went to police academy in the fall of 1970
and worked until the fall of 1986.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, I taught as a
freelance trainer, mostly for the criminal
[SPEAKER_05]: justice training commission, taught at the
police academy for nine or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, none of these guys knew how to carb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all taken a couple of fat bong
hits and now it's starting to kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one guy just said, so now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the fun starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clock shows you five minutes have gone
by and we'll let you hear what they say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I thought about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I can remember, I never
arrested anyone for it, but I took a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of pot away from people and threw it away
in front of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was a bigger deterrent
than actually writing a criminal citation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should be more widely available
for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the last piece of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite part, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pause it because the host is
a little bit hard to hear on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: His audio is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the guy just asked these cops is,
do you think marijuana is a gateway drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to back up about just a
couple of seconds here, because this is
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly my favorite part of the video is
this guy's answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just asked them, do you think
marijuana is a gateway drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll hit play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it certainly can be a gateway
drug.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to respond to that too,
because if you look at it, everyone who's
[SPEAKER_05]: a heroin addict started out drinking milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's the argument about
marijuana and I'm not sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that guy just said that milk is the
gateway drug, you guys, because everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that does heroin started off drinking
milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he really feels that way
or if he's just too high and hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: high in years, and that's what just came
out of his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was my favorite statement from
this whole video was hearing that cop say
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody that is on heroin started
off using milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So milk is the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the one cop said he's never arrested
people, but he's taken a lot of weed away
[SPEAKER_00]: from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: His job was to arrest people for weed and
he didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of on our team a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cop said it should be legal and
it should be more readily available for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I applaud these cops so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep watching this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is 15 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is 15 minutes from
the time they took the bong hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if this is 15 minutes from the clip
that we just saw, which would put them
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 minutes into this stoned
adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit play, turn the volume
up again, and we will see what these old
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hitting the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing a montage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 25 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting at 93, count backwards by seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're going to try to do
sobriety tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: 86.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question he just asked him is
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said starting at 93, count backwards by
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift your right foot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do that sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it for 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Count to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about five?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're doing the hold your leg up
test and the guy couldn't do five seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one guy, he did pretty good doing the
heel to toe test.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said better than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude was doing a heel to toe test a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said that he was fucking it up
because his knees were so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that he smoked a little bit of reefer,
this dude just nailed the heel to toe test
[SPEAKER_00]: because his pain doesn't hurt in his knees
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they accidentally found a good reason
to use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit play on the video again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a little floaty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not unpleasant, but it's shadowed by
the faint discomfort of not being fully
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of what police officers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very staunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very in control all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't necessarily allow you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually pretty comfortable
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's relaxed and I don't feel like
I have to be in control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this guy's enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is 45 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's claiming that marijuana is cut with
stuff, which is weird, but that's his own
[SPEAKER_03]: uneducated, you know, he doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs more to put somebody in prison
than to send them to Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're playing the game where you put
a card on your name and try to guess who's
[SPEAKER_00]: what.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to skip part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unnecessary, but you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, given in the right
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just asked, I'm going to back up two
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just asked, would you do it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's their responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm letting the YouTube video load.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told my son on the way over here,
I had a pretty good headache coming on and
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my headache started to clear up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you do it again?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, given in the right
circumstances, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll smoke again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of these guys said they will
smoke again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that was their answer,
he wants them to hit the bong one more
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing a montage of these three
older dudes taking bong hits and smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like, like they're trying to
make it a scene from the hangover or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap up this video because
I honestly don't know how much I was
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to play of that video without some
sort of usage rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give a shout out to the person that
posted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Cut Video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you subscribe to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got 587, 139 followers,
B140 for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and click like on
this video so they can get some credit
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but make sure you check it out,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a funny video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to watch it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've gotten through watching
that video, let me talk about it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I really liked is that these
dudes seemed open-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't remind me of a lot of the cops
that I've dealt with that are real
[SPEAKER_00]: standoffish and think they have to be in
control of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one cop actually said that that's a
cop's job is to be in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once he smoked a little bit of reefer,
he wanted to relax and lighten up and not
[SPEAKER_00]: be such a prick of a cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I liked that he was open-minded and
wanted to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that the one guy said it should be
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I really liked was that they
all wanted to smoke again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, yes, we would do this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe those cops are going to go talk
to one of their friends who is still a cop
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, you know what, dude,
we got stoned on this video and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: as bad as you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of their friends is going to
watch this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this video is going to help people
change their opinions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're already a fan of
cannabis, I recommend watching it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was highly entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to whoever sent that video
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember who it was, but I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few news articles that I'd like
to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article, we'll just jump right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from the Pueblo Chief
then, and it is written by Dan Cinta.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's actually written by Kristen M.
[SPEAKER_00]: White.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the headline says, extra marijuana tax
money set to hit the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked a little bit about this in
previous shows, and it is finally
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the article, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the Pueblo West Metropolitan
District will spend an additional $200,000
[SPEAKER_00]: on roads in the community for the
remainder of the year and a threefold
[SPEAKER_00]: approach that public works director Dan
Cinta outlined for the board recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extra money comes after directors
agreed to allocate the $200,000 it
[SPEAKER_00]: received from Pueblo County for marijuana
tax money toward chip sealing already
[SPEAKER_00]: planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This county will pay the $200,000 directly
to its emulsion supplier, freeing up
[SPEAKER_00]: $200,000 Pueblo West would have spent of
its $350,000 budget for chip sealing this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest need we have in the district
right now has to do with gravel roads,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinta told directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 6.2 miles of gravel roads that
when we have the storms we've had this
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, the clay underneath fails and some
stretches are impassable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be our intent to start attacking
the repair of those roads as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We propose to bring an additional staff,
equipment, and additional gravel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have recommended this several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've said that we should take
all this tax money that we're making here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Pueblo, Colorado, and fix some of the
goddamn potholes all over the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have heard us, the people have
spoken, the people listened, and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to fix the roads with all of
that tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the city of Pueblo for
actually doing something about the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they're starting with dirt
roads that are impassable, but once those
[SPEAKER_00]: are done, they're going to fix the
potholes in my city so that my car will
[SPEAKER_00]: not sound like shit when I drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually found this news article in the
Pueblo chief then, and big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow Nemopunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike sends me a lot of news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get right to this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, raising the bars for pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something else that we've been
talking about and hinting at on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and things are finally coming
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sub headline says, Denver campaign
promoting use in 21 and over 21
[SPEAKER_00]: establishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, Denver beer,
wine, or weed campaign is underway to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver voters about allowing marijuana
consumption in bars and other places that
[SPEAKER_00]: only allow people over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activists who campaign for recreational
pot legalization in Colorado have launched
[SPEAKER_00]: a petition to drive what they call limited
social marijuana consumption at bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The activists need about 5,000 signatures
to get the question on November ballots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would allow bars or clubs to allow
marijuana use as long as patrons bring
[SPEAKER_00]: their own weed and comply with clean air
laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the pot they consume would have
to be edible or if smoked, consumed on an
[SPEAKER_00]: outside patio, the way cigarette smoking
is regulated now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor smoking sites would have to be
shielded from public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys don't know about the Clean
Air Act in Colorado, you are not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke in a restaurant or anywhere that
serves food or basically where the public
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get a, I don't know the word,
tobacco shops have them, but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get like a smoking license, like a tobacco
shop or a cigarette shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to smoke in there,
they apply for a permit and you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Clean Air Act, we are not able
to smoke cannabis inside of a building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they do allow it, we're going to
have to step outside to an outdoor area
[SPEAKER_00]: that is shielded from public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just jump into the article a
little bit more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says marijuana is now, I don't like how
they worded that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read it the way it should
have been written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, marijuana as an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there are so many places to buy
dank buds in Colorado, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to legally go smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would change a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would promote business.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, I wouldn't go to a bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no reason to go to a bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anything to do with bar
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do with bar dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like drunk people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I could go to that club and hang
out and take a couple of dabs and hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: with my friends that are drinking,
I would be way more inclined to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd spend a few bucks there
because I'd have to buy a soda or some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of juice or shit to keep my mouth
hydrated while I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we'll keep going with the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado law prohibits recreational pot
consumption openly and publicly or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that endangers others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not, however, bar against
consumption in private over 21 clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver measure would clarify what
counts as a private club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we've been struggling
with here a lot in Colorado is getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: private club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana dispensaries are banned from
allowing on-site use of products they sell
[SPEAKER_00]: and from selling alcohol or food that
doesn't contain pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver proposal would only allow bring
your own consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver wouldn't be the first city to allow
marijuana in bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Colorado Springs, the state's second
largest city, has several marijuana clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are tolerated, if not specifically
allowed, by statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers has
told the city council that he plans to
[SPEAKER_00]: seek regulations on the clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gazette newspaper recently reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to three marijuana cannabis
smoking social clubs in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of cool to be able to go and
hang out and just smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the 420 Speakeasy, there's the
Lazy Lion, and then there's the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you as an adult 21 or over can go into
these places and you can have a dab of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own out of their rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring your rig or a lot of them
have a dab bar that will sell you dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them you have to pay a little fee
to get in, a little cover charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're an out of towner and you
want to come hang out and take some dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: with some Colorado kids, you know,
there's nothing wrong with going to one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually pretty damn fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up at a kind of a secretive place
in Denver, taking dabs all night at a
[SPEAKER_00]: Speakeasy up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just fun hanging out,
taking dabs in the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just replaced alcohol with dabs and
it's way fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to continue with this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver petition comes after that city
council rejected pot friendly bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver has several underground clubs where
patrons use marijuana for a joining fee,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the city has intermittently arrested
people for public consumption at those
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arresting for smoking weed again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, I thought we were past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the raids and arrests leave
tourists with nowhere to legally consume
[SPEAKER_00]: pot they've bought, argued supporters of
the ballot measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the supporters is Jane West,
an events promoter who last year arranged
[SPEAKER_00]: Classically Cannabis concert with the
Colorado Symphony Orchestra.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city threatened to block the concert,
citing public consumption laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symphony rebranded the concerts as a
private bring your own cannabis fundraiser
[SPEAKER_00]: and the city dropped its objections.
[SPEAKER_00]: West was convicted of a misdemeanor for
organizing a separate cannabis friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: event last year, a brunch at a bakery,
an eight person SWAT team descended on the
[SPEAKER_00]: event and shut down the brunch,
West said.
[SPEAKER_00]: West became one of the first to sign the
Denver petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petitions are due by early August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's this petition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody here in Colorado needs
to sign this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to this podcast,
you agree with me that we need to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational consumption in 21 and over
establishments for adults out of public
[SPEAKER_00]: view, out of indoor smoking areas,
so that we're able to medicate if we're a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical patient or we're able to recreate
if we're a recreational smoker,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be able to puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are at the bars, getting
wasted, doing shots, fucking getting
[SPEAKER_00]: drunk, getting into fights, raping each
other, being heathens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people that want to smoke a little
bit of weed and relax are being singled
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it sucks and it's time for a
revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for us to be able to smoke in
these clubs where we want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of dumb that they don't
allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Pueblo Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're in Colorado,
if you're a Colorado resident,
[SPEAKER_00]: find this petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to see if there's a link to
it, but there is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to find this petition somewhere
and we need to sign it, each and every one
[SPEAKER_00]: of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enough of that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is a little bit long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see how much time I have got left
here in this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked recently about the
discussion between the natives and the
[SPEAKER_00]: government to allow natives to grow
cannabis on native land or Indian
[SPEAKER_00]: reservations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, federal agents have rated two
major marijuana grows on tribal county or
[SPEAKER_00]: on tribal land in Modoc County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article comes from, where is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually from krctv.com,
which is a TV station in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no, let's see, Megan Hunt is
the author.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, federal agents rated what
appeared to be a large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana grow on the Pitt River XL
reservation and the Alturas reservation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Modoc County on Wednesday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photos from the scene show dozens of law
enforcement vehicles at a large greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also one photo of a bulldozer with
what appears to be a load of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in its bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Lauren Horwood of the USA,
the US attorney's office, special agents
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
Drug Enforcement Administration and other
[SPEAKER_00]: federal states and local agencies,
conducted a search of two large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana cultivation facilities located
on federally recognized tribal lands at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Alturas Indian Rancheria and the XL
Ranch.
[SPEAKER_00]: At both sites, law enforcement seized a
total of at least 12,000 marijuana plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and over 100 pounds of processed
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the contraband marijuana and
items of evidentiary value, no tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: property was seized and no federal charges
are pending, Horwood said.
[SPEAKER_00]: She explained that the search warrants are
part of an ongoing investigation relating
[SPEAKER_00]: to the financing and management of a
commercial marijuana cultivation project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The project warrant affidavits were
unsealed until today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horwood also said that while the US
attorney's office doesn't normally comment
[SPEAKER_00]: on ongoing investigations, because of the
public nature of this raid, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: She explained that marijuana grows have
received substantial attention in Modoc
[SPEAKER_00]: County, as well as the US Department of
Justice's guidance relating to marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation on tribal lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivation facility at Alturas Indian
Rancheria was located within the tribe's
[SPEAKER_00]: former event center, within approximately
100 yards of the tribe's publicly operated
[SPEAKER_00]: gaming facility, the Desert Rose Casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys were growing a major grow,
100 yards from the Desert Rose Casino,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people go all day and gamble all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of funny to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility on the XL Ranch was next to
Highway 395 on the banks of the Pitt
[SPEAKER_00]: River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horwood explained that the Pitt River
facility consisted of 40 newly constructed
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse structures, each capable of
accommodating approximately 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plants and additional gable roof
structures that boosted the square footage
[SPEAKER_00]: of roof coverage structures by another
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of plants, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This operation had 40 greenhouses with a
thousand plants each.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the potential of 40,000 plants in
those greenhouses, plus stuff that was
[SPEAKER_00]: covered that increases their square
footage by 50%, which is another 20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, if you do it mathematically,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of the grow operations, which appear
to have been operating in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and were in excess of the
locally enacted marijuana cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: limits applicable to county land,
Horwood said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I read something of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both in excess of the locally
enacted marijuana cultivation limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's kind of... If
you're allowed to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're able to do that legally without
being fucked with by the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: stay within your damn limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you just stay in the limits?
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys were over their limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing too much and that's what
got them in trouble, which is a sign of
[SPEAKER_00]: greed and selfishness and not growing from
your heart and growing from your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep going on
the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, The volume of marijuana that the
XL facility alone was capable of producing
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated approximately 40 to 60,000
plants far exceeds any prior known
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial marijuana grow operation
anywhere within the 34 county Eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: district, she added.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to tribal representatives,
all of the marijuana cultivated at both
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities was intended to be distributed
off of tribal lands at various
[SPEAKER_00]: unidentified locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the search warrant
affidavits, the investigation to date
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates both operations may have been
financed by a third party foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: national.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I actually found these
search warrants on Facebook for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was scrolling through Facebook and
somebody happened to post the search
[SPEAKER_00]: warrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason I was completely
enthralled with reading these search
[SPEAKER_00]: warrants and it was completely
entertaining for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not get my head out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they said that this third party
foreign national was a guy from Canada who
[SPEAKER_00]: owns Canadian cigarette companies who has
got a history of drug convictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got a Canadian guy come into an
Indian reservation who financed a major
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He paid for everything and they were
supposed to grow the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute this and allegedly get him his
portion and keep the operation going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed that I found the search
warrants and all of the stuff written up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys ever get a chance to read a
technical document like that, do it just
[SPEAKER_00]: for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of those kinds of people,
some people are into that shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get a kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not give the snitches names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them confidential informants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give a long excuse why they keep them
confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about how the raid happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about so many small details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will start tripping out and
wonder if you're being watched when you
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, if you read a search warrant,
because there are so many small details
[SPEAKER_00]: that these guys fucked up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting their pictures taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking to people and all of
that shit is in the police reports and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the search warrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would never assume that that
shit's being told to police, but so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the article if
I can find out where the hell I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why it goes against their
guidelines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't make any fucking tax
money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horwood said that the US attorney's office
consulted with members and representatives
[SPEAKER_00]: of both tribes, which are federally
recognized on multiple occasions before
[SPEAKER_00]: today's raid and reminded the tribes that
cultivation of marijuana is illegal under
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law and that anyone engaging in
such activity did so at the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement action.
[SPEAKER_00]: She added, they were also concerned
because the large quantities violates
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not consistent with California's
compassionate use act and undermines
[SPEAKER_00]: locally enacted marijuana regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you guys, these guys got
fucked because the tribal laws and the
[SPEAKER_00]: locals said, you guys are growing too much
weed, you're going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They went ahead and did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got dealt with by the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck around, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're allowed to grow cannabis,
if you're a native, if you're not a
[SPEAKER_00]: native, whoever you are, if you're allowed
to grow cannabis, don't throw it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: face and grow too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow the rules, grow what you're
allowed to grow and be thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a non-legal state,
do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't encourage you either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a non-legal state and you
need medicine, grow what you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the search warrant that I read you
guys, they listed all of the strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys were working with because the
way that a lot of this started,
[SPEAKER_00]: they pulled over one of their
transportation vehicles that was
[SPEAKER_00]: transporting plants from one grow facility
to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy had a thousand one gallon
pots with babies in his rider truck or his
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinsky truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they listed off what he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, they had blueberry cookies in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had platinum OG in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys had some great cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natives, the natives, the people we used
to call Indians when we were kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys are an agricultural culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of their culture is based on the earth
and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these natives that were growing these
cannabis plants were the natives that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think of when we daydream about Indians,
those guys in my mind would grow amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to have gotten a sample
of the shit that they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see what the natives are
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it's fucking dank just because
that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're outdoor people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're connected with the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're connected with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could assume that they grow some dank,
dank weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like they're putting out a lot of
it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all the news we're going to
do because we're at 29 minutes and 50
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds and my next news articles are
going to be a little lengthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might go on the next podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know how we're going to do it
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do that, I got to give a
couple of shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and also, big shout out to everybody
that's watching on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm doing most of this podcast
live on Periscope.

but if you're watching on Periscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Roxy Hula.

[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, a big, huge shout out to Judy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Judy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Hunt, Damsel,

[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's time to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything else left for you

you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 100 is going to be coming out in

[SPEAKER_00]: We're just working toward that and I'm
super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to do some celebration
or something on episode 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you join me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm just rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Cat Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everyone's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table for me today is
our good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a quick day at work, had some time to
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd have you come over and throw
down a podcast before you go do your
[SPEAKER_00]: activism stuff you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got just enough time to get an
episode in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we sure do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get it out kind of quickly,
but we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll kind of get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing some news stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to a guy
by the name of Brian Meyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's Meyer or Meyer,
but Brian, big shout out, much
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian hit that PayPal donation button and
threw a few bucks at the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll help us with some upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on getting a portable
recording device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the Zune H6 so that I can take the
show on the road a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recording gear that I have now is kind
of bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but the device I'm looking at will be
able to go to any event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to go anywhere on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep it in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have podcasts coming from all kinds
of crazy places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those donations help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work out in the very near
future, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there wants to sponsor the
podcast, just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all the information you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get your product advertised to a
target audience of about 5,000 people per
[SPEAKER_00]: week, plus all the people that go back and
listen to the cataloged episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good idea to advertise
with a cannabis-related podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's all the advertising
I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some news articles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current news Mike informed me of,
today was the day that the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Public Health and
Environment actually decided to deny PTSD
[SPEAKER_00]: as a qualifying condition for medically
recommended cannabis in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Colorado, there are eight qualifying
conditions and all eight of them were
[SPEAKER_04]: passed by the law back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the CDPHE hasn't added a single
qualifying condition in all that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the third time they've denied
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think PTSD is definitely a qualifying
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bullshit that they're not allowing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in our days working the counter,
how many people came in specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, I've got PTSD, marijuana helps so
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that you guys are here.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment basically giving
[SPEAKER_00]: their finger to veterans and telling
veterans to go drink alcohol instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming cannabis to help themselves?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically been the effect of their
policy for the last decade or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, what they were trying to do is
people that have PTSD, they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that as a qualifying condition to get
your medical marijuana recommendation from
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor here in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been denied three times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot get a post-traumatic stress
disorder as a condition that is qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be treated with medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just vets.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people out in the
community that have PTS or PTSD and
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana helps a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they can't sit down and talk to
their doctor about using cannabis directly
[SPEAKER_04]: for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd have to, if they wanted to join the
medical program, have to have one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other eight qualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least here, they can still visit the
rec market and just pay a lot more than
[SPEAKER_04]: they would in our medical.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which doesn't allow them to grow the
product that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of having your medical
marijuana card is being able to grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to assign a caregiver to grow
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to do three plants in your backyard
or if that's allowed in your area and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just brutal, difficult already.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're already suffering PTSD,
now you've got to protect yourself from
[SPEAKER_04]: all the paranoia that comes with growing
marijuana for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a large portion of the population
has some form of post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, whether it be childhood trauma,
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see something very little when
you're a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a psychology kid, a psychology
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something really little when you're a kid
can really fuck you up permanently if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't take it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a study looking at kids in some
of the rougher parts of Chicago,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was like 80% of the kids exhibited
some symptoms of PTSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have started calling it
just they've dropped the D.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no longer disorder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what the human body and brain does
after a seriously traumatic incident
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people coming home from war or
that has witnessed domestic violence or
[SPEAKER_04]: been victim to domestic violence or car
crashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen somebody die in a car crash,
and it's in the back of my mind every time
[SPEAKER_00]: we're on the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get a little flashback of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like U-turns for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've told me that amazing story there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was headed for is I was going to
imply that I don't know what event it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know there's some sort of
post-traumatic stress in my mind from my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said everybody's probably got
it because I don't have a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: event that I can recall, but I have seen
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when I feel it, even if you've
got stress of the day, when you smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: it distracts you and it calms that part of
your brain down and it allows you to not
[SPEAKER_00]: obsess on that thought and it lets you
kind of break free of that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big thing, a lot of the people that I
know that were treating their PTSD with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis would talk about is the dreamless
sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the big benefit that they'd talk
about, at least when they were in the
[SPEAKER_04]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would stop their dreams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I barely dream and I attribute that to
cannabis use because when I don't smoke,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have very vivid dreams just regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's odd because people have asked me
what I like to smoke and I say I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a heavy, heavy sativa right before
bed because it makes my mind do that
[SPEAKER_00]: wandering thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I close my eyes and I feel like I
just dream instantly because I'm already
[SPEAKER_00]: right there at that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you smoke that really high,
head high sativa and I just close my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then my dreams are claymation and they
just happen as soon as my eyes close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I sleep really well on a heavy
sativa and I have a huge dreams from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of strange that it stops
other people's dreams, which I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to argue that if it's working for them,
that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I asked you one day, like you still
dream, bro, and you looked at me like
[SPEAKER_04]: offended, like, of course, why wouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have amazing dreams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just assumed that the effect was
something you got too because you consume
[SPEAKER_04]: way more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I can control my dreams a little
bit, but if I get too carried away,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I know I'm like, eh, don't
influence this dream too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also kind of guide it a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but if I push too hard, I wake
myself up out of the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't had a dream in like eight
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dream constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up talking, oh shit, or something
like that out of a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are working on getting
medical marijuana in your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your state, please, while you're
writing the bills, while you're writing
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules, please put in some sort of a
clause that includes post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that you can see,
but it is something that definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it for our veterans more than
anything, but it's also for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be fair out there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all medical conditions are visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you got to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Write the bill well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We here in Colorado, I'll assume that the
CDPHE would be willing to add other
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions to the list of currently
accepted conditions over time,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's been countless applications at
this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember how many, but it's like
15 or 20.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: PTSD has been up three times and they've
denied everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just flat out, nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not enough research showing that
there is a general effect and there isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: research done because it's not allowed
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not enough research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to a veteran.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're in harm, you can't do the
research until very, very, like within the
[SPEAKER_04]: last few months recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these studies are being drawn up now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be conducted in the next year or
seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: The findings will be out and become public
knowledge 10 years from then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just going to keep letting
people suffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least in Colorado, they can use the rec
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like the black market ever went
away here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has had to step up its game
considerably to continue to compete,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's still decent options.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once the vet has the bud here in
Colorado, it's legal again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's no good here, but we didn't take a
step forward today and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah, we stumbled over our own
dicks once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you guys include the PTSD
when you write your new medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time it comes up that we're
trying to vote on this, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: support it because I fully think that PTSD
is a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana will be on your ballot in the
next two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not on the ballot in 2015,
vote anyway and just practice that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be ready for 2016 because it will then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a little bit in the last
episode about the desire for Denver voters
[SPEAKER_00]: to want consumption in some establishments
where people are over 21 and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: On where's the date?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it was July 9th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis posted an update to that
article and it says Denver voters favor
[SPEAKER_00]: limited pot use in bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Denver marijuana poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: A majority of voters in the city support
an initiative that would allow limited pot
[SPEAKER_00]: use no indoor smoking at businesses over
21 businesses such as bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been voted on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article was written by Ricardo Baca
from the Cannabis staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may skip part of it because we just need
to get to the point here, but it says a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of Denver voters support an
initiative that would allow limited social
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana consumption in businesses such
as bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to a poll commissioned by the
group behind the proposal, the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has learned exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of read that weird, but I think you
got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the people that wrote up the bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paid for a poll and the poll says voters
are going to support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, their poll doesn't, if you're
really into politics, their poll says that
[SPEAKER_04]: voters support it by 56% if they add in
the people that are totally not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: vote because they don't really give a
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, sure, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I would support that, but I'm not
going to go support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, but there's television on that
night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I hope it passes in 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: The need for this is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the poll data does not look favorable
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If more of us don't get politically
active.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that actually says the poll results
say only 56% of likely Denver voters
[SPEAKER_00]: either strongly support or somewhat
support the initiative according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: democratic firm, public policy polling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 56% isn't a bold number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no, that's 6% away from losing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you really look at the polling
data, it's something like 30% are like
[SPEAKER_04]: gung ho about it in 26%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here for those against the
initiative, 31% strongly oppose and 9%
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat oppose it while 5% said they
weren't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an automated telephone poll and
it's got a margin of error of 3.9
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a telephone poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on the telephone will say that they
will do anything because all they got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is sit there and press one for yes and
two for no and three for English.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all they had to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot of these people probably
won't come out and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pollsters asked whether voters
would support allowing the consumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana at private venues in Denver,
provided that the owner of the venue
[SPEAKER_00]: permits the consumption, access to the
venue is limited to individuals 21 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of age of older and smoking marijuana
indoors is prohibited and any outdoor use
[SPEAKER_00]: is hidden from public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not that, it's that of a bill
and it's fairly, sorry guys, dabs and
[SPEAKER_04]: soda.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty fair bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be outside and it's got to be
25 feet from wherever public gather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm envisioning is a shit load of
roof deck type establishments in Denver
[SPEAKER_04]: where they just, there's a couple of bars
that were already doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you felt like being outside,
you couldn't smoke up there tobacco or
[SPEAKER_04]: usually the, the last time I was up there,
but now they're going to allow marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: up there or at least 25 feet away from the
public.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like in a little back courtyard that's
all fenced off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several like Cervantes Cervantes
other side in Denver has got the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: little area for smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that other place where we go to?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of clubs up there that
have nice little outdoor areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be beautiful to smoke in which to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just let us do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that they're gathering 5,000
signatures to get the question on Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: November ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of the poll findings that
Denver residents by a four to one ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that alcohol causes more problems
in the city than marijuana and also favors
[SPEAKER_00]: their side of the contentious issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver voters have made it quite clear
that they support treating marijuana like
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol said Mason Tivert, a national pot
activist and one of the primary authors
[SPEAKER_00]: behind Colorado's original cannabis
legalizing amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says voters approved measures to,
measures to the effect in 2001 measures to
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect in 2005, 2006, 2007,
and 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not surprising that we're
still seeing such strong support even
[SPEAKER_00]: among a more conservative voting
population in an off year election.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are supporting it more
surprisingly than we had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even a poll this good is a little
surprising to people who follow this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I wish them the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I lived in Denver, they'd have my vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says in the question that asked
respondents, if alcohol or marijuana cause
[SPEAKER_00]: more problems in Denver, 55% said alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13% said marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26% said both and 6% were not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're making it obvious here that
alcohol is the problem and cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_00]: peaceful way to gather and celebrate and
have a good time and relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last paragraph of the article says,
by more than four to one margin in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: voters cite alcohol over marijuana as a
bigger source of problems in the city said
[SPEAKER_00]: Tivert, anyone who has spent time in the
Lodo on a weekend evening or walk down
[SPEAKER_00]: Colfax Avenue on any given day knows that
alcohol contributes to far more problems
[SPEAKER_00]: and far more severe problems than
marijuana, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which if you go out on almost any major
city, any big city on the weekends,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go to the bar, where is that every
downtown's got that one area where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice congregation of bars, and everybody
goes there and about one o'clock on Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: night out of one of the bars erupts a big
ass fight and half of the bar spills out
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all push the shit out of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cops come and a few people
get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hear about it Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen at weed events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, we shun those people from
the community and they don't come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a peaceful drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like alcohol is the problem for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if they let us smoke at clubs
and stuff, I would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to places because I don't drink
alcohol and there's no reason for me to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can go take a few dabs,
I'd be more likely to go to the shows at
[SPEAKER_00]: the local venues because even though it's
not my kind of music, I would go be social
[SPEAKER_00]: if I could go dab out and have fun there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not anti-social.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just sick of explaining that we
don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want a beer, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's not because I'm better than
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I don't want to be an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drunken asshole when I drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want the hangover anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the hangover is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a hangover in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time to vote,
you guys, I want everybody that listens to
[SPEAKER_00]: this show that lives in the 303 and the
720, I want you guys all to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You looked at me like I was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you have to go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do legalize consumption in adult places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're staring at the dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just noticed the turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since you're looking at the turpex
container, I've got a star this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says dab review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I went up to Colorado
Springs and I visited my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visited the lovely damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also visited my good buddy hunt and I
saw Jordan and I saw the terpy boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also saw John Randall's Jr. And we
all had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took Danielle with me and we went up
to the shop and I picked up some turpex
[SPEAKER_00]: sour Durbin sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to say, bro, it is sativa as a
mofo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get super dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke this shit, you're looking at
me like, well, let's get a dab of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herein lies the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only lasted a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasted one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approved of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys can get your hands on the
sour Durbin at Green and Healthy Wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado Springs from turpex,
I would definitely recommend that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turpex is doing some amazing things down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the turpex crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me, they hooked me up with a
white and a black x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra large turpex t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am now styled out in turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm repping it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get a dab for myself and then I'll
get a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you like these little tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got stuff to do tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a dab for Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while Mike takes that dab,
I'm going to move ourselves into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: article here and we will read some news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill my Mike while I choke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's your buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you hear all that echo that cuts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are reaching, how much time are we
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 20 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make this a little bit of a
longer episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says, this is also from The
Cannabis and it was written by Jean
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson of the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, one year in, $70 million
in pot taxes and other lessons from
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sub headline, we get a headline and a
sub headline now in articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet is fucking up our heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: With $250 million in marijuana sales,
Washington still has room to grow as its
[SPEAKER_00]: ninth largest grower says, it's amazing we
could be so successful and unsuccessful at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, Washington
launched its second in the nation legal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana market with just a handful of
stores selling high-priced pot to long
[SPEAKER_00]: lines of customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year later, the state has about 160
shops open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot tax revenues have soared past
expectations and sales top $1.4 million
[SPEAKER_00]: per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making $1.4 million per day on
cannabis in Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes on to say, and who knows,
the industry might even start making some
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington pot farmers, processors,
and retailers have complained all year
[SPEAKER_00]: that heavy state and federal tax burdens
along with competition from an unregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana market have made it
difficult for them to do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least some relief is there as here
this month, two new laws take effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: one to regulate and tax medical marijuana
and one to cut Washington's three-level
[SPEAKER_00]: excise pot tax to a single 37% tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's higher than Colorado tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the big lesson between
Washington and Colorado is that the free
[SPEAKER_04]: market applies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of people that have been
smoking marijuana here for 40,
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 years, and the only time they visit the
stores is for novelty or the occasional
[SPEAKER_04]: selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, they're still buying
marijuana where they used to because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: half the price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Washington, the taxes are so bad that
almost none of the locals are interested
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're taxing it like 75% or it's
like 25% three different times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by the time it gets to the
consumer, it grams like 60 bucks and what
[SPEAKER_04]: the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to pay that when you can just
go to the dude on the corner and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: for 12 or 15?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article goes on to say,
despite some industry gripes and those
[SPEAKER_00]: tweaks to Washington's legal pot law,
marijuana law, which voters passed in 2012
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize marijuana for adults over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials and legalization backers say the
state's slow and deliberate effort to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate marijuana has been a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year after stores opened on July 8th,
2014, here's a look at the state of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: weed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington racked up more than $250
million in marijuana sales in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: year, roughly $62 million of weight which
constitute marijuana excise taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beyond the state's original
forecast of 36 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the state and local sales and
other shops, other taxes are included,
[SPEAKER_00]: the total payday for the state and local
government tops $70 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the interesting number there is the 60
million excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Colorado, the excise tax is what's
supposed to pay that $40 million for
[SPEAKER_04]: schools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've already crushed in the first
five months of this year, last year's
[SPEAKER_04]: whole year total because the standalone
production market's only just now coming
[SPEAKER_04]: online.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the shops had to produce their own for
the longest time here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was the infrastructure we
started with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, that excise tax was
real small here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the huge difference between our
taxes and their taxes is by the time it
[SPEAKER_04]: gets to the shelf, that excise tax is
nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only 10 million of theirs was in sales
tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: We collected like 60, 40 or something like
that in just sales tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope when the nationwide legalization
happens, I hope all these crazy taxes are
[SPEAKER_00]: done away with or adjusted somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have to come back down to
reality or they won't matter so much
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're charging you 36% tax on a
$2 a gram, which is entirely feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing a lot of cannabis right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Washington, they may grow more than
they're able to sell is something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: see possibly happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could go really dirty cheap pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how long we've been
recording and we might, yeah, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to read the rest of this article and then
we're going to save the, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one more article we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next sub headline in this article
says, isn't legal weed expensive in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes on to say a few growers
harvesting by the first time, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me read it again because it's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The few growers harvesting by the time the
first stores opened, the average price of
[SPEAKER_00]: a gram of legal marijuana spiked to nearly
$30 last summer, about three times the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost in medical marijuana shops,
where prices have been dropping as more
[SPEAKER_00]: weed gets harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Washington has harvested 13.5
tons of marijuana flower intended to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sold as bud, but stores have only sold
about 10 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the excess can be turned into
marijuana extracts such as oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the harvest has helped drive down the
prices to an average of about $11.50 per
[SPEAKER_00]: gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little bit right about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew too much and it's getting
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, that in addition to tourists
eager to visit the city's historic first
[SPEAKER_00]: legal pot shop, his clientele primarily
consists of customers in the 25 and older
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of an adult demographic,
but that's okay, he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have jobs and they can afford to buy
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next headline says, so what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Garza, director of Washington's
Liquor Control Board, soon to be renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: the Liquor and Cannabis Board says he's
proud of Washington's efforts at meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: the top priorities the Justice Department
laid out when it announced it would allow
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Colorado and other states to
regulate marijuana, keeping criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations out of the industry,
keeping the marijuana in-state and keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: pot away from the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, the state adopted
background checks and financial
[SPEAKER_00]: investigations of pot license applicants
and capped the total amount of production
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to keep it in line with in-state
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: While public health advocates say they
wish the state had done more to stress the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential harms of pot to teens,
the state required strict packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling requirements to keep children
from getting into the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of set a little standard here,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products that appeal to kids also
remain banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: No marijuana, cotton candy or gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Claude, you can't get the sweet stone
bears up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything here is sold in the childproof
packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even the candy bars come in a pill
bottle, essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like they look like what your
kids eat or it can be confused easily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're well labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article wraps up to say,
this isn't the first time people have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: to Oregon to buy something either because
it's cheaper or because they don't apply
[SPEAKER_00]: sales tax, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it for liquor and we see it for
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're making an a ton of money in
Washington and they may have grown too
[SPEAKER_00]: much cannabis, which is fine because
they're pushing down the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do this one more article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also from Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know guys, I'm in Colorado, but I like
to share the news from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says Washington cracking down on
unlicensed medical marijuana stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even have to read the whole
article here because that headline says it
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by Martha Belial from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I said your last name right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said 15 unlicensed medical marijuana
shops in unincorporated King County are on
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that they are violating the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg and
Sheriff John Something said Wednesday that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're cracking down on these stores
after Washington lawmakers amended
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative 502 to require licenses for all
pot shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The change in the law brought medical
marijuana into the state licensing and tax
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme, Satterberg said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stores were notified by mail this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they continue to operate as
unlicensed retail outlets for the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market, they'll face civil and criminal
ramifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these shops are not registered and
they're operating like medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the 15 stores that received the
notice include seven in the White Center
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, two in Skyway and six in the
Eastern part of the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Messages left at Northwest Cannabis Market
in Seattle and Military Road Holistic in
[SPEAKER_00]: Auburn were not immediately returned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no answer at Pacific Coast
Natural Medicine in Seattle or the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution rent in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these people are not answering the
phones because they're scared shitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get raided probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking tax money from the state
and operating in locations that would
[SPEAKER_00]: never be approved by the LCB, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are blight on the neighborhoods they
inhibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a matter of opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said the federal government is watching
how Washington regulates the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and the success of the law
depends on how well local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with unlicensed retail stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to sending notifications to
the 15 stores, county officials have
[SPEAKER_00]: notified landlords that there is an
illegal business operating on the
[SPEAKER_00]: property, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that if the stores continue to
operate illegally, the liquor and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: board can go in and seize all of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the civil options don't work,
they will consider criminal remedies,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going in heavy handed on this,
he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're telling them the new scheme has to
be followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The days of the wild, wild west are over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw this kind of happen in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally still happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happened in our city like three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was just some dude who was like,
yeah, I could do this and just opened up a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary essentially out of his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that guy's been going on for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy also was accused of blasting
buds, making BHO out of the buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling those buds that he blasted back on
the black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he stood out with his sore thumb and
got turned in by people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: neighborhood or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these guys have storefronts with
advertising and they're advertising just
[SPEAKER_00]: like a normal store and now they're going
to either have to get raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they don't bring it to that because
this is what sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a state that allows you to do
this and then people like this don't
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the rules and they fuck it up for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to have to go in there
and tell them to shut this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't, they're going to get
raided, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds will come in and take all of
their shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at this point in Colorado,
you just Googled the rules and then follow
[SPEAKER_04]: the path laid out and you can have your
marijuana store.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just follow the rules and do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can just put a sign in your front
yard and get yourself a white board and a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of jars and a cash register and go
to town out of your living room and wait
[SPEAKER_04]: for the cops to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will show up and you'll be
charged with unlawful distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be charged with possession of
marijuana.
All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a crime to do all that unless
you're a dispensary owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we've been going 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough news for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, thanks for coming over,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to wrap it up pretty quickly
because Mike's got somewhere to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have on the list here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of questions from
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to save those for another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to remind you guys,
naturesgreenremedies.com has changed their
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: naturesgreenremedies.com has a new
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out thedankteam.com,
thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a coupon code for you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still rebuilding the website,
getting everything going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out thedankteam
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Yankee?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this one,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everything's going well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you guys follow me on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I have been on Periscope quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My account is just rostagef on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the news you guys have been hearing,
not all of it, but a good portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: news that I've been bringing to you guys
has been getting tweeted to me from Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike, thanks for sending me all the
news, giving us content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing two shows a week because
you've got so much news content for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to keep the people informed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like prohibition was, it was just
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like no one questioned it when we were
kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that dam is breaking and if more
people start getting active and more
[SPEAKER_04]: people are informed, we're going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so fucking close.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're almost, the 50-50 line is
almost crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are almost more legal states than
illegal states now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is when that crosses, I think that's
when something will happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We broke the population 50-50 line
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the numerical state number now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a hundred East Coast states
with like eight people in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they're the size of Denver.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I want to not
forget to give shout outs to Mark Dank,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reve and Arnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, happy birthday to my cousin Brandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you listen to this show,
but Brandy, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes out on July 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is her birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are smoking a bowl,
if you're taking a dab, blow one up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air for my cousin Brandy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's one of my best friends growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like my little sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy birthday, girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm going to talk about one more
thing and then we're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there's a guy on Instagram who calls
himself Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude sent me this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had it set up for a day now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a lot of time to play with
it, but the time I have had to play with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I really fucking enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude makes custom coffee tables,
end tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes bookcases.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes shelves, but he installs an
e-nail in your table for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have now got a coffee table with two
e-nail coils coming out of the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two rigs sitting on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those nails are hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can walk over there and Mike and I can
take a dab side by side and choke
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I took a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two friends that are a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're together and they came over and I
told them, go take a dab together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they got to go do a couple dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he painted the iReGenetics Colorado
logo on the tabletop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a three foot long by, I think that's
about two feet wide coffee table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little shelf on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's super sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The e-nails work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot complain about those e-nails at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spectacular, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked in and was like, bro,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_04]: He just smiled big.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to demo it a little
bit and really, really give it a try.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do a real review.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point, I can say it looks just
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far it has worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken several dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing out of it since
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: He watched me unbox it on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually was on, I did a Periscope
video when it got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unboxed it and set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bobo got to watch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, big shout out to Bobo Blaster
Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check him out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making furniture with an e-nail built
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what that is,
you just got to go check out either his
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or his website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's burniture, like the word furniture
with a B, burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big cartel is just like a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an Etsy or eBay or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a retail sales site where
anybody can set up their own store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out burniture
.bigcartel.com, support my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I endorse this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to play hard with it and see if
I can't break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do everything we normally do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll give them a full review
here in a couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you check them out because
so far I think it's a bad-ass product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks gorgeous, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that logo across the top is really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't deserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked on the website to see what he
sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: these tables for, and I am completely
grateful and appreciative of the gift you
[SPEAKER_00]: have sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, it's time to start
wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some notes here that I like to
read toward the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should come out on July 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I will be back on Monday with a
