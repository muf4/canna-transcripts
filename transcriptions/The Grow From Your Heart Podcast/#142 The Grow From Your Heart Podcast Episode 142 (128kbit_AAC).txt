[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 142 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to give a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got through it without coughing,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I deserve an award.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to go fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is the 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to come out on Sunday,
710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 710, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got the e-mail turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got the dabber going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a quartz banger heated up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got that highly educated titanium
quartz combo going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got a an Elevate rig with a fat
nail on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're smoking some super good
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're a spoiled bitch like I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're over there smoking some of
those fresh OG Kush turps from our friends
[SPEAKER_01]: at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, on the show with me
today, celebrating 710, is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I am DTFO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little pre-game over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got the cough going a little bit,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the throat thing where you got to
act like you're not going to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep convincing yourself,
I'm not going to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're taking dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me, tell me what you're dabbing at
GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you're taking dabs of
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it live resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it poop soup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it tain batter?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it some of those Evo Labs fresh turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some of these fresh
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not a lot of people in the world
know what the hell I'm even talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got fancier, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have stepped up our game here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said we, like I'm involved in this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my role in this party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Involved consumer level only.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a little product research for these
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be your space monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take some shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're taking CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 90% sure that this is made with CO2
oil, a CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people right now in
the industry playing with refining CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 oil in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this seems to be my favorite way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fractal distillation process.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first home run I've gotten to
play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the clear, they're calling it
distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the distillate is done with a
fractal distillation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're separating basically
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoids, the turpinoids and the
lipids are all pulled apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this container right here is a
container of nothing but the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 90%, 90.94% THC and 1.1% CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is raw distillate from Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna open the jar here and try to
describe what's in this container the best
[SPEAKER_01]: I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like really runny honey or super
clear olive oil maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got more of the consistency of
like honey or maple syrup a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little thicker than any olive oil
I've ever seen, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color might be right though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just looks like, I don't know,
it's like honey almost in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this doesn't have much flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just raw distillate THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just super potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super stupid potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a little bit of this on the dabber
and this is where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that little bit that's on the
dabber and I dunk that into the Ghost
[SPEAKER_01]: Train Haze Raw Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mostly turpinoids with a little
bit of cannabinoids, like 1% or 2% THC in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I a dick if I call it the adult version
of Fun Dips?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely, well, I'm a deadhead
and we've got our own little version of
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun Dips, but this is the weed world of a
Fun Dip.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take that beautiful 90% THC
distillate and then you dunk it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dunk it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the glorious part is, in my other
hand, I've got some OG Kush Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can either dunk it in my OG Kush
Terps or I can dunk it over here in my
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghost Train Haze Terps or I could dunk it
in one and then I could dunk it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're changing up the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG Kush Terps, if you put it on this
distillate and dab it, it tastes like you,
[SPEAKER_01]: if apples tasted like OG Kush and you bit
into an OG Kush apple, it was just OG Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: all in my mouth and you could almost chew
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much OG Kush flavor these Terps
put in your face.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor content's really, really nice
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the high from the distillate
comboed with, I really like the high that
[SPEAKER_01]: I get from the Ghost Train Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sativa dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about this every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other stuff that's in it, the THC is
definitely a big part of the high,
[SPEAKER_02]: but everything else that's in it really
plays with that THC in some fun ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost never go for the most potent on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about the rest of your
life, you typically don't do that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to get that other component to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this way you can get both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get insanely potent and really,
really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of being a snobby bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take some of this blue Sherb 120 micron
fresh frozen solventless hash and I roll
[SPEAKER_01]: out a little patty and then I dunk some
Durban poison shatter onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I rubbed a little Cactus Cooler
Live Resin on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put a little bit of the Terps
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put some of that 90% THC
distillate on top of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a big ass dab of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember in high school when you used to
go park somewhere and see how high you
[SPEAKER_01]: could get, I don't think we got that high
as when I took that big ass dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: My arm hair was wiggling around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was visibly waving like a flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing something similar with
just much, much cheaper products.
[SPEAKER_02]: With just your typical wax or shatter,
I'll take a piece of shatter and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pancake it out real far, throw a little
wax in the middle, roll up a little
[SPEAKER_02]: taquito and dab that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mine are much smaller and much less
fancy than the ones you've been throwing
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to go big or go home when I take
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go little and go often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go big and go often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best of both worlds I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the best parts about taking
dabs is that you can grab the dabber and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike can take his dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's a cigarette smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get Mike worked up a little
bit, you can hear him gurgle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't even need dabs to start making
funky lung butter noises.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sounds like the bong occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give Mike, if you handed me the dabs
that I gave Mike, I would laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, can you maybe triple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quadruple that up and Mike takes just
little pin sides dabs, probably the dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: you take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike takes that size of a dab and he will
cough and turn purple and get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the E-nail carb cap set up as smooth
as it is over here, I cough like a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not nearly as bad as home because I
don't have that carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cap adds quite a bit, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's educate folks on the E-nail right
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electronic continuously heated nail is
a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a little dangerous depending on
where you dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one in the car for several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The space I dab often is also shared by
three large dogs that are really furry and
[SPEAKER_02]: fluffy and psychotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was going to add an E-nail to that
mix, something would get set on fire that
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a dog would get burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have a bald spot somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason I don't have one yet,
but it's on the short list of things to
[SPEAKER_02]: treat myself to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take mine out of the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting careless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting too high in the car,
which I was like, I'm pretty, pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: medicated here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to chill out on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I had to set the rig in the
cup holder and I forgot it was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt warmth a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I was going to burn
myself, but I was like, Ooh, that is warm
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, I'm kind of close to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took the E-nail out of the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you what to do, but if
there's somebody in the back, that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to have their medical cannabis available
while you're driving, they can consume
[SPEAKER_01]: their medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an adult, but so the E-nail,
there's a box on my table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a six inches long, four inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smaller than the original Nintendo,
but a little taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a display on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little led display with a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a power switch on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the coolest fucking features.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a USB port.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is charging his phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much every episode that I've been
on in the last six months, my phone's been
[SPEAKER_02]: charging on that USB slot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a really beautiful feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friend Giddy up at
Emotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: This E-nail was actually a gift from Giddy
up at Emotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out and shout out to
Margulies for the replacement coils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so there's this box with an led screen
on the front with numbers displayed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coming out of that box is another
cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a silver cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a silver braided cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes to where the dab nail is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're using any sort of nail setup,
instead of the little nail that sits
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the rig in the dome or a titanium
domeless, we've got a much larger titanium
[SPEAKER_02]: domeless that has this coil leading to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's tightly wrapped around the
nail so that it can evenly heat that
[SPEAKER_02]: surface to whatever temperature we feel
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I want to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody talks about what temperature
is your E-nail set to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe that that number right
there where it says 717 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not at all a temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's a temperature I don't
think it correlates to the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature on my nail surface because I
think this box would cost much more money
[SPEAKER_01]: for it to actually have a thermostat
inside it that's doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our friends that is a the guy that
works on my website actually told me
[SPEAKER_01]: that's actually a frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've always understood it to
be is just the random frequency that it
[SPEAKER_02]: kicks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus it gives you something to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like your speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 doesn't fucking mean anything.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it means something to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that in my car 23 is like the prime
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go up to 26, it gets a little,
you don't want to hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry starts sounding a little extra
heroin-y if you turn them up too loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've posted pictures before us getting
ready to record stuff and somebody always
[SPEAKER_02]: chimes in and is like, dude, your E-nail
is like 300 degrees too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's not a temperature is
always like the first three replies that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have to put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if you bought seven EmoTech
units, they'd all be closed to the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a couple that have the
temperature display and I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one Task Rock made, the original and
we're going to talk about Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is the fucking seven 10
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You best believe we're going to talk about
our boy Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original E-nail, that Task Rock of
highly educated, the innovator,
[SPEAKER_01]: the originator, that original E-nail did,
I think that temperature did correlate to
[SPEAKER_01]: the one on the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm not certain, but I'm pretty
sure it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Big D with the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the museum version.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the first E-nail that Task made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on Daniel's shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love and respect to Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope to see you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really don't think that that number
correlates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like Mike said, that's definitely
not a temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get in your car or whatever,
where you like it, where you really like
[SPEAKER_01]: to jam out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your favorite song comes on,
when born to be wild comes on and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive on the freeway way too fast,
whatever, like 23, 39, whatever it is on
[SPEAKER_01]: your car stereo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not 23 decibels.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a random number they picked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had something for you to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medium high right before it starts
crackling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think my dad's kind of hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the E-nail a little hotter than
most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Spence would come over, shout out to
Spencer from the Garden of Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would immediately turn it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wouldn't even ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be like, you don't nail too hot,
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't say dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would call me the N word.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're nailed too hot, N word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reach over and just turn my shit down
like it was his.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't argue, because that's
Spencer and he made the hash for about to
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he would always turn it the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be like, my esophagus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always has a burning out esophagus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he turned that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take pretty low tab dabs at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every now and then I undershoot it or like
I sneeze between heating the nail with the
[SPEAKER_02]: torch and going to dab and then find it's
a little too cold and I puddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like you have to overheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even overheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hot enough to cook all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I'm sucking like four dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, bro, we used to go way
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until that skillet glows like the sun,
you keep heating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the Grateful, the remaining members
of the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil Lesh doesn't tour anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they call themselves Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Dead and Co in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friend that took me to
that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I saw the Dead in Boulder and fucking,
there were some kids taking dabs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back of this SUV.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the tailgate up and they had the
dab rig sitting up on a little thing so
[SPEAKER_01]: that all they had to do was put it to
their face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dude heats it with the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just walking toward this car,
walking through rows, walking through the
[SPEAKER_01]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see him just and I was like,
it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to turn that nail into
fucking water right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't say anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was none of my business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, he's going to put the dome
on or whatever and let it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw the dome on and fucking put that
dabber to that nail while it was glowing
[SPEAKER_01]: bright orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just cringed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not my place to say anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my heart just tingled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, God, that poor fucking
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are you ruining yourself for no
reason, you're also losing so much of the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're burning up the turps, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're burning the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: The downside is if you undershoot it,
you end up just wasting your hash on the
[SPEAKER_02]: nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puddles instead of vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I hit the e-nail, when I'm taking a
big fat dab, a lot of times, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: I come home from work and I want to dab
like a half gram, maybe a gram of hash in
[SPEAKER_01]: one fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more people in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll raise their hands and fucking
testify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff will pull a gram of dab,
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got hands up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do that on the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times when I'm smoking these
turps and the distillate, I bust out this
[SPEAKER_01]: one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Elevate Cline Cycler with the little
banger on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got a, they say it's Quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you money that's fucking glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little glass banger on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my flavor saver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it tastes a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Quartz versus Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes I got to say that the
Quartz tastes a little bit better in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that on my short list of things I
want to treat myself with is a nice Quartz
[SPEAKER_02]: banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really dig this one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a highly educated titanium base
with a Quartz dish on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some of that on Instagram and didn't
let myself look because I was doing car
[SPEAKER_02]: repairs at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a guy like myself that likes to travel
with a little rig like that, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this banger, the way that I travel
with it, that would get destroyed quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where my DAB rig sits most of the
time, that would be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't risk the e-nail right now,
but I could risk the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: The puppy could take the bucket,
but not the e-nail?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cord that's the problem on the
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: In practice, I know my household well
enough to know that that rig would get
[SPEAKER_01]: yanked off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cord is dangerous at this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cord is knocked over and broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: This exact rig once before just sitting
there, it just wobbled and spun itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cord on this e-nail was coiled in a
box for a hundred years, it looks like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and shipped from fucking China,
and vacuum packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be coily shaped for the rest
of its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you try to straighten it out and
it makes you think it went straight,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it just starts coiling slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll wind itself back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll wind itself up and tip your rig
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn your e-nail off when you leave the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reminder to myself also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea how many times I've come
home and been like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never leave the house with an active heat
source running like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of basic human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low temp is better when I'm doing a small
dab is what I wanted to kind of take that
[SPEAKER_01]: e-nail versus the quartz, the titanium
versus quartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the nice thing about the quartz is
you can bring that temp down even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let it cool, get it glowy hot and let
it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that, or do be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jason Margulies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so many friends that'll heat the
nail until it's glowing orange and bust
[SPEAKER_01]: out a fucking timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have timed exactly like from when it
glows right here, bro, you hit go and wait
[SPEAKER_01]: this many seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect fucking dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always like, no, you waited too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have gone seven seconds sooner
than that because it's too cool for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it a little warm, but if I'm trying
to dab these terps, I'll oftentimes go for
[SPEAKER_01]: the quartz and go low temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low temp, we say you got to taste it to
waste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit it low temp, carb cap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get all that flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a little tiny dab and then grab a
Q-tip and heat the nail just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: and clean it out with the Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you got a fresh banger again.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call that the Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heat the fuck out of it until it glows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I throw another dab in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I roll with the banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not on the Q-tip tech and the low temp
tech, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like take a fat dab and get it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Adam Hill would say red means go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He eats the fuck out of it and just throws
a mad dab in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much on my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low temp is better for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low temp is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, when you're trying to set the
temperature to your email, everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what temperature do I set it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got something to jump in with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right setup is really key to getting
the most out of your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take a really nice low temp dab on
an email and with the carb cap,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't waste anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you go really low, it's still
going to continuously heat that surface
[SPEAKER_02]: and vaporize everything off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got it carb capped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it takes a second to get it done,
you're not going to lose anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually enjoy all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where it takes
the time and investing in the right tools
[SPEAKER_02]: to really get the best bang out of your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the reason I end up so
baked here is because I've only got like
[SPEAKER_02]: half the pieces at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I low temp it, I end up losing a good
bit off the top of my nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm taking small dabs anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that the first dab, every time I
come over here, I cough way harder than I
[SPEAKER_02]: have in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I get a little bit higher than I've
been in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that I think is because I use a
smaller rig than most folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My rig's a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like, I prefer a smaller rig and
I prefer an e-nail on a small rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm hitting the Hitman Sidecar,
the E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole rig- It's small to the point
and it heats to the point where he's got
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep an eye on the water level because
it will cook itself dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mad Rob is like fucking four inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love these little rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll cook itself raw during a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that happen before and you
caught it before you hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sloppy taking a dry dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Elevate Klein, it's taller,
but it's still got a very minimal amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of air space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a lot of space from the time
that I put my dab on the surface of this
[SPEAKER_01]: dab nail for it to go down here,
down this tube, into the water and into my
[SPEAKER_01]: face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want as little resistance as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to get that dab into my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like all the percolators and all
the extra bubbles and shit, that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: stealing your dabs, stealing your turps,
stealing your flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want all that extra bubble-age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want enough water just to cool it down
from hitting that nail and then let me get
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually took dabs today through this
little rig without enough water in it and
[SPEAKER_01]: I got ultra high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got stupid high because it didn't have
enough water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of burny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my throat tingle a little bit,
but holy shit, I was red-eyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I used a really good
portable hash pen, they never last for
[SPEAKER_02]: very long, but the first time I used one,
they gave you that first dozen hits well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn the fuck out of my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little cloud pins.
[SPEAKER_02]: The no percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes like hot plastic?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was a different company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still tasted like hot plastic because the
mouthpiece was plastic, but fuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, that burn lasted all week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the throat burn for a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember when you stay at a bong,
you'd fill it and you'd get it full and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd keep sucking and that chamber would
fill and you'd keep sucking and all your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends would be like, pull it,
pull it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd look at them like, nope,
I'm going to get high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a big ass bong hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pull it and then all that
smoke goes in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point of a big pipe or a big
bong or a big rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that fucker up and then carb it and
get smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice a dab rig, there's no carb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want that fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw the carb cap on to trap the heat
in the nail and put a little vacuum in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a little tiny hole in the carb
cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get less air flowing through that heat
stays in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every bit of air that comes through moves
that oil around on the top of the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes into your brain and then you
get stupid high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel the need to suck like a liter
of oxygen through my bong before I start
[SPEAKER_01]: getting my dab to my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of dab bongs and I know a
lot of people that are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell an amazing nail that is,
it's a beautiful six in one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: designed for rigs or bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll fit anything on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a copy of the highly educated
Infiniti nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful, beautiful invention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It completely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I see it and I've got extra
money in my pocket, I'm like, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I remember that I don't like dab
bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just way too much volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it on the inside of the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, that's hash that's supposed
to be in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the side of the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as you cough and choke anyway,
you don't need to spend that extra energy
[SPEAKER_01]: on your lungs pulling a liter of air up
through your fucking tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a bong for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my primary smoking device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaned my bong yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picked up flour today and yesterday
because that's mainly what I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a nice dab, you got to go with a
smaller rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you started talking about flour,
maybe you want to segue into something
[SPEAKER_01]: else that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer indica flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was going to go shopping,
like right here on the table, I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: some blue sherb that I grew at the Greener
Healthy Wellness Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smell so yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here in this container, I got some
Jeff's OG that I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both heavy indica dominant
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just has that funk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This so far is my proudest grow in this
garden, but wait until you see the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer these indica dominant flowers
that sit you down, chill you out,
[SPEAKER_01]: cushy, piney, dank flavored flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to roll a joint with that and
I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to taste earthy and funky
and coffee-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when it comes to my dabs,
if you notice all my dab selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything over here is like candy
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, this one doesn't even have a
label anymore, whatever that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some of the blue sherb,
of course, the solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Super Lemon Haze over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is Cold Creek Kush because I
obviously like those Kush terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going super heavy citrus lately
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only exception is the Durban,
which is all pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was building up to the Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing like Lemon G terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor of Lemon G live resin in my
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can only dab, I don't know that Lemon
G would be my one and only, but if I had
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick three strains that I had to dab
for the rest of my life, Lemon G would be
[SPEAKER_01]: in that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to replace it with Lemon
Jeffrey though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to set them side by side,
take dabs and pick about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going sweet for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a few weeks for a while and I
just went all sweet the last six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That heavy diesel flavor I've loved since
nearly 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that in your dabs or your flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour diesel live resin is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a little at home right now that I
can treat myself with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't enjoy sour diesel concentrates at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember one time I ended up with some
sour diesel concentrates on accident and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I ended up in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up in my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't care for that flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used it as treats for when I did shit
around the house that I didn't want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, but some tangy or some
jelly bean dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, I'm a junkie bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some strawberry banana live resin
at home that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry banana tangy, the SBT,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody seems to be going goo goo over
the strawberry banana tangy stuff from
[SPEAKER_01]: Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Crockett for making killer
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how being a breeder and
somebody that works in a large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facility, seeing the
difference in buds that are grown and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are grown for flower
production and plants that are grown
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically for oil production,
we've got a cut that we gave it to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody in another state and they grew
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they grew it out and saw it,
they're like, fuck this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut down all of the remaining plants
of it and they sent the flowers to an
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That extraction lab was like, what the
fuck did you send us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cuts that we got from our friends in
Colorado, that would be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, what the fuck is this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The extraction lab ran it and they called
the guy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, bro, you got to come over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude went over there and he took a dab
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, this is the best fucking hash
I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best hash anyone in this
fucking building has ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more?
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a sad face because he cut down all
of the fucking plants that he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant doesn't fit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having this conversation today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in the future here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We forget it so often here for the rest of
the country and for sure the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to legal cannabis products
or cannabis products period, we have stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I mean, if you guys went legal
yesterday, you wouldn't see for five
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes that kind of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fucking strain will not finish for
anything and it's ugly, but it makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: best oil, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to start seeing different
types of plants grown for different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing specific shit at the grow
right now that will only be made into oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got strains that I will never let
anybody see that flower because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: ugly as shit, but the oil that comes out
of it is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be fucking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while now, the hash has been stalled
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wax and shatter and butter and
butters just basically wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of stumbled over if I'm not
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm wrong for butter lovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then live resin came along and people
really started thinking about where can we
[SPEAKER_02]: go next with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that people started playing
with CO2 oil because there's a huge demand
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're left with this goo and a
syringe that's impossible to consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I used to hate CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, I hate that goopy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't taste right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that they've cleaned it up,
the taste is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's further refined like this or
separated completely and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: reconstitute it back on with your desk,
like do it yourself style, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a lot of fun mixing up the little
cocktails for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been just taking this shatter and
dunking it straight into the turps all
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long, expensive process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't even want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the equipment alone, you could buy a
house just for a couple of nice ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this isn't the only variety I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a local outfit that's been
bringing samples by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their first two samples were epic
fails, like unmarketable, unsellable,
[SPEAKER_02]: not unsmokable, way better than shit
you're going to get in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the name of the company have a family
member in the name of the company?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was just not at all a good
concentrate ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing about it was solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But attempts three and four were really,
really nice final products that are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably going to be really popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm seeing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's products that we get people asking
by name and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I don't have people asking for
the Leafs by Snoop, but I do have people
[SPEAKER_02]: asking for new styles of hash that come
out every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we send material out to, Turpex does
all the extractions for us from the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpex does all the extractions from the
green and healthy wellness garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we send out materials,
we send them a lot of fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: material, but we send them a lot of dry
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fresh frozen we can request.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously going to be live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't even dab in your coffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hit me a rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the hash over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, dude, that looks nice and just got a
random cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send fresh frozen material out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chop down a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cut it into small buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We throw those buds into freezer bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those freezer bags go directly into the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get frozen immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we run to the store and get bags of
ice and put those bags of ice into a giant
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that frozen material into that cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive that to a location where it is then
turned into live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, we can have it turned into
live sap, live sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can almost get a live shatter from some
of the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sour diesel won't live shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just too oily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you build a relationship with the
extraction company you're working with,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have two specific extractors that we
talk to a lot that work with Terpax,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can tell them what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, that strain's not going to
do that, or that strain is going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we can get triangle killer
sugar and Rude Boy sap on consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rude Boy live resin sugar is one of my
favorite fucking things to dab ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is right where I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things get you on the top of the
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things get you in the back of the
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you feel on the shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Rude Boy hits me right in the eyes
and in the forehead, and it makes me dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes math skills go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes me goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I like pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want cookies after I smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is the 710 episode, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about 710 for a whole
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should talk about the origin of 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, do you have any idea where the
number 710 came from, why 710 is part of
[SPEAKER_01]: this culture, part of this community?
[SPEAKER_02]: You flip it upside down and it spills out
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because a lot of the people that
started this movement were of the age
[SPEAKER_02]: where they had beepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about as far as I've bothered
to follow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Adam Ill coined the phrase,
710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, it was all about 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get together at 420 and smoke some
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get together at 710, take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you turn 710 upside down, it does say
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the best of my knowledge, Task Rock is
the person that created the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Task Rock and I and a couple other
guys were either in a chat or on a
[SPEAKER_01]: conference call and they were talking
about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, we need something a little
more bougie than 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's upgrade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it with the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was at the same time that hash kids
were separating from flower kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: By kids, I mean full grown adults,
but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hustler kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where 710 came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: 710 was coined, as far as I know,
to the best of my knowledge and I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of research, but Task Rock
and a couple other cats are the guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: coined the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: They created 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task Rock, of course, he's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task Rock has a couple of albums out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite songs is probably First
Place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Do It Again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Boil That Oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also does Hits From The Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of hash related music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash related music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to listen to some task and take
some dabs or get dabbed out and drive
[SPEAKER_01]: around and listen to some task weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically, I would like to get dabbed
out and drive around as a passenger and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task Rock is also the founder,
proprietor, the dude for highly educated
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times if you go to a Cannabis
Cup event in California, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are probably the ones he goes to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to those Cannabis Cup events and
you go to the highly educated booth to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase some highly educated products,
you are probably going to pay your money
[SPEAKER_01]: to Task Rock directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be the dude there that helps you
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task is integral in the 710 community,
integral in the 710 movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been a big part of it since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a huge supporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task made up the number 710, not the
number, but the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: That mic stand might need a little bit of
Viagra.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mic got droopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a quick equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might just have to hold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need to give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: There happens to be Gatorade on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it a rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ignore it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll work again in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our boy Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: 710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without Task Rock, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big D is the person that gave me my very
first dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time he was with Broadway Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved on to be Top Shelf Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big D moved on to be the founder and
proprietor of the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Secret Sesh, the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one with the dragon and the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first hash competition I think I ever
attended.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one I ever heard about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Task.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys from Health Stone Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm going to give a little bit
of credit to Hitman Glass Duggee because
[SPEAKER_01]: he does make the rigs that a lot of us are
purchasing and smoking our hash through.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those guys are pioneers of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, in the hash movement,
Spence did a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Spence
and the Weeden crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole crew, they did a lot in the
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, we all owe a huge high five
to Derek Cummings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck Derek.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude did so much for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inside joke, but hashtag fuck
Derek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of an inside joke with all of
his friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Derek did a lot for learning about
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Derek did a lot of research and learned a
whole lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, there's Tony V.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of guys doing stuff
for hash and terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But shout out to all the people that
helped get 710 popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originated that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to play Task Rock at the end
of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the original people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many people involved in keeping
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fun to watch it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes so rapidly now that it's legal
that we can do whatever we want with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The equipment, the products have just...
Every couple of months, I got to go buy
[SPEAKER_01]: all new shit just to have what I need to
have to be on top of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like any other tech right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every six months, it evolves two to three
times faster and more effective than it
[SPEAKER_02]: was before.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terps are available by themselves now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's every part of the legal marijuana
industry, which is fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a huge variety of products about a
year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all getting really, really,
really good now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so much fun to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to legalize it where you
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when I was the only one that had
little jars of terps on the table?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you probably will be for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're available at a lot of shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are eating them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are probably like,
where the fuck are terps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps are terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenoids are the compounds that mainly
provide the flavor and aroma to your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and or cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are they're part of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The palates and the esters have a lot to
do with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavonoids have a lot to do with the
flavor, obviously, but the terpenoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly what play the part of the flavor
that work on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mostly the part that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also contribute to your high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush one makes me a little more mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me a body thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of makes my body go one,
one, one, one, one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ghost train haze makes my head go
like I just dabbed a fucking bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: rocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, essentially, that's what separates
indica from sativa is what you've refined
[SPEAKER_02]: into that tiny little jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything around the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's some other stuff that goes
into that, but yeah, it's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had to describe somebody to
somebody, you had to show them strongly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the difference between indica and
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would definitely be a good way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two is a heavy sativa, one's a heavy
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're way too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put them to bed with the O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, their problem was I'm way too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't give them another dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'd give them a dab of some really CBD
heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some CBD heavy dabs that would calm
them the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the cherry flavor, bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this talk about dabs has got me want
to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some of this mob boss shatter
and I've dumped it into some ghost train
[SPEAKER_01]: haze turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the turps on the tip of the
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like a little wet spot on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, tell all of our listeners how
they can find you on social media and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you include your Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can catch me at Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws on Facebook or at Nemo Punk
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dab was massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to turn colors right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to joke, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can turn colors without joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see now he's pasty white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's going to red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a proper set.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a shade of purple here in a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice dark red and then purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it for the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like having I've always
described haze strains and the ghost train
[SPEAKER_01]: haze is really it's definitely stands out
for what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a velvet thing that happens
on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like, like, you know,
when you smell lilacs or lavender,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's that specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost has a similar coating like that
that happens, but it's more enjoyable to
[SPEAKER_01]: me because I fucking hate lilacs and
lavender for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the smell of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes my nose feel like I got particles
in my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like lavender when I'm surprised
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we check into a hotel and we get
up to the room and it's all over,
[SPEAKER_02]: drives me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably worse shit in that hotel
room than that lavender, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I know, but it's the lavender
that I've like choke on and can feel in my
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth for like the next hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it definitely has a coating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we're just equally high.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to TASK.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something else I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode that is not really DAB
related, not really 710 related,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it needs to be mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amendment 139.
[SPEAKER_01]: Current event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bum, bum, bum.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly who put this petition
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a group that was petitioning to
limit all cannabis products to 16 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds that we grow at the Green and
Healthy Wellness, this shit tests anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: from 20 to 30 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is lower than 22, I wouldn't
guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average THC content in Colorado is 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who the fuck is growing that shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Step it up, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's actually a pretty solid demand
for stuff that's between like 12 and 16
[SPEAKER_02]: percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that retired after 35 years doing
shit they were drug tested for.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really don't want our moonshine
potency weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They freak out when they try to roll a
joint of it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they did back in 1974.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, just take a couple puffs and put
that fucker out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they like the whole like pass it
back and forth with their wife or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend who writes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so they like stuff that they can
smoke on a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just smoke on it and just have it burning
while he's writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a call for that, but the average
is 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: Estimates are that this should have shut
down 80 percent of the industry as we know
[SPEAKER_02]: it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would move to a place where I could grow
high quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well no, immediately all conscience rates
go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't have dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's the point of a vapor cart
that's 16 percent?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would fuel the black market so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the design is the people that
were behind it wanted it to kill the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that a public vote to end
Amendment 64 statewide would die
[SPEAKER_02]: laughably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was their more reasonable
attempt to give voters to go along with
[SPEAKER_02]: gutting the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were three parts to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to add child proof
packaging, which we already do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted us to add a health warning
that said this causes like irreparable
[SPEAKER_02]: brain damage or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already do health warnings that are
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're willing to add more reasonable
health warnings, but we're not really to
[SPEAKER_02]: add some random bullshit that you just
thought of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was going to limit potency to
16 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The group behind this claims they have 80
percent of the public support on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What public where?
[SPEAKER_02]: That they won't tell you, but they're
pretty sure it exists somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely didn't ask any dab kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 80 percent of the people at
the last anti-pop meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but 80 percent of the people in
Parker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my hometown.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they really, really hate marijuana
and they wanted to shut us down this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim they have a huge amount of
support, which is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they withdrew their effort today.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they essentially said they're going
to stop trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they stopped trying is kind
of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim that the group of marijuana
industry supporters and businesses that
[SPEAKER_02]: formed to oppose this effort called up all
of the petition signature gathering
[SPEAKER_02]: companies in Colorado that are good at
what they do and can actually get a
[SPEAKER_02]: statewide ballot effort on the signatures
collected because it's like one hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand or ninety eight thousand
signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are companies in Colorado that can
definitely get that done for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they all got a phone call from
the marijuana people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we're going to hire you for
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and bill us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just hung up the phone and they raised
enough money to apparently make that offer
[SPEAKER_02]: to the two biggest companies or three
biggest companies in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the off chance that anti-pop people
tried to hire all three, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared to pay all three to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the anti-pop people were like,
well, if we have to do this ourselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's go ahead and not do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me laugh, especially when
they're like, well, we have an 80 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: support of the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just they kind of played old school
drug dealer tactics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just pop it up on Facebook and you
say, hey, community that supports this so
[SPEAKER_02]: much, we need all of you to grab a
signature and take it to work the next day
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, hey, sign this 80 percent of it's
just such nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they didn't have 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they claimed that the marijuana
industry raised tens and tens of millions
[SPEAKER_02]: of dollars to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shit's public.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is know where to Google
and you can check how much there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the sad part is that if you
handed a petition to most people and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, hey, would you like to limit
the THC and cannabis to 16 percent?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the fuck they mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, stop bugging me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I sign, will you stop bugging me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ring that fucking bell if I sign this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that that sucks that people are just
willing to sign shit to without even
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and by law, you have to print the
actual language that you're asking people
[SPEAKER_02]: to sign for across the top of the sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be a separate page or nothing
like it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people we've we've discussed
this before on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people at Wal-Mart are in
their pajamas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nobody reads it even when you're
when you're out really collecting this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and trying to get people to give a
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one reads it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're just in a fucking hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to sign it and get you the hell
out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a resident?
[SPEAKER_01]: You live in the county, 18 sign here,
sign here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that shit got dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not pass, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave up because the group behind it
is has pledged to reform as a broader
[SPEAKER_02]: coalition of people uniting to fuck over
the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, it just sounds like a
whole bunch of bullshit, a bunch of big
[SPEAKER_01]: words that their lawyer typed for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny part is, is a big part of their
press release today, they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, this former high school principal
who was who was behind this said this and
[SPEAKER_02]: this this local parent who's behind the
other person behind this said this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sitting there reading a press
release from a major anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: personality in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the press release talks about major
funding from a national anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you keep reading the article,
it talks about the actual people behind
[SPEAKER_02]: the initiative who aren't these local
lovable characters like a teacher and a
[SPEAKER_02]: parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're major politicians from around the
country who make a living doing stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're able to portray it as like,
oh, there's there's just these little
[SPEAKER_02]: folks being picked on by big industry
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you threatened a billion dollar
industry and they raised three hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: grand to knock you out of the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just gave me a perfect segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we start wrapping up the show,
give me an update on what is going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: the effort to eliminate and or eradicate
recreational cannabis from Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so locally, our petition effort has
been significantly more successful than
[SPEAKER_02]: the one statewide.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have all their signatures turned in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they've got more than enough
valid signatures to make the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two questions in front of the
courts right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question is how many signatures
they should have collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: They collected five percent of the voter
signatures from that last election down
[SPEAKER_02]: here, which was like five thousand
signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They collected nine thousand almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're covered there if it's five
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But recently, a bill was passed at the
state level requiring this specific
[SPEAKER_02]: question if it's going to be put on a
ballot anywhere to have 15 percent of past
[SPEAKER_02]: voter signatures, which would jack that
number to around 14 or 15 thousand,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means they don't have near enough
signatures gathered and they need to get
[SPEAKER_02]: back out there and gather signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That decision should come any day now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's Friday when we're recording
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be Sunday when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll probably be within four or five
days of this coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get that decision, hopefully maybe
as many as 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're Rasta Seb, this will be
Monday because he's from the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully within seven or 10 days,
we get we get that first decision about
[SPEAKER_02]: how what percentage of the vote they
should have gathered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Odds are strong that the judge is going to
rule that five percent is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, we had a local politician make a
primary ballot and it ended up in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: the same judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the judge's ruling was, yes,
he failed to follow the law here and here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he broke that rule there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But elections are about choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why not give you guys him as one of
those choices?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people were like,
wait, what, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: But kind of, I guess, like the judge gets
to make the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why they wear the outfit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why they have the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let them make them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the decision they made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of expecting the same thing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another court issue that involves
some serious campaign finance stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: could really keep them off the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and pretty much every state in
the union has very serious laws that
[SPEAKER_02]: govern their elections.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you would like to put something on an
official election ballot, there are rules
[SPEAKER_02]: you must follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anti-marijuana people down here are
terrible at following rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very fun character trait for them
to have, if you're me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as they said they were running
a public ballot, I was hoping for like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, that's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of important ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't handle a licensing
hearing at the county level, running a
[SPEAKER_02]: county-wide ballot issue is probably going
to trip you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things is you can't raise money
in a jar to fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a thing in politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's donations over $20,
I got to get your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get your serial number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just how elections go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The money is tracked like that unless
you're super rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by which case you can donate hundreds
of millions of dollars to a company to run
[SPEAKER_02]: evil attack ads and shit, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a little guy trying to give
$24, you got to give me your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your serial number.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just throw a jar up on the piano
and at the end of the night have 300 or a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand bucks in there and call it good
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did that twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's major polling that
they've bragged about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people don't understand what kind
of money is involved when you poll people
[SPEAKER_02]: in a county like Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not a big county.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only 150,000 people down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A poll like that still costs 10,
15, 20, $25,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good ones cost 25, 35, $40,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that'll really give you the
information you want are expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid for one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know all about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason, they're lying about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to play out really
interestingly in court.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have access to the truth on those
surveys?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what the results they got
back, but we know they bragged about them
[SPEAKER_02]: enough for the local hospitals to put
literature together that referenced the
[SPEAKER_02]: polling done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know who did the poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know who paid for the poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know who probably got handed the check
that paid for the poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know who probably cashed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disturbing that they're lying about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All they had to do was put it on their
campaign finance report and nobody gives a
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they keep claiming to the press
that they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually the judge is going to want
to know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an issue that could keep them
off the ballot too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the money in the jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big enough screw up to keep you
off the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make law, you got to follow
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they hire a lawyer?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their main volunteer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's donated like $10,000 or $12,000 worth
of lawyer hours to their effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what he charges,
but that's on their campaign finance
[SPEAKER_02]: reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent a disturbing amount of time
going through those reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to work on campaigns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The look on your face when you talk about
it is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It very well could be the death of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really can't handle the loss this would
be to our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were on the edge for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parts of town are still very, very bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crime is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Infrastructure spending is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we lose 60% of our construction
industry, 1,300 marijuana jobs,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the expansion that industry is
supposed to go through over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: several years, all of that real estate
floods back onto the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a death blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those people that moved here because
somebody like myself had a job and was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I need a helper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got somebody that I know in another
state that I trust, brought them out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people and myself would be fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge note.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with five people that moved here
within the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people are employed by the spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 30, 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of them are there in Pueblo West?
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1,300 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, if this vote passes,
1,300 people are out of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a full 1% of our population down
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add that immediately to the
unemployment rules and then you compound
[SPEAKER_02]: that with all of, it's not like I got
fired for stealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1,300 people got put out of work
because an industry closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one gets to apply for the job I just
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us are now applying for whatever
jobs were currently available when our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What percentage of those people go home
and buy a bunch of fucking lights with
[SPEAKER_01]: their first unemployment check and build a
black market, grow and start flipping
[SPEAKER_01]: black market weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do about 20 million in annual sales
down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure half of that immediately goes
back into the black market and the other
[SPEAKER_02]: half goes either up the highway to
Colorado Springs or down the highway to
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tourist money goes to Trinidad and
Manitou, the medical money goes to
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who doesn't feel like that's an
effort worth putting in for a bag of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: just goes back to the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put some seeds in the dirt in the
basement, shine some lights on that bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lose out on five million in tax revenue
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's paying for all kinds of cool shit
that wasn't getting paid for before
[SPEAKER_02]: because we didn't have the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city is starting to look decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potholes are going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to look- Little by little,
stuff's getting more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that the last street I drive on
on my way to your place just got repaved.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing's been jacked since I've known
about Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole boulevard has been wrecked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot for potholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just little by little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, why aren't our schools
perfect?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had legal weed for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't all our streets perfect?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any info on the scholarship
that was awarded to the child via the
pothole?
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor doubled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was king of the world, the
scholarship would be bigger and spendable
[SPEAKER_02]: in more places, but it's still really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sending 25 kids to college that
probably wouldn't have been able to go
[SPEAKER_02]: without that two grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain a little bit how that happened to
people that haven't kept up at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our local county commissioners,
the voters passed a local excise tax,
[SPEAKER_02]: so all of the production when you grow
marijuana and then sell it to a retail
[SPEAKER_02]: store, it gets taxed at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That money goes into a slush fund for
dream projects we couldn't pay for before.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grow the flowers at Green and
Healthy Wellness, they have to be packaged
[SPEAKER_01]: and then transferred to the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the tax happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was in Pueblo County, that's where
the tax would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Colorado Springs passes an excise tax
on medical, then it'll happen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already did that down here for rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first year that tax has been
in effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Money's just starting to trickle in,
but we expect $3.5 million from that
[SPEAKER_02]: excise tax this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bulk of the marijuana taxes
that Pueblo County is going to make next
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get 3.5 from the excise tax-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an estimate so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how it actually plans out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're definitely going to get 1.7 to
1.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: In licensing fees and sales tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the industry exists?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's through the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if the election goes against us in
November, we still get to operate until
[SPEAKER_02]: next November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your licenses can expire as it comes up
for expiration until November 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shop that gets their license in
November the 1st of this year is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: best shape to operate as long as possible,
regardless of the election outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a death blow to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing so much with, it's not a lot
compared to our whole county budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with our county budget is that
it passed its breaking point a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollars ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to look at middle school kids
walking in the middle of the street with
[SPEAKER_02]: the buses and the car traffic and go,
sorry, no money for sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or crossing guards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or books.
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took asbestos out of a couple of
schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read that in the newspaper and I was
like, asbestos in schools, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hurting my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was way down in San Juan County
because that's how we're spending that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state also collects an excise tax and
the first 40 million from that fund goes
[SPEAKER_02]: to school construction through our state's
best program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best program, literally when you
apply for it, you explain how your school
[SPEAKER_02]: districts broke, how they've never had
money since the 40s and how you badly need
[SPEAKER_02]: to do stuff that should have been done 30
years ago, but you've never found a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're doing stuff like taking the
lead out of the pipes, taking the asbestos
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the gym, putting pads in the
playground, or building a playground
[SPEAKER_02]: period, paving the road to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of crazy stuff that we really
should have done decades ago, but just
[SPEAKER_02]: never had the money and we were never
going to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we can fund it with weed money
because it's just enough more than what we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to do everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't getting funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So loop us back around to the
scholarships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry, the scholarships they gave each
kid that wanted up to 400 kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 kids got a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was the offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 25 ended up applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason for that is you have to
be a Pueblo high school graduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had way more than 25 of those
dicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone thinking that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you had to go to college in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, if I was king of the world,
it'd be at least anywhere in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Nebraska don't need my fucking
weed money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to keep the money in the
county.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they just wanted to keep it in the
county.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to promote the local
university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of cool things happening
down here at our local university.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not keep it all local?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good music program, a good mass
call program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know about other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor liked the program so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used state marijuana taxes to double it
to two grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, honestly, that's books.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's meals for most of a whole year,
for half a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on if it's you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I was a college student.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of these numbers aren't real
unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might just be a decade old,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, $2,000 down here in Pueblo,
that's fully the difference between I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: able to go and I'm not able to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if $2,000 is going to really
make or break that difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: like college in New York or wherever else,
I'd be happy to send you with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: $2,000 probably wasn't a make or break
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it requires a lot more to live out of
state than it does in your hometown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd still stay with the fam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that takes out a huge amount of huge,
huge amount.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a fantastic program and the
anti-pop people are all over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, this is just propaganda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, oh, we're making sure that
more kids get to go to college propaganda
[SPEAKER_01]: when that kid goes to college.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that propaganda?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some real shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things people won't refuse to
accept is that marijuana was always here
[SPEAKER_02]: in a way that's so much larger than anyone
really wants to admit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's 60 billion coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six zero billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a huge amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody can fathom that much
cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, yeah, in $20 bills,
it's a couple of high schools full
[SPEAKER_02]: probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it's an insane amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all just under the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the park your kids play at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the school your kids go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even the fucking prisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like prohibition doesn't work at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right under our noses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always has been, it always will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just mostly invisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only people who are able to be visible
with it are the people with nothing to
[SPEAKER_02]: lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one's willing to admit that in
Colorado anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's like, it's new, especially the
anti-pop people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we did was shift where people buy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're able to do so many cool things
with that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a legit industry now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make Terps because now we got
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to be afraid to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get caught buying the equipment
that it takes to make these Terps at the
[SPEAKER_01]: store, they turn you in for making a
fucking meth lab back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it can be like, no, we're with
this dispensary and we need all this
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can more effectively treat
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone forgets about the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all about getting Terped out now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to spend the first 20 minutes with
a new big fat bag of weed, looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: mold, looking for mildew, looking for
washers, spider eggs, all kinds of nasty
[SPEAKER_02]: funks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten toenails in weed before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit there breaking a bud and have a bug
crawl out of the noggin up your arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was the shit we used to put up
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that it's all gone now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The benefit stream, it's endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so far past the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a place like Pueblo, the money's
vital.
[SPEAKER_02]: South of us in town, even smaller,
the sheriff was in the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure what to think at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look what it's done to the downtown area.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've built a river walk down there
because of cannabis money.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinidad's not going to die now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had steel here and steel isn't as big
as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to go lightweight now,
so it's titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have a titanium mill,
we have a steel mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people were leaving and people
don't want to work at a steel mill forever
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the technology era.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This town was going bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I have been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were here before all the cannabis shit
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have seen this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a little cow town when I
moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's flourishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's actually going somewhere now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finally crawling under the funk we
were in for like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flood fucked us up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it was when the steel mill
started to slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole huge generation of people didn't
have an easy way to feed their families
[SPEAKER_02]: down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't easy to find work anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really had to work at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved here, you had to know
somebody that was hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how this town is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those towns where you could
fill out a thousand applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you know somebody here,
you're not going to get a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the job and housing listings never
make it online here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drive up and down the streets you want
to live on and look for someone putting
[SPEAKER_02]: out a for rent sign and walk up and talk
to that person before it sits out there
[SPEAKER_02]: too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing with jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard a friend of yours got fired,
wander into wherever they used to work and
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to the manager stat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise there ain't no job for
you in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's slowly changing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have hiring or staffing agencies now
that help people get a foothold in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an industry down here that's going
to need a hundred more trimmers next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Linus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real downside is that we're not
publicizing in all 50 states what it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: to work in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that they can show up late
and take a shit and be 20 minutes late and
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk to people every day that are
shocked to learn it's like a real
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think you can just hang out and smoke
joints all day and fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they thought their high school weed
dealer had a store now where he just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like hung out and played Xbox and then
made you weed at his table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you gave him money and it was
weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'd leave and they walk in and
they see what looks basically like an
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple store or a purse or shoe store in
the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave me a chance to tease
something that we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to wait until you and Lindsay are
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about the weirdest
shit that people have ever done in a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was asked to do that episode too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today by someone at work who listened to
the dispensary etiquette episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about that when Lenz
is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lenz just got back from a little vacation
and she took the night off.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was invited, but she needed a nappy
poo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's cuddled up with Scooby,
Scooby the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up Scoob?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Scoob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to that air conditioner over
there, but we're going to get Lenz on and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to talk about some weird shit
that's happened in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a pretty good story myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensaries are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really magical place where the
bananaramic shit happens on the regular.
Still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when we had a store way back in
the wild fucking West days, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy shit that would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to save those stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a cheesy ass grin on my face because
we ran the place before you could get a
[SPEAKER_01]: weed card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day you could walk in and go,
my leg hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need weed card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd say, how much money you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd tell them they'd write you that
many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great fucking day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even care back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like weed card for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was the, in the very first
days, like even the doctors were at the
[SPEAKER_02]: fringe of society because the DEA was
still threatening that if a doctor wrote a
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation for marijuana in Colorado,
that they could lose their DEA license to
[SPEAKER_02]: write prescriptions for anything,
any other drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the doctors that were like the
first five doctors in Colorado to sign
[SPEAKER_02]: paperwork period were the kind of doctors
where like, if you were there because you
[SPEAKER_02]: fell on something and it went through like
your forearm or your leg, you'd start
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 15 minutes or so, you'd be like,
you know what doc, I'm just going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: next doc up the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't care that I'm impaled for
something that's not going to kill me
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that changed six months later when
they stopped hounding doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that weird ass doc that used to
come to a ponytail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the ponytail.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was the husband.
[SPEAKER_02]: The husband had a ponytail and a cane.
[SPEAKER_02]: The doctor was the woman who wouldn't look
you in the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the crazy guy and the
crazy wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lady that owned that dispensary used
to bake edibles and she would show up with
[SPEAKER_01]: trays of edibles and she'd be like,
Mike and Jeff, you have to try some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brownie, this carrot cake,
this fucking banana bread, this cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the nine products I make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your nine samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you restock the shelves with the
rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then five minutes later she'd go,
which one did you eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd go, it's 11 AM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, where?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she would go, well, which one are you
going to eat right now in front of me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she'd stare at you and then look
at the pile of options you had,
[SPEAKER_02]: really curious as to what you might pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally oblivious that you took this a
little more seriously than she did,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're not interested in finding out
how strong she made them this week at 11
[SPEAKER_02]: AM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 15 minutes after you ate the first
one, she'd ask you what the next one was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some days where I don't know
how we made it through clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some times that the numbers
were a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some days I wasn't sure people
were keeping numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty sure there were some eight
gram quarters going out the door
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was a window that we had to
stay with in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just kind of kept it from going too
far outside of that little box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Karen and her homemade
edibles that used to suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still dream about that banana bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh and I fell down the stairs,
like fucking rolled down the dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a switch downstairs too and they
would tumble down it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laughing like ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember walking up three flights of
stairs in ridiculous heat because it got
[SPEAKER_02]: really hot in that building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd get to the third floor knowing
that that was where I needed to go and
[SPEAKER_02]: have no idea why I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd get halfway back downstairs before
I remembered whatever it was I went up
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That place was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of edibles, I'm pretty sure I
mentioned eating a 1000 milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, excuse me for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 1000 milligram edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't eat a 1000 milligram edible unless
you want to be fucked up for a day and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not me, probably three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like a civilian, if you gave that
to anybody else that we know that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke like a soldier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull up an article at home
entitled, I drank the weed lube.
[SPEAKER_02]: She claims to be high for three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 100 milligram edible, if people get
novices gobble that sucker up six,
[SPEAKER_02]: eight hours is what people report.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just you ate the 100 milligram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff's talking about a 1000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I ate a 1000 milligram edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honest, I haven't been I've been gun shy,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't eaten an edible since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it to myself the other day and it
wasn't even with a really big dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I popped a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I'd be comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to the movie theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked up and was just blown the fuck
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were so many food choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I could figure out what I
wanted, I heard my wife giggling next to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not a smoker, but she knows when I
look up and I'm just too big to pick from
[SPEAKER_02]: the menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't mean to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it happens to the pros.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, the 1000 milligrams was rough
on my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole body felt weird for a day and a
half.
[SPEAKER_02]: People assume that that's like the
comfortable intro to to marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like smoking is the time
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking flowers through a pipe,
smoking flowers through a bong or a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get used to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take like three dabs in one day and then
start taking big dabs and then dab every
[SPEAKER_01]: day and then eat some edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Progress slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a good rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can you can look people in the eye and
say, I don't inject what I'm addicted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just buy glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same different kind of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just rig after rig after rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass
517 South Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a rig, you really need to
legalize it in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really can't stress the benefits
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your table look like mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's glass rigs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want you want to hear this kind
of shit in your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to hear glass rigs thinking on
each other all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's 85% of the table cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's giving a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the table is covered in oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to give away something again.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants this old shoe?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really ironic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another story that matches up with
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stepped in dog shit today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time in a really long time that
I stepped in dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stepped in some shit today.
