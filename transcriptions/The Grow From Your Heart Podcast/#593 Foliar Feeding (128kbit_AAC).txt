[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and it is time for episode 593 of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this show off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Chem Dog D
T1000 Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Chem Dog D and T1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
gas, lavender, and grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know that I'm not a big fan of
lavender flavors and aromas, but luckily,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes through with sort of a perfumey,
floral sort of aroma and flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mix is dominated by that gassy
grape flavor, and I do enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 69.81% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD, perfect for a podcast
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the Chem Dog D T1000
Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read an
email about foliar feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few of the folks in the 710
[SPEAKER_00]: club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
Heart Podcast thank you shout out to a
[SPEAKER_00]: longtime supporter and a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a special thank you shout out
to my buddy John Bendit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a thank you
shout out to Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout out to Jake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a thank you
shout out to Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's jump into a thank you shout out
to my buddy Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a fist bump to my buddy
Dave's Not Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a thank you shout out for
my buddy Terp Burglar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a special Grow From Your Heart
Podcast thank you shout out to Dr. Dindro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a thank you shout out to
Smokey J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a thank you
shout out to Dayron T.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a special thank you shout
out and a fist bump to my buddy The
[SPEAKER_00]: Bafsta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast thank you shout out to my buddy
North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you'd like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the information you need will be
right there on the screen and I did
[SPEAKER_00]: include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it super
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thank you guys for all of the
continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, without all of the
Patreon support, I wouldn't have all this
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy lighting, I wouldn't have the fancy
new camera, wouldn't even have the fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: new computer and there is an even better
computer on the way because when I bought
[SPEAKER_00]: a 4K camera, this computer said,
that's cute, I can barely handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a new computer coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody for the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me and it does keep
the show coming to you for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of folks who are not able
to contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks who do contribute are keeping
this show coming to everybody for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, where are we gonna go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a recent episode about tester
applications and tester expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you wanna run test seats
for me, there is a process to submit an
[SPEAKER_00]: application to become a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to everybody who submitted a
tester application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an overwhelming response,
an overwhelming amount of applications
[SPEAKER_00]: were submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to catch up on all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, do not stop sending
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am overwhelmed, I'm overloaded,
but I want more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep me working, keep me busy,
keep me digging through those
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please continue to send in your tester
applications if you are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main things in that episode was
being able to follow instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were very specific instructions on
how to submit a testing application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not follow those instructions,
I probably did not notice your
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one way to submit that
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the other ways will be ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to be rude about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, you gotta be able to follow
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I've got you in my email,
then it's easier to find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna look across all of the
social media platforms to find tester
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them to me in one spot or listen to
the episode again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that help tab on my website,
I've added a grow help tab on iregenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to iregenetics.com, there is a
tab that simply says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on that grow help tab,
it will ask you about seven or eight key
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically asks what is the temperature
and humidity of your grow environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the last feed and pH and EC of
your last feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can get a few details about what's
happening in your grow before I even try
[SPEAKER_00]: to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to the grow help tab,
you'll fill out a little questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me the temperature, tell me the
humidity, tell me what you fed,
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me the pH and EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tell me what's wrong with your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will save us both a few steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to email me and they
say, bro, here's what's wrong with my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got like seven or eight
follow up questions just to go from what
[SPEAKER_00]: they asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having to ask those questions,
they're already there on the sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna tell me so many key
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna give me so many hints to help
me diagnose your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm basically just giving you a little
checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like when you go to the doctor,
checking your temperature, looking in your
[SPEAKER_00]: ears, looking in your nose, checking out
your throat, looking for oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obvious shit, maybe I can diagnose
problems from those small obvious details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna ask you to fill out that
questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you send me, then there's a little
part that says, what's your problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on when you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that out, send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes to my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gotten a lot of great questions and
a lot of great content for the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: from that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you feel like you have not been
replied to or responded to in a timely
[SPEAKER_00]: manner, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, I have been
overwhelmed in a good way with tester
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and grow help questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't feel like I'm ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But irie genetics is a one man operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow from your heart podcast is a one
man operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Mike's not on the show, if I don't have
a guest, this is just a solo one man
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team Rasta Jeff is, I do have the irie
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of helpers doing things
like that, but packaging the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding the seeds, doing the podcast,
it's all just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the emails are all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with all of that being said,
keep that tester applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep it all coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one more thing to talk about on the
website, iregenetics.com, there is a spot
[SPEAKER_00]: to sign up for a mailing list for a
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to find on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spot to type in your email
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in a good email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get an auto respond from my
MailChimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically says, Hey, thank you for
signing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you know it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know you signed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I do special deals at a vendor
like seedsherenow.com, you will get a
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for stuttering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a notification, a newsletter
for things like sales at seedsherenow.com
[SPEAKER_00]: for new strain releases, exclusive strain
releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do, I just put out a new strain
that nobody knew was even coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed up at seedsherenow.com for the
Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people on the newsletter knew that
that was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stay tuned for exclusive drops,
re-releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me when stuff will be
restocked at certain places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I include that in the
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to overload you, but I do try to
keep you in the loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing about once a month right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may increase to once a week if it
doesn't annoy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let me know how many updates you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it becomes annoying, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather settle down than lose you as a
follower and as a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign up for the MailChimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll get, you'll stay in touch with
the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get updates from all things Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where else was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: The help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your questions and also the tester
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also if I don't keep up with you right
away, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've got one more thing to ask for
before we jump into some of these grow
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like a cool little logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ask you for a lot, but I would
like a cool little logo just to put right
[SPEAKER_00]: about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right about there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how I'm going to edit this,
but right about here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool if it just said GFYHTV
and had a cool little red, yellow and
[SPEAKER_00]: green Rasta colored logo maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just something real simple that I
can just drag into the video every time
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it right there on the bottom right
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it would look cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make me look super official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be red, yellow and
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pay you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If more than one person submits it,
I'll rotate them out, put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the screen, give you some credit
and the credits at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pay you in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we gots to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: GFYHTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a little logo for the bottom of the
screen right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a red, yellow and green Rasta
colored logo, it is traditional that the
[SPEAKER_00]: red goes on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let's just stay respectful to the
Rasta tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that was it before we jumped
into the grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work our way right into a couple
of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gotten this question from multiple
people, from multiple formats and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen this asked all over social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to address this one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this often, probably once
every three to six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to remind people of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask quite a bit when I am growing
from seed and the seed pack says that the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are going to take 70 days in flower
is that or they're going to take 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to take 70 days from the day
I plant it or from the day that I put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they're auto flower plants,
the 70 days is the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long you should expect them to
be in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them for a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them for nine months if you've
got the space and you know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are putting on there as the time
on the back of the package is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time unless you are working with
auto flowers and that should be clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with auto flowers,
that time that's listed on there is the
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated predicted time from start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were working with regular photo
period or feminized photo period seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that time that we list on the back,
the flowering time, is from the day is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time, not the full grow time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another thing I want to
clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flowering time starts from the day
you turn the light cycle to 12-12,
[SPEAKER_00]: not from when you start seeing bud
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about day 12, day 14, day 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering cycle officially begins the
day you or somebody else turns the light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is in an indoor grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flip that light cycle to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You write that down on the calendar as day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at a pack of seeds and
they say we finish in 63 to 70 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: day one starts right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect that pack of seeds to be done in 63
to 75-ish days.
[SPEAKER_00]: As breeders, we really try to label the
packages clearly and tell you how long to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you a time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are putting plants in different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your environment, I'm not sure what
you're going to do to them to speed them
[SPEAKER_00]: up or slow them down, but from our
testing, from what we have seen through
[SPEAKER_00]: research with most of these plants,
that is the time frame we have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get myself back on track,
back to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say flowering time is 70 days,
we mean that is from the day you turn your
[SPEAKER_00]: timer from if it's 24 on and zero off or
18-6 or whatever your vegetative cycle is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you put it on 12-12,
that is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when your 70-day flowering time
begins, not when you see the pistils,
[SPEAKER_00]: not when you see bud development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not have seen it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, do you start counting flower right
when you see the pistils or when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: nubby or when they're growing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you fucking do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know when day one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we changed the fucking light
cycle ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not put so much guessing into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's narrow down what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's narrow down the variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that day one was the day that we put
that bitch into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, start counting from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a mark of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that maybe you've got five or six
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest one it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says day 70, cut one down at 68,
one at 69, one at 70, one at 71,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one at 72 and see what the difference
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or go even more staggered with your
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go 65, 70, 75, 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is fun to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main point is the flowering time,
day one starts when you flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the timer, not when you start seeing
those little fuzzies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, you will hear about that again
on the show because it gets asked very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move into a more advanced
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is about foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, let's see,
do they want their names said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure they want their names said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna not do that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, on the Breeder
panel yesterday, you sounded awesome and
[SPEAKER_00]: your mic was booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they were referring to is I was on
a Breeder panel on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a live Breeder panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were able to chat with the Breeders
while they were on the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could watch on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to be doing another
panel on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I don't know that I should
announce this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not set in stone, but to the best of
my knowledge, I'm going to make it happen
[SPEAKER_00]: on December 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we commit to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: JR, I'm in, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't back out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: December 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be doing a live panel, a live show
on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: JR and Q Gros will be interviewing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a question and answer panel
and I may even bring a couple of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends on from Cannibuzz to join me on
Zoom and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may let them ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may do some chatting, some
bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may even take some dabs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So December 19th on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be in the afternoon time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've set a solid time yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a one to two hour show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually what we like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already on Cannibuzz,
you're fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a free application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on whatever kind of phone
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on your iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works best on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to your app store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Download Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: C-A-N-N-A-B-U-Z-Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create yourself a username.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click like on all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you gotta do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay attention Saturday to Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: December 19th, there will be an Iri
Genetics Cannibuzz live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they've got in store for
me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be prepared no matter what
happens as a breeder, as a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to be there and have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just gonna relax because I am not
hosting the show, so it should be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannibuzz, December 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mic is booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was before I got this mic,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are double booming at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, you can always tell you
put a lot of time, effort, and money into
[SPEAKER_00]: your sound quality, and it's noticed and
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of funding to get this
microphone, all this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many things in this chain to
make all this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said it before, without Patreon,
it probably would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody for the Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys are noticing the
increase in audio quality, video quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: production, quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to see that I care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys definitely take good care of me
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to see that I appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just take all of your Patreon
funding and buy a new truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought podcasting stuff with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also trying to put a lot more time
and energy into the podcast because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm learning all this gear,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you have new toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a new video game or you get a
new toy, you want to go play with your new
[SPEAKER_00]: toys and video games.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a new rig, you want to take
extra dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like I want to podcast more
because I've got all this cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing slowing me down is this
computer and I've got a new one coming
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the ChemDog DT1000 live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some dabs of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in this episode, in this email,
and it says, thank you for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information you put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what nutrients and
supplements do you find more effective or
[SPEAKER_00]: effective as a foliar spray instead of the
standard root drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've read that kelp, humble
honey, and Kalmag can be more effective as
[SPEAKER_00]: a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about why and how
some of those things are more effective as
[SPEAKER_00]: a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, let's talk about foliar
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we foliar feed our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is foliar feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar feeding is exactly what it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix a light dose of nutrients into a
spray bottle or a sprayer, however you're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying your sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spray applications are much larger in a
commercial grow than they are in a private
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, I mix up a five
gallon bucket or maybe even larger of my
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a pesticide, if it's a booster
spray, I mix up a five gallon bucket and I
[SPEAKER_00]: use a paint sprayer to just douse all of
the plants with that spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grow, I use a small,
just a little Windex looking spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same idea no matter where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to mix up a light nutrient
solution, you need a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to feed the plants
foliarly, if you're going to foliar feed
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, I don't know the wordage
there, but if you're going to feed them by
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar method, you need to have a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just go mix it up newts and
spray them in there because they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way different than feeding them to
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going straight onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I basically mix up a light nutrient
solution and I spray it onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do this, the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it very important to always spray
with the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some products do say you can spray with
the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to turn the lights off when
I'm foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those little bubbles that land
on the plants on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you were a little kid and
used to burn ants with the magnifying
[SPEAKER_00]: glass or you could catch shit on fire with
the magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same exact method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun or the grow light comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits that bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubbles got that little arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: That arc creates a some sort of
refractory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a light and sun scientist,
but we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates some sort of a thing that works
like a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when you used to hold the fucking the
sun and the magnifying glass just right
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would create a hot spot on
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light will come down and do the same
thing to that bubble of foliar spray and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll put little burn spots on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make you panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll think you've got bugs or some sort
of deficiency when really all it was was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little water burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So foliar feeding is very important to be
done in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why would we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can apply specific nutrients to
the plant at specific times and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: we've already watered the plants and they
may be wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a seven gallon pot,
when you water that plant, it may be wet
[SPEAKER_00]: for three to four, maybe five days,
depending on the size of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a nutrient deficiency you're
chasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't water in more nutrients,
but we can foliar feed some nutrients into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of nutrients that work
very well being foliar fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more effective than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will touch on that in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that I am keeping up
with my notes so we can provide nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're chasing a deficiency,
we can absolutely provide most nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to the leaves and not have to
feed it through the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more faster acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, you won't walk out your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are already wet,
like I said, you don't have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: watering shit in and you're not going to
walk out the roots by overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another opportunity to provide
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you did say that you read that kelp,
Humboldt honey, and Kalmag were effective
[SPEAKER_00]: as foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave Humboldt honey out of
this mix because that is a product with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be safer to apply to
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some things in there that may
clog up your plants and it may be more
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it and it works,
keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wouldn't do that as a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kelp and the Kalmag absolutely do and
will work wonderfully as a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why I believe Kalmag is a
great foliar-fed nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag is what is known as an immobile
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't move itself around in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, if the plant sensed a deficiency
in a nutrient up in one part of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: older leaves that are kind of dying off
and that are going to expire would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send some of our mobile nutrients up
to that other part of the leaves so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can survive and be strong and healthy
since I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just pass the spoon right on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag does not have that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag is a very heavy nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why it is sold in a different
bottle than all of your other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put the Kalmag in the bottle with
the other nutrients, basically it's
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would fall to the bottom in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't stay in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would always be that shit at the bottom
of the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be stirring and shaking and it would
just be the coffee grounds in your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag is a non or an immobile nutrient is
what we call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can foliar feed that directly to the
plants and that will help you rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: correct a Kalmag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one thing that is great for a
foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag, calcium, works as a great foliar
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is harder to find a straight calcium
product, but Kalmag works as an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever brand of Kalmag you are using
will probably work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp, why does Kelp work well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp has a lot of hormones in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp has a lot of phytonutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all bio available to the plant by
foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients are mobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll spray those to the plant and the
plant, if you don't overdo it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll spray that onto the plant and it
will go, oh, maybe this leaf over here
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move that over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaf over here needs a little bit of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move that over here so the plants
will move those mobile nutrients around as
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically Kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things in Kelp I'm not
going to dig too deeply into.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be an episode on its own as
well as Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be a full episode on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure to stay on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen works as a great foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mix up a small amount of your base
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are getting a little bit
yellow and you can't feed them enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's called chasing the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey sometimes will become
nitrogen deficient early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like week two or three of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, why is that bitch going yellow
on me already?
[SPEAKER_00]: A really good, easy way to correct that is
a foliar feed of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your vegetative base nutrient and mix
up, I don't know what brand you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm not even going to make a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way less than what you would use when
you're feeding it to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like a quarter, maybe a fifth,
maybe even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up some of that base nutrient because
your base nutrient is high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your base nutrient into a bottle,
give it a good shake so it's nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emulsified might be the word I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And foliar feed that to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get the nitrogen into your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will say, hey, this is a mobile
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll move it all around to where it needs
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you chase and correct a
nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same with phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that as you increase
phosphorus, you do run the risk of a
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that sort of stuff in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about other things that I
do foliar feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMag works beautifully to correct a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can absolutely feed the NPK through
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch it move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you spray it in the dark,
give it like two hours for everything to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go back, you can see those plants
have greened up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I feel like I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really good relationship with
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see their reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like watching the look on people's
faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk in the room and you just say a
certain word, if you just say cheesecake,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you walk in the word and say
cheesecake, people make a certain face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk in the room and you say fart,
they make a different face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see my plants respond in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of relationship I have got
with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like after I foliar feed them,
I can walk in there and absolutely see
[SPEAKER_00]: results within just a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like a product called Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give me anything to talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from the same folks that make
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are called Hydroponic Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroponic-Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be .net, not .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Push is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got silica in there and it's got
another acid that I cannot remember the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of and I did not write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it works wonderfully for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think recharge makes the plants go
kaboom at the root zone level and Push is
[SPEAKER_00]: recharge for the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is recharge for the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Push is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about foliar feeding,
always use low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely burn your plants by
foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can absolutely apply too much and
unlike when you overfeed the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much harder to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike when you overfeed the root zone,
you don't have a lot of opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no chance to fix your mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overfeed the root zone,
they start showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, I'm going to kind of brown up
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get kind of my nails done and
burn up at the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got time to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flush that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed it something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sprayed it on there, you just
spray painted problems onto your plants if
[SPEAKER_00]: you overfed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work your way up, but you can't
work your way down from a burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're new at foliar feeding,
don't go in there and spray the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking crop all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe spray one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it reacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe spray two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn on a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't destroy everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a couple of test dummies in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment before you go hard on the
entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, always spray in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies will tell you that their
product is safe to spray when the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen terrible burns on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you should spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to argue with me over
this and that is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not spray microbes products in an
organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a TLO system, if you're
running labs and other things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that stuff in your no-till organic
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running, I run a very
commercial style grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of TLO love happening in
my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cocoa and salts and pesticide sprays
and foliar sprays for boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my environment, I would not recommend
microbe sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does give you the opportunity for
more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we have to pass microbe
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our buds, not all of our buds,
a sample from every batch is sent to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are tested for the presence of
yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are spraying products like,
I'm never going to say any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're spraying microbe products on our
plants, we are increasing the opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to fail those microbe testings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you are running some sort of
organic no-till living soil, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about, you organic hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running that sort of stuff,
then I do encourage you, do your crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with that and
you're not running that type of grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will set yourself up for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you foliar spray, you're going to
increase the humidity of your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be the best idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe have your exhaust fans and
dehumidifier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to clean your
dehumidifier more often if you're foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding because some of that funky shit
will end up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients will end up in your
dehumidifier filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're mixing up your foliar feed,
I've said it, shake the shit out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: spray or just shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's all mixed up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to feed, the bottom stuff
is heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cal Mag will be at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen will be up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to feed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, use some sort of a wetting agent
when you're applying foliar feeds and or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like Coco Wet works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet Betty works just fine if you want to
use that brand or a couple of drops of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic dish soap would do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is this makes it spread and
stick to your leaves a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer this stuff spreads and sticks
to your leaves, the more available it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will just run off and drip onto the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you didn't just foliar feed the
floor and waste all your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got something else I
wanted to say on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to act like I remembered
what I was saying because I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make small bubbles,
so I recommend that you wear protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wear personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always absolutely wear goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use a paint sprayer,
if you're going to use a sprayer,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some sort of mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend some sort of a respirator,
especially with the paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating micro bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we spraying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, potassium, Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to breathe in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bubbles of Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that's really good for
any part of your body, so please wear
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment when
spraying anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying a pesticide,
if you're spraying a boost, if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying water, put on some personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to breathe in these bubbles,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to breathe that stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep our lungs healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lungs are important, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do what we can to protect those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides and foliar feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with mixing a
foliar feed in with the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are applying a routine pesticide,
you can add push to that pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on the bottle of push,
do not mix with any other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not mix with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it countless times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it with a lot of different
nutrients, and I never see any adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like it's drinking,
it's kind of like drinking vodka and
[SPEAKER_00]: orange juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is going to fucking ruin my
body, but at the other time, I got so much
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin C that I feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really drink vodka and orange
juice, but I feel like if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray a pesticide to the plant that's
going to kind of beat up the plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, stress that plant out,
why not add some push to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of negate the
damage, give it a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll level out and get rid of the
bugs, boost the plants all at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can apply both at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will tell you to pH your
foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want acid rain on our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound like any fun for
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written that down a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you foliar feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just go in there and willy nilly
start spraying shit around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you spraying for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to give them a boost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to correct something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to prevent something?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a pesticide spray, if it's a
foliar feed, always have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as you are done spraying,
write down exactly what you sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was in the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of it was in the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many gallons were applied?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which plants were applied?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you only spray the veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you only spray the flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you only spray the large veg,
the small veg, the pre-flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the time and date.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you used a pesticide, write down the
re-entry time so you know when you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be standard for every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is required by law and in a
commercial grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: By law, by Department of Agriculture law,
by Department of Health law, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure there's some other people that
would probably whip your ass and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a ticket if you didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are required to keep documentation of
everything that was sprayed on those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pesticide application is required to
be documented by law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to keep it in a folder
for two to three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a Department of Agriculture
approved spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We write down everything that was fucking
sprayed, the date, the time, the amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a number, an EPA number on the
bottle that we have to include on that
[SPEAKER_00]: spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your initials, your MED badge number,
your Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: certification number, what time it was
sprayed, what time the spraying ended,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the re-entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is required to be written on a
sheet every time we spray something in any
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pesticide, not a booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could spray push and not have to write
it down, but if I put a pesticide in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, I would have to write that down for
the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I spray, I write down in my own
personal grow log.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if something goes wrong or if
something goes right, I can look back and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, what the fuck happened in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I spray something today, and in like
three or four days, I walk in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants look fucking decrepit,
I can look back in my notes and I can say,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I fed was normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was the new feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed them this fucking thing,
and they went ape shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can say, why do my plants look happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds have never been beefier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have never prayed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look back and say, oh, it's this new
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed that every three days instead of
every five days this time, and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep good notes on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always adjust and change your
strategy based on your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a scientific method that's
building a relationship with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understanding the products you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is becoming a solid grower,
so do that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the buds are getting big, you may want
to stop spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually quit spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray around day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may hit them with one final pesticide
spray, one final booster spray at day 21
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I avoid spraying if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that it does rain outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got chunky buds outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, the water,
the rain, the mist, the fog are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a lot of airflow and air
moving out there, but the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: resilient to moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do run into problems, if you do
have issues, there are products that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in flower as buds are developing,
but be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your research and understand what you
are applying to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it is necessary, please don't spray
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I said that they are
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes do work to keep the water
off the plants, but they also work like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to spray them,
just mist them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the booster or the pesticide or the
mildew remover, whatever you have to put
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that on there, but don't saturate
those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to wet up the spongy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause ourselves more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you've got to weigh your
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to spray them or do I just want
to accept the problem I've got?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you've got thinking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So foliar feeding is a really good way to
provide specific nutrients to our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: without overwatering or causing a lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good way to chase a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a nitrogen deficiency,
you can absolutely mix up some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe apply it two or three days apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it two or three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll absolutely see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to go harder, go harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, start your foliar
feed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use less than you think you need and
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't unfeed it, but you can feed it
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed it more if you need to,
but don't burn it by trying to fix it all
[SPEAKER_00]: in one spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of light coats may work better
than one thick coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works great because you don't have
to keep watering in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move the nutrients around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got to just get that Cal Mag where
it needs to be by spraying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is my foliar feed episode.
