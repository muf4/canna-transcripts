[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to the show podcast world it's
time for episode 378 of the grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast this episode is brought to
you by the hella dank seed company if you
[SPEAKER_00]: need new seeds in your garden I highly
recommend the hella dank seed company and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find them at www.dankseed.store
it's usually a tradition that I start the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast off by letting you know what I'm
smoking honestly today I feel like total
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and I haven't been dabbing I'm giving
my body a little bit of a rest I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: head cold I've got a chest cold I've got
this sinus thing going on that is driving
[SPEAKER_00]: me completely crazy so I'm not gonna take
any dabs before the show gonna try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: my shit together and deliver you guys a
decent podcast in the last episode I
[SPEAKER_00]: promised another grow lesson if you've
been following along you know I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a long series of grow lessons the
grow series started at episode 351 if you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't caught up I suggest you head back
to episode 351 and episode 351 we set a
[SPEAKER_00]: goal for our garden and then we move on to
selecting a space for our garden we also
[SPEAKER_00]: select the proper equipment then we build
the grow room then we talk about seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: clones then we veg our plants then we talk
about a few tricks and tips to get our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants up to speed for quality production
and at this point in my grow lessons it is
[SPEAKER_00]: day one of flower it is time to flip our
crop from the vegetative phase into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase of our grow so I'm gonna
press pause for a moment I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen back to this intro and see how I
sound and when I come back we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about flowering our new cannabis
garden alright podcast world I apologize
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do sound kind of crappy but the
show must go on I've been promising this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode I may make this one kind of quick
and then recap next week and move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: my original idea was to do a three-week
chunk of flowering episodes we would do
[SPEAKER_00]: week one through three and then four
through six and seven through nine but
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to focus on day one of week
one today and then we will adjust from
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the following episodes so let's
get started on flowering our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: garden what do I mean by flowering we want
to initiate the budding phase the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase for regular cannabis
plants is triggered by reducing the light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle if you were working with auto flower
plants you are in a total different
[SPEAKER_00]: ballgame those plants will flower when
they are ready for this discussion we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on regular photo period
plants and photo period seeds so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about flowering our photo period
garden initiating flower is very easy all
[SPEAKER_00]: we do is reduce the timer to 12 hours on
and 12 hours off we need 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted darkness every day to
trigger these plants to flower I've said
[SPEAKER_00]: it several times but I'm going to repeat
myself we need total uninterrupted
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness during the night phase for our
flowering plants a little bit of light is
[SPEAKER_00]: too much if you can see a pinprick of
light coming in that room it is too much
[SPEAKER_00]: light if you can see your hand in front of
your face during the dark phase in that
[SPEAKER_00]: room it is too much light those plants
know that that light is there they will
[SPEAKER_00]: not go to sleep properly they will not
flower properly if they do try to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: properly you give them the chance of
hermaphroditing on you in mid flower which
[SPEAKER_00]: will produce seeds in your garden which
will ruin your whole goal so we need 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: total darkness in our flowering room
during the night phase so switch the timer
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 12 be sure that you have got total
dark in that dark phase you need to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and look you probably need to hang
out in the grow room for about 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes for your eyes to adjust properly
to identify the most minimal light leaks
[SPEAKER_00]: you could possibly have so go in there and
check for light leaks on day one of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have any light coming in you need
to correct that that will ruin your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: so we've set the timer to 12 12 now it is
on for 12 hours a day and it is off for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day put a lot of thought into the
hours which your lights run do you want
[SPEAKER_00]: those lights to come on in the morning
when you wake up so you can water the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before you go to work and then the
plants are on all day while you're gone at
[SPEAKER_00]: work hopefully you get to come home and
check them out before the lights turn off
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you want those lights to come on in
the evening right when you get home from
[SPEAKER_00]: work and the lights can run all night
while you're home and you can check on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything maybe you can get up before
work and they're still on you can check on
[SPEAKER_00]: them again before you go to work and make
sure everything's cool I would put a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of thought into scheduling my flowering
cycle another thing to consider while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're planning your schedule is
electricity is cheaper during off peak
[SPEAKER_00]: hours that means that during the evenings
when everybody goes home and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling electricity gets cheaper during
the daytime business hours when
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's using all of the electricity
the electric company does charge you more
[SPEAKER_00]: for those peak hours what many folks will
choose to do is run those lights during
[SPEAKER_00]: off peak hours and save money on
electricity this is also advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is cooler during the evenings
you don't have the Sun up keeping your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room extra hot you're not heating the
outside with the Sun and the inside with
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow lights the Sun goes down and gets
a little cooler outside you can use that
[SPEAKER_00]: cool outside air to your advantage and
keep the grow room cool so think about
[SPEAKER_00]: your scheduling when do you want that 1212
on cycle to be when do you want that 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: off cycle to be if you do decide to run
your lights at night and have your dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle during the natural light cycle be
sure that no sunshine is creeping into
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room during that night cycle
again we need total darkness a very common
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake is that people flower their plants
at night which means they are in the sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle during the day which means there's
the opportunity for the sunshine to sneak
[SPEAKER_00]: into your grow room if you've got a window
if you've got a doorway if you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of insecure structure you can get
light in there very easily and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy your crop so you've thought about
scheduling and you know how it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work around your work schedule you know
how it's going to work around your life
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know when you're going to flower
these plants you know when you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to give them maintenance and work on
them and water them so plan your
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduling around that so we have set the
timer to 1212 that is day one of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that first short day is day one write that
day down too many people forget to write
[SPEAKER_00]: that down and they don't know how long
their plants have been in flower write
[SPEAKER_00]: down your flowering start date another
thing i want to make clear is this is day
[SPEAKER_00]: one of flower if you've got a package of
seeds and it says takes 70 to 80 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower this is the first day of that 70 to
80 days of that finishing time a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: folks like to start the flowering phase
when they see bud set starting when they
[SPEAKER_00]: see pre flowers you were 12 days into
flower by then and you were ripping
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself off flowering starts the day we
change the timer to 1212 that is day one
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower so we've now switched the timer
to 1212 the plants will be on for 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: a day and off for 12 hours they're going
to start flowering let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions we need to
provide for our flowering plants here at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of flower this will change
as the plants progress right now we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any buds to worry about there are
much less opportunities for mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: molds to take hold because when you get
those chunky buds the mildew likes to
[SPEAKER_00]: start in the middle of those buds that's
not really a worry right now so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: have the humidity a little higher at this
point we can have the temps a little
[SPEAKER_00]: higher at this point but as we progress we
are going to lower the humidity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in our flowering room to
accommodate those big chunky buds and to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent problems so at this phase of the
game it would be ideal to have your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit
I do not recommend higher than 80 I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend lower than 70 I understand that
you're struggling to keep your room cool a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of new growers have issues keeping the
grow room cool 84 is the max you ever want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit when you hit 85 degrees and higher
your plants will stop producing they will
[SPEAKER_00]: just go into a stagnant dead slowdown mode
how productive do you want to be when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 110 degrees outside you just feel like
shit you don't want to do anything you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to move the plants feel the
same way the plants can't move themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: to some shade the plants can't grab some
water and take a drink those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck there so give them the proper
environment don't go too hot don't go too
[SPEAKER_00]: cold at this phase of the flowering cycle
I would recommend 70 to 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit during your lights on cycle now
let's talk a little bit about the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: of this grow room during the start of the
flowering phase I like to have about 40 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 percent humidity earlier I said we
don't have those big buds to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: so we've just got a bunch of lush happy
plants they're just in there sucking up
[SPEAKER_00]: all that humidity and growing like crazy
so 40 to 50 percent relative humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 to 80 degrees during your daytime cycle
if you really want to dial that in I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you check out my episode about
vapor pressure deficit and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: episode number 314 if you're interested in
learning more about the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit which I find to be very important
when it comes to dialing in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly VPD will really improve the
productivity of your plants if you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it and dial it in correctly so
that is the daytime condition we want 70
[SPEAKER_00]: to 80 degrees during the day 40 to 50
percent relative humidity let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the nighttime temperatures when we turn
off the light things are going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: in that grow room I try to keep the
humidity right around the same levels at
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime at this stage of flowering I
want that 40 to 50 percent humidity during
[SPEAKER_00]: the night cycle now during the night cycle
I like it to get a little bit cooler it
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally cools off at night so I feel
like the plants probably enjoy a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit cooler of a temperature at night I try
not to go any more than 10 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: difference on a day and night temperature
that is called your diurnal temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and you don't want that to sway
more than 10 degrees so if during your day
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle here at 75 you do not want your
night cycle to get any lower than 65
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees I would generally try to keep it
about 5 degrees difference but I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand we're building new grow rooms
we are learning our setups we are learning
[SPEAKER_00]: to dial these rooms in 5 to 10 degrees is
acceptable for a diurnal temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: variation but if you go any more than 5 to
10 degrees differential in your day and
[SPEAKER_00]: night temperature you will cause problems
within the plant the plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: confused the plants will begin to grow
slowly and this is also a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: invite powdery mildew so try to keep your
temperature swings within 10 degrees from
[SPEAKER_00]: your day and nighttime temperature now
when you're walking through the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes just reach out and grab a plant
and feel the temperature of the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant warm is the plant cold how does
the plant feel to your hands if the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: feel really really cold they're probably
really cold and you could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the temperature of your room if
the plants feel like they're warm they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably warm you can probably lower the
temperature of your room in the future I
[SPEAKER_00]: do plan to do a discussion on leaf surface
temperature versus ambient room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature but we are not there yet so
let's stay focused here now one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: may have overlooked when I talked about
equipment is a hygrometer and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer or some sort of a monitoring
device to know what is happening in our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room at all times most of us growers
can probably afford the hygrometer
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer combo that sits in the grow
room and it marks the humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the room but it will also
mark the highest and lowest points of your
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and temperature so you can find
your peaks and your valleys and identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature and humidity fluctuations
in your room it's always nice to know
[SPEAKER_00]: where the peaks and valleys are but I like
to have more data I like to have something
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room they can tell me what's going
on at all times for a reliable monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: that can keep you up to date on what's
happening in your grow room at all times I
[SPEAKER_00]: would suggest something like a PO grow
systems minder unit or perhaps a smart B
[SPEAKER_00]: unit you can use both of those units to
monitor your grow room at all times you
[SPEAKER_00]: can pull up the data on your phone you can
see what's happening in the room in real
[SPEAKER_00]: time some of these types of units allow
you to actually plug in other devices and
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger them from your smartphone so if
you were away you open up your application
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that it's too warm in that room
you can say hey let's just easily turn on
[SPEAKER_00]: the air conditioner you can click a button
on a tab on your phone and it will fire up
[SPEAKER_00]: the air conditioner in your grow room and
you can rescue your garden while you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch hanging out with your friends and
you don't even have to leave the table so
[SPEAKER_00]: my point is have some way to monitor the
temperature and humidity in your grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: at all times I like to have a report of
what happens when those lights go off you
[SPEAKER_00]: have been running that grow light for 12
hours in that room you have created a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of heat you have created a lot of energy
all of that heat all of that light energy
[SPEAKER_00]: has created humidity there's water rising
up in the air now when we kill that light
[SPEAKER_00]: everything changes all of that humidity in
the air is no longer being heated it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to start falling it
becomes kind of thick in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: that short time period while the room
stabilizes itself out from that change is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often the cause of many of our
powdery mildew and boy tritus issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: many growers don't even know that that is
happening in the room at that time they
[SPEAKER_00]: look at their hygrometer they look at
their thermometer they say oh it was 72
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees in here that's acceptable oh it
was 45 percent humidity in here that's
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable you don't realize that there
was a point where it was 78 degrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: about 82 percent humidity in the room and
that's because we turned off that light
[SPEAKER_00]: all that moisture that was in the air is
now falling now the plants don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: light anymore so they are starting to
respirate a little bit they're letting out
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more moisture and all of that
chaos can really cause problems for our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in that type of environment so my
point is try to know what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally in your rooms at all times
all right it feels like we know what our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment should be like let's talk a
little bit about feeding our transitioning
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants if you are working in a
no-till bed or you're working with super
[SPEAKER_00]: soil there's no need to adjust anything at
this time just keep doing what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing you basically need to water the
plants throughout the flowering cycle if
[SPEAKER_00]: you plan on adding a cover crop or a top
dress or maybe feeding some teas you will
[SPEAKER_00]: need to adjust your teas at this time I
would take the nitrogen products out and
[SPEAKER_00]: focus more on the phosphorus and potassium
at this time if you're running teas or top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress or a cover crop now if you are
working with bottled nutrients you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably just swap out that veg bottle and
replace it with the flowering nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the bottle nutrient companies make
it very easy to follow their nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule so simply swap out that veg
bottle put in the bloom bottle and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything should be good to go the main
difference in our feeding schedule at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time is that we are going to reduce the
amount of nitrogen and we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly start increasing the amount of
phosphorus and potassium our plants take
[SPEAKER_00]: up approximately 80 to 90 percent of their
nitrogen during the veg phase once we
[SPEAKER_00]: switch them into flour they are done
sucking up nitrogen and they want more
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium so they can build
robust branches and big fat buds so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the nitrogen and start increasing
the phosphorus and potassium that part
[SPEAKER_00]: should mostly be covered by your base
nutrients if you're running a one bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient a two part or a three part
you should be getting the proper nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium from your base
nutrients now there are a few more things
[SPEAKER_00]: that these plants can use at this phase I
like to add silica when I am mixing up my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution I always put potassium
silicates in the water first the potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicates go first then I mix in my base
nutrients these plants can probably use
[SPEAKER_00]: cow mag at this point in time I also like
to give the plants some sort of a root
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant early in flower don't cut back
the microbes keep them going keep those
[SPEAKER_00]: roots growing strong keep them healthy the
plants will continue to flourish in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like some enzymes those enzymes
serve several purposes the enzymes will
[SPEAKER_00]: basically help to keep the root zone clean
and they will also break down any decaying
[SPEAKER_00]: root matter and turn that into usable
energy for my plants I also like to add
[SPEAKER_00]: some carbohydrates the carbohydrates serve
a couple of purposes those carbs will feed
[SPEAKER_00]: my microbes those carbs will also give my
plants energy between the carbs the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes and the mycos my root zone is
really healthy and really active which
[SPEAKER_00]: will show up top at the top of our plants
so we are focusing on nitrogen phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium at this stage we are
shifting away from the nitrogen more
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the phosphorus and potassium it's
always good to add cow mag a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a root inoculant I like some enzymes
always some carbs and to make everything
[SPEAKER_00]: pop I would add a little bit of fulvic
acid now if you have chosen to work with a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific bottled nutrient company most of
those companies have a nutrient calculator
[SPEAKER_00]: on their website so you can go to whatever
nutrient company dot com you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: their nutrient calculator you can type in
how many weeks you are going to flower you
[SPEAKER_00]: can click on which products of theirs you
have purchased and it will tell you week
[SPEAKER_00]: by week how much of each product to use
most of those charts are reliable but keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind they want you to continue buying
products so they may recommend you use a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more than necessary for an ideal
crop situation I generally reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended dosage by about 25 percent if
it says to feed 100 milliliters of your
[SPEAKER_00]: base product I would start off with 75
milliliters and see what happens we can
[SPEAKER_00]: always feed the plants a little more later
but we can never take out the feeding once
[SPEAKER_00]: we've put it in so don't burn the plants
wait for them to show you that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: happy or that they are angry and adjust
from there most of these nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: companies offer a fairly balanced diet
within their own product line you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have to reach out to another
brand or another company and fill in
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that they are missing if you do
choose to mix nutrient lines be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful that you don't double up on
anything when nutrient company A made
[SPEAKER_00]: their product lines they made five bottles
and they put the base newts in one they
[SPEAKER_00]: put the cow mag in the other they put the
humic acid in another and a bloom booster
[SPEAKER_00]: in another they know what is in each
bottle and they can recommend your feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know they're not going to
overdose anything with their design when
[SPEAKER_00]: you introduce a product from another
company you run the risk of doubling up on
[SPEAKER_00]: specific nutrients nutrient company A and
nutrient company B did not talk to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other about their designs so you may be
running a base product from nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: company A then you may have a bloom
booster from nutrient company B those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies didn't talk company A was
putting cow mag inside their base to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you out and save you with a bottle company
B was putting the cow mag inside the bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: booster to help you out and save a bottle
and you didn't know that so now you just
[SPEAKER_00]: fed two doses of cow mag because you
combined nutrient companies and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: read the bottles so if you choose to use
products from two different companies be
[SPEAKER_00]: sure not to overlap with any nutrients if
you know what's in each product and you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how the plants use each of
those products and you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause any problems there is nothing wrong
with combining nutrient companies if you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like the brand you were using is
lacking something feel free to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: another product from another company and
add that into your mix as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't double up any specific elements a
good example of what I'm talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial environment I like to run
veg bloom powder nutrients in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: veg bloom could use a little bit of fulvic
acid added to the mix in my opinion veg
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom can use a little bit of
carbohydrates added to the mix later in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower so I am comfortable adding those
products and I've done my research I know
[SPEAKER_00]: how much carbs I know how much fulvic acid
is in my starting product so I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to overdose my plants all
right I'm confident that we understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment I'm confident that we
understand what to feed the plants let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about some more techniques to do at
the very start of flower if you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed pesticide applications now is a
great time to apply a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application we are running out of time for
sprays we are going to start developing
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sites very soon so we need to treat
these plants today let's apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative product to our plants to
ensure we do not get any pests in our veg
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle if you are not going to use spray
pesticide applications now is a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: to release your beneficial insects we want
to get them colonized and built up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow before other insects have an
opportunity to take hold in our flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: garden once the plants are flowering we
don't have a lot of options for pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control so let's do everything we can now
to prevent a pest infestation while we
[SPEAKER_00]: have big chunky buds so I would treat for
pests at this time spray pesticides if
[SPEAKER_00]: that is your approach another thing I like
to do on day one of flower is trellis my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a commercial environment I am
not able to move my veg plants into a room
[SPEAKER_00]: and trellis them I have a veg room and I
have flowering rooms the flowering rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: are constantly flowering so I can't veg in
that room so I move the plants into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering area and I put the trellis up on
day one and I bend and pop and work those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into the net on day one this gives
them plenty of time to recover from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress of getting beat up while they
transition to the flowering phase we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got about seven to ten days where they're
just transitioning there won't be any bud
[SPEAKER_00]: growth there won't be any major activity
so if we beat them up on day one we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of time to recover so I like to get
in there and get them under the trellis I
[SPEAKER_00]: also do popping and twisting which is also
known as super cropping I've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: this in depth in other episodes but I'll
give you a quick rundown I start at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very bottom stalk of the plant where it
comes out of the dirt I grab the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stalk with my left hand I put my right
hand above that and I grab the stalk and I
[SPEAKER_00]: twist my right hand counterclockwise
you'll hear a pop sounds kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckle popping I pop my knuckle into the
microphone I don't know if it picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll hear a little pop sound that is the
sound you're looking for you just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: break the cellulose structure of that
plant so I'll break it once then I'll move
[SPEAKER_00]: my left hand from the bottom right up
above my right hand and I'll give it
[SPEAKER_00]: another break then I'll move up and give
it another break I work my way up the main
[SPEAKER_00]: stem all the way until it gets real thin
and I feel like I could cause problems by
[SPEAKER_00]: snapping it up there once I've done the
main stalk I go back down to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and I find the lowest branch and
I work that branch all the way up then I
[SPEAKER_00]: work every single branch on every single
plant this takes hours in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment your hands will be sore but
the plants will thank you for it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future right now they look like they got
twisted they got a little bit beat up but
[SPEAKER_00]: in a few days all of those twists will
create what looks like a knuckle it will
[SPEAKER_00]: make the plant more robust it will make it
stronger it will give it more strength I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like those thicker stalks can move
more nutrients which makes a more
[SPEAKER_00]: productive plant I feel like a bigger
stalk can hold up a bigger bud so we are
[SPEAKER_00]: working those plants to be more robust by
cracking them they heal themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: they become stronger so I like to do
popping and twisting at this time I also
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do a nice defoliation on day one
of flower take out all that excess leaf we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need it while I'm there I like to
clean up the bottoms quite a bit take off
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the crappy bottom branches take
off some of those sucker branches take off
[SPEAKER_00]: all the bottom leaves we don't need a lot
of that crap on the bottom of our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: some people like to wait a little bit
later closer to week two to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottoming and the lollipopping I like to
do it early in a commercial environment
[SPEAKER_00]: things will get ahead of you so if you
don't start it right away it gets really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to fall behind very quickly and in a
commercial environment that only compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: so on day one I move the plants into the
flower room I set up the trellis I give
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants a nice pop and twist and work
them into the trellis I'll do some
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliating I like to do a bunch of
bottoming and lollipopping and then right
[SPEAKER_00]: before we leave for the night we give the
plants a nice pesticide spray another
[SPEAKER_00]: important thing to think about at this
transitional time is bulbs what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs are you going to use for flowering I
usually recommend a metal halide for
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging and a high pressure sodium for
flowering lighting technology has advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: so far in recent years that you may be
using LEDs you may be using ceramic metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halides there are tons of options but
consider changing your spectrum early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering phase one useful trick I
have learned to help reduce the early
[SPEAKER_00]: flower stretch is to leave the metal
halide bulbs in for the first two weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering a lot of people will swap out
the metal halides for the high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodiums on day one of flowering I have
learned that if you leave those halides in
[SPEAKER_00]: there for two weeks your plants will not
stretch as ridiculously when you initiate
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that is natural for plants to
stretch they just want to take off but
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking them popping them twisting them
and keep in that metal halide will
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically slow down that stretch alright
podcast world I feel like we have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: solid foundation on transitioning our
plants from veg to flower at this point if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are growing from seeds you will need
to keep a close eye on the plants and look
[SPEAKER_00]: out for males you will need to look out
for hermaphrodites and you will need to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention for mutants if you've got a
plant and they're doing some weird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to decide if you want to keep it
or let it finish sometimes those mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants put off amazing products they're
also a pain in the ass to grow and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are problematic so sometimes it's not even
worth it so if you've got a mutant it is
[SPEAKER_00]: up to you to decide what to do another
thing we need to stay on top of is
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting for insects yes we did just apply
some pesticides we may have released some
[SPEAKER_00]: predator bugs but that does not mean that
we are bulletproof always be scouting for
[SPEAKER_00]: pests every day as you walk through the
grow just to go from one end to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: to go get the scissors you forgot down
there or to go find the broom just glance
[SPEAKER_00]: at the plants as you walk by that is when
I make the most random decision
[SPEAKER_00]: discoveries I'm not even looking for
something I was just walking by and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell is that out of the corner of
my eye now I know there's a problem now we
[SPEAKER_00]: can solve it always be paying attention
always be scouting for bugs and problems
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grow keep your eyes open we need to
look for hermaphrodites we need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for males we need to look for mutants and
we need to pay close attention for signs
[SPEAKER_00]: of pests alright podcast world I can feel
the cold medicine that I took starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: kick in my face is going numb my nose is
starting to run kind of weird I need to
