[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far into the show,
I want to talk about a great comedy show
[SPEAKER_01]: that I got to see yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to my friends
at ComedyWorks for treating myself and
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Dredd vibes like rock stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were treated like royalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up, fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great service,
the hospitality, and an extra thank you to
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the comedians that we did get to
see last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was on fire last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show was opened up by a comedian known
as AJ Finney.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude was on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of shit in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever go see his comedy,
you will know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude is called AJ Finney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we are greeted by a dude named Brant
Tobler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Brant Tobler set several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last night he was on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course the show was headlined
by a dude called Ian Fightance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian is always super energetic,
super, super hyper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like he's on drugs, but he swears
he's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of his gimmick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he hasn't done drugs in several
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that he just did enough to where
it's still in him, and I kind of believe
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the show was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all of the performers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the crew at ComedyWorks for
treating us like rock stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra fist bump and a big hug to Miss
Dread Vibes for making it a great evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys go see some live comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laughed so hard that my, I don't even
really have abs, but where my abs should
[SPEAKER_01]: go, they kind of hurt today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I laughed so hard that I was reaching
to move my sunglasses on my head last
[SPEAKER_01]: night because it felt like I had my
sunglasses on my head too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long and it, cause it was hurting in a
weird spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys go see some comedy,
go take too many dabs in the car,
[SPEAKER_01]: then go check out some good comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that is a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I really wanted to
ramble about here at the start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk some business.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends at SeedsHereNow.com are going
to give away a pack of iry genetic seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk more about that later in the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump into a YouTube comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked this comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't read a lot of YouTube comments on
the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to be good comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do, I don't see all of the YouTube
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't check them as frequently,
as diligently as I should maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I did like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one did stand out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from our friend Zachary Johnson,
big up to Zachary Johnson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening to the podcast,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I am loving the older episodes as
much as the new episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reminder, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 784.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 783 other episodes on YouTube
that you may not have listened to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I implore you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the correct word here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the correct use of that word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody check my grammar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comment about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to go listen to those old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they're old, because they
weren't put out today, doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not a lot of gems, a lot of gold
information in those podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still very useful info, very
educational, informative, and entertaining
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasting, if I do say so myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you guys to go check out
all of those older episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say, hey, dude, I miss you putting
out two episodes a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, I wish there was more
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of old shit that I bet you
didn't even listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also goes on to say, it's also nice to
see that your opinions and methods have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed over the years, which means we are
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about that briefly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My opinions, my methods, my approach,
my understanding has changed so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past few years since I started
this show, I'm probably coming up on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's seven or eight years
since I've started this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: 785 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's at least five, six, maybe seven
years I've been doing this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I haven't changed my ideas,
my methods, my approach, my techniques,
[SPEAKER_01]: my understanding that I was not doing
anything right at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was standing still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone from being a small closet grower
to a tent grower, to a basement grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: to a trap house grower, to a
semi-commercial quasi legal commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, to a full on commercial
cultivator, to a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone a long way in my cultivation
career.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of C word letters in that
sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hard not to stumble over all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been in this cultivation game for
so long that if my methods, techniques,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ideas didn't change over all of those
drastic shifts, I would have not gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to learn on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I went from a tent, from a closet
grow to a tent grow, it was a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally different ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The airflow was completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I went from the tent to the basement
grow or the one room in the basement grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a full on different ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I opened up the entire basement
and put the grow in there, that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: fully different ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we started building trap houses and
flooding those with plants and lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a totally different situation
trying to duct the heat from one room to
[SPEAKER_01]: another, because the other room was
getting too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned so many things just by doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trial by fire is kind of how I say it
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got thrown into the commercial
growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was such a huge learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I jumped into that, I was doing I was
hand mixing bottled nutrients in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: cup and just hand watering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was time to go into the big
boy grow and mix up 300 gallon reservoirs
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure I'm getting that shit right
and document everything and then water
[SPEAKER_01]: every plant properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from hand watering every plant
myself to having machines where I could
[SPEAKER_01]: push a button and 500 plants would get
water all at once and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was such a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did everything the same now that I
did back in the day in my first couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, it would not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things would fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, my education just from doing
it, being around the plant, I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like almost any job or art or skill
that you develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you do it, you're going to get
better at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're paying attention, you're going
to see things and start learning the signs
[SPEAKER_01]: and the hints and you'll be ahead of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may see a calcium deficiency before most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may see a nitrogen problem before some
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may hear an environmental piece of
equipment go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before some people just because I've been
there so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying I've been there more than
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have been there a lot, so I've got
a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having done all of these tasks so many
times, I'm very comfortable and very
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with these things and I see
things and start learning things and I
[SPEAKER_01]: take in data very quickly and I've got a
good data processing center in my brain
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can just see I get warnings a little
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: My check engine light will come on before
most people's and will identify a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: before most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see that calcium deficiency maybe
maybe before the other grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may see that nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may notice an environmental factor went
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some machine broke down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being in the gross so long has made
it so easy for me to identify things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I had to do quickly was adjust to
new equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got into the commercial grow,
everything was bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was industrial grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not buying things for just a whole
bunch of small Walmart dehumidifiers like
[SPEAKER_01]: we used to do in the tent grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go buy big Quest and Dan B
dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big 32 or three ton 30 ton air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a big difference than it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running the 12,000 BTU air conditioner in
the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so many things have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology has come so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lighting is way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was first doing this, everybody was
running HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was using big gigantic fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've all got a bunch of little tiny
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day was so much air
conditioning had to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the lights are better,
we don't have to use so much air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skills, the growing, the plants have
come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got better plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got better plants available to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got better nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got better technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got access to so much information
with legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can Google so much stuff before
people in non-legal states would be afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: just to Google how to grow their plants
because they may get in trouble for that
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know how, but they knew it was
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll get in trouble just for
their damn Google search.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technology has brought us a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are still trying to grow the
way that you grew two, three, five years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, you've got to adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn a few more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe find some new equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be the dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be stuck in the old technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't try new things,
how do we improve?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to take some risks and try
new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every artist that you've ever heard about,
every musician, every filmmaker,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody that's been successful that you
have heard of has taken a major step.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've taken a major risk in their career
and had faith in their skills that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have faith in yourself and the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't keep doing the same shit you've been
doing for the past five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is going to come out right
around the second week of January.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start this new year by learning some new
skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said we were going to learn some new
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the risk you're going to take this
year and your grow to learn and improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be afraid to learn some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to the old episodes and you
hear that I was doing this and mixing this
[SPEAKER_01]: way and watering this way and doing this
and I say something different now,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't say, oh, he changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, oh, that guy evolved and he's doing
things differently because in his
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, his research, he's noticed
maybe there was a better way and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people really follow my
guidance, my advice, you buy the products
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't go recommending a lot
of products because it's you can grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of great things, but I like some
specific shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Findable works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you and don't be afraid to switch it
up and try new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there has been a big evolution in me
as a person in the grow in my business and
[SPEAKER_01]: in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for noticing my friend
Zachary Johnson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did say that this episode was going
to be about powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten several messages and emails
about powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody even brought it up on my
Instagram live show recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, how can I get this powdery
mildew off of the buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll spring it, get rid of the powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: The quick answer is yes, you can spray
some products on your plants to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not look like it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will wash it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your clients, customers, whoever will
never know that it was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even do a bud wash at the end,
make it super clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't correct the entire room,
the entire situation, that powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: will keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something more than just powdery
mildew causing the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a, a symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a sign that there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something is wrong in the room and is
being shown to you by powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is probably an airflow problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a moisture problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes down to most likely a VPD
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a vapor pressure deficit problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a math equation evolving your
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't understand that, it's not too
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will stick with temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times when the lights go off in
the grow space, the humidity spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes when the lights come on in the
grow space, the humidity spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those spikes, you're getting a high
humidity point in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are not prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your ventilation equipment is not prepared
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a big spike in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is oftentimes what triggers the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I would recommend is
correcting the spikes that happen when the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights come on and when the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean temperature spikes because it's
been whatever degrees in the room and now
[SPEAKER_01]: the light either goes off or comes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to change probably somewhere
between seven and 12 degrees quite quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperature is going to spike or drop
if the lights going off or on and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to affect the humidity tremendously
depending on the size of the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many plants you've got in there that
will affect the humidity really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend getting some sort of a
monitoring system that will real-time
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor the relative humidity,
the temperature, and even possibly do the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation and monitor the vapor pressure
deficit in your grow space at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then look at the chart after two or three
days of cycling on and off and see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lights on and lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how those spikes are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's figure out if we can set up
some sort of airflow system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an exhaust vent or an exhaust fan
or a blower that we can turn off or on at
[SPEAKER_01]: the correct times to correct this spike in
humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a drop in humidity depends on
what's going on in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it greatly depends on what's going
on in the adjacent rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your grow is up against the outside,
so this wall right here is an exterior
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the grows up against that and it's
snowy outside, you got different
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for different climate
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that light goes off, that's honestly
a bathroom on the other side of that wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the grow was in there, it wouldn't be
as drastic of a change when the lights go
[SPEAKER_01]: off because this room is temperature
controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also going to play into some of
your humidity and temperature and VPD
[SPEAKER_01]: swings in your light change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to think about is something
I kind of mentioned a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lights go off and when the lights
go on, how drastic is that temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: swing?
[SPEAKER_01]: A moment ago, I did mention the
temperature change when the lights go off
[SPEAKER_01]: and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say that it would be somewhere
between 7 and 12 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't like to do much more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lights go off or go on,
I like to keep that daytime and nighttime
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature as close to the same as I can
as possible, but no more than 10 to 12
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees in difference between your day and
night temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's 87 degrees in there with the
lights on and it gets lower than 77,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like 75, 74, 73, that big
temperature swing does give you the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to get powdery mildew in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main things I would think about is
keeping the air moving in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let stagnant air stay in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exhaust and replace that air in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an exhaust fan removing the
stagnant humidity out of the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have passive intakes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have active intakes bringing fresh
air into that room somehow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to bring fresh air in low and suck
that old hot humid air out at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing something like that to
replace, replenish and recycle that air?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that old air in the room
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's have old air, going out,
new air coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep plenty of fresh air moving
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's avoid micro climates and a big
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have fans every three to six feet
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so let's say that there's a
light right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really is a light right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to pretend you could see it
reflecting off my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a light right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they're about two or three feet away
from my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that maybe right here where the
iPad is, that might not get enough airflow
[SPEAKER_01]: because there may be a plant here and a
plant here and a plant here and a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: here and all around and here a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there a plant everywhere, a plant
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here by the iPod, maybe over here by
the microphone, just maybe might not get
[SPEAKER_01]: enough airflow because the canopy is built
up so densely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to create micro climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is going to be a completely
different climate than over there by the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and up here by the top of the
canopy and over here and over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be it's all it might be
slightly different everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have a good movement of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe put a fan on the floor, blowing the
air back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe get a howitzer fan and hang it from
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that fan does instead of blowing the
air left and right, it sucks the air up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the air that is down low, it pulls it
up and shoots it up to the ceiling and
[SPEAKER_01]: stirs the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're operating with CO2,
the CO2 is heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will fall to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The howitzer fan will pick it up,
bring it up towards your plants again,
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot it to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavy, so it will fall again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix with the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep cycling back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're running CO2, definitely use
that howitzer fan or a fan on the floor
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my point is avoid micro climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want air moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way we can prevent powdery mildew
is to keep leaves from touching each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants need a little bit of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves can touch each other,
but not excessively.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got two plants, give them some
breathing room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about if I just walked up to you in
a room at a warm grow space and I just put
[SPEAKER_01]: my hand on your shoulder all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that annoying, but after a while
it's going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get a little bit sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine the leaves of the plants just
touching each other all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also tells them you shouldn't grow
out any wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to grow up in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get stretchy because there's nowhere
else for you to go this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep your plants a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them some growing distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I'm going to recommend is
don't overwater your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand how much water to put into that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of water that you put into
those pots is how much water those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: let back out into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're overwatering, they're going to
let out more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also going to be naturally more
water in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to your watering and also
your watering schedule that could have
[SPEAKER_01]: something to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to water if possible right when the
lights come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they come on, get them wet,
get them watered right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they've got all day to drink that
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lights go off, they've got all
night to metabolize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most productive way to water
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, if you're running hydro,
if you're running cocoa water as needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand we've evolved so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said a moment ago, shit's different
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing hydro and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let me stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you can do is defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take off some of that excessive leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if your pot is here, maybe take off
the lower six inches of just leafy junk on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of that plant because that can
trap a little, like I said before,
[SPEAKER_01]: a microclimate, that lower area of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the water goes into that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights get warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water starts going up that area right
there at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you're going to find a lot of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see a lot of powdery mildew start
right there in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a little bit of lollipopping
and cleaning up the bottoms of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will definitely help minimize the
options of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing you've got to do is
treat the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't repair, treat and correct the
room, the powdery mildew will keep coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your exhaust fan dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your intake fan dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your airflow dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all of your fans in the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the humidifier and the dehumidifier
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get that temperature dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your humidity dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the overall vapor pressure deficit
dialed in in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then make sure that you've got plenty of
air movement, air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then make sure that you've got air
replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you've got an exhaust fan
removing that old air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you've got some sort of intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a way for fresh air to get into
that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, are you supplementing with CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're supplementing, maybe don't get
rid of all that air as frequently,
[SPEAKER_01]: but do keep that air moving around as
often as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then give the plants a little bit of
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them some room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Defoliate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should help you with your powdery
mildew problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a thousand products that I could
tell you to spray on these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a thousand things I could tell
you to do to these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless we treat the room, this powdery
mildew will keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we've got to do is
correct all of the issues in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the first thing we've got to do is
identify why we are getting the powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to check that temperature,
the humidity, the VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to make sure we've got
circulation and air replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's also check on the temperature
and humidity changes when the lights go on
[SPEAKER_01]: and the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the humidity is not getting too
drastic at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's not getting too hot or too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should help to get rid of,
or at least to minimize, powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing we've got to think about is
strain selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know that you're in an area where
you can't control the humidity properly,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially at greenhouse or outdoors,
that's when it does come to selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: proper strains for your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my quick report on powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I helped out your garden.
