[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I've got a head cold or
something, but I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing some work and I got a bunch of
just a bunch of junk in my nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of dust, a bunch of dirt,
been cleaning up some stuff, and it made
[SPEAKER_00]: me sound like total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's coming through on the microphone
and your headphones and your equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't sound like this in the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to blow this junk out of
my nose, out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to sound like shit for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how life is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a great podcast together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not even notice it as much as I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't notice until I put on these
headphones how strong it was, but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: notice there's some crap in the nose from
all the dirty work I was doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I do today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the weed doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in Colorado, we do have the,
uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The right, the privilege of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are offered medical marijuana here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have recreational cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so many people may say, why do you
have your medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation, your medical marijuana
card from a doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off is it's another layer of safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, uh, I do grow, uh, we can grow
legally here, but, uh, also having that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical guard gives you another layer of
protection for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it increases your purchasing power
at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're limited, uh, certain amounts of
milligrams at recreational dispensaries at
[SPEAKER_00]: a, um, a medical cannabis dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edible dosage is much higher that is
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get different products at
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy more at a medical shop than I
can at a rec shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few advantages of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advantages to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly I do it to keep my garden safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does allow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I was going to talk
about, we are allowed recreational and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have six plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreationally are allowed to grow six
cannabis plants in your residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're an adult and you've,
uh, if you want to grow, that's why you're
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, plus if you have your medical
marijuana recommendation, you are allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: six more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have the medical marijuana card
for these six extra plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives me a total of 12, uh, not a lot of
plants to play with, but twice as many as
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps me out, lets me do what I need to
do, uh, supply my medicine, my product
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did go to the weed doctor today
because every year we do have to renew our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana cards here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody 21 and up is allowed to have
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can shop in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you've got a medical cannabis card,
you can be 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the patients are 21 and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require special paperwork,
more doctor visits, extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, uh, 18, but if you're a 21,
then you can get that medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can go to the medical
dispensaries and you can have the extra
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I go get the medical marijuana card
once every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, mine is that I was in a car wreck in
2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knees hit the dash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of terrible noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my shoulder came out of the socket
from the seatbelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care about medic medical
stuff, but that is how that's my,
[SPEAKER_00]: they call it your claim to fame for your
medical marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I had to go to the weed doctor is
what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I used to go to the weed doctor,
you would schedule an appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not watching the video,
I did air quotes on the word appointment
[SPEAKER_00]: because, uh, back in the day when you
would make an appointment to the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor, you'd schedule for, it seemed like
everybody scheduled for 10 or 11 AM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you wouldn't get to see that
weed doctor until five, six, maybe 7 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd have to just hang out all day,
wait your turn, wait for your name to be
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would sneak off and go smoke bowls
in the car or sometimes just wherever we
[SPEAKER_00]: could find a spot to go smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the weed doctors were rare and
they would just see a lot of patients in
[SPEAKER_00]: one day they'd show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is totally illegal now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I talk about it, the weed doctor used
to come to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And set up shop in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just have the weed doctor all day
signing weed cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would charge you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary would make a cut off of
every card that he sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he sold 250 weed cards today at a
hundred dollars each is what I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would make 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just make 10, 10% of his whole day
right there just for letting him be at our
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as he signs that paperwork
and gives you the stamp from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: A notary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're allowed to shop at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spend some more money at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, they quickly, once they made some
rules, they quickly banded doctors being
[SPEAKER_00]: onsite, being present at the actual
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to do it at an offsite location.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't be attached to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was making a little bit too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you have to go sit there all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd have to bring a file of
paperwork with you and explain what was
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and why you thought cannabis would
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, the list of
qualifying conditions was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still a little bit vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we kind of, they kind of did that
on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I like the fact that chronic pain
is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you prove that I don't hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say this hurts, can you look at my
hand right now and tell me if it does or
[SPEAKER_00]: does not hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'll pull it up to the camera right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I full of shit or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a doctor, you've got to take my word
for it that it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're going to give me my medical
cannabis card, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this hurts all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it just does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to say, do you do
anything about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I smoke weed and it feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll go, Oh, and the doctors writes
your card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's pretty much how easy it was
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an appointment, an actual
appointment for 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed up 10 minutes early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey, I'm here for my
appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready to go sign a few things,
scribble your name, date some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how the doctor goes when you
check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it took me, uh, maybe five minutes to
fill out some paperwork, just cause I know
[SPEAKER_00]: all the info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to go digging through shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my info, my social security number,
how old I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I turned in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the doctor will be right with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor came out with the previous
patient and said, have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she called me back and she said,
you look familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I've seen you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting my medical cannabis card
from this office since 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she basically said, okay, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just started writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked me, of course, uh, what hurts,
how do you use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh, my knees hurt and my
shoulder hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take a lot of dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, uh, the state wants me to
type in how much you dab and how you use
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'd probably dab some more
between, uh, depending on the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: some more between one and two grams of
concentrates per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, that's an acceptable answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole appointment probably took me
maybe 20, maybe 30 minutes total with like
[SPEAKER_00]: checking out and paying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a process where, um, once you've
seen the doctor, you do have to go onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of fucking letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the department of public health and
environment, some random bullshit website
[SPEAKER_00]: where they, you have to go there and fill
out your recommendation from the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: and put in some info after the doctor does
their part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you do that, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing, uh, from parking to back
in the car of the entire appointment was
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a 30 minute process today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it cost me 80 bucks to the doctor and
$30 to the state of Colorado, similar
[SPEAKER_00]: around that as 80 bucks, 85, maybe to the
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was 30 or 32 to the state
of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've come a long way, uh, to register
with the state used to be a lot more to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the doctor used to be, uh,
depending on where you went, it could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's really, it was quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my stuff was ready within an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once I filed that paper with the state
of Colorado, I pushed the go button.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email an hour later saying you're
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you used to have to wait in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was the hardest part for a while
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They quit allowing us to have temporary
cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the doctor would sign your shit,
that used to mean you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to mail it to the state and
wait for your card to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point they said the paperwork,
the temp paperwork is no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have the actual card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would see the weed doctor and
you have to mail your shit to the state
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody got a weed card at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody was getting their, uh,
their actual card returned to them for
[SPEAKER_00]: like six or eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to take three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could still be 21 days, but everybody
sent in their weed card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like everybody saw the weed doctor
at one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all sent in their paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took so long for people to get their
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone's like, I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent my shit to the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my weed card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took them so long to get their
shit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was frustrating for a little while
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amongst that group at one point
where I was like, my card should show up
[SPEAKER_00]: any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd love to go buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, luckily dude, I got the hookups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The we, the weed card went super well,
super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the doctor was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this was every time I feel like the
doctors are evolving and it's been two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three, three or four different doctors for
most of my medical cannabis run.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy, an old guy, an older
doctor, a Dr. Reimer's, he had a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a great relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him probably 10 or 12 years in a
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed me off to another doctor who is
now passed me off to this other doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I believe I've seen two or three
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors are getting more savvy,
more educated, more hip to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to cannabis usage, to cannabis,
verbiage, terminology, dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor I saw today actually knew what
she was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hinted and implied that she smokes
medical cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's kind of nice to see the doctor
actually knowing what they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I would go and I would
actually end up educating the doctor and
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time she was on our level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the process was much easier as the big
note that I've got written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they do not pay me any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me to say this, you guys, they did not
give me, they don't even know I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably don't even, they have no
idea who I am, but I'm going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: medical alternatives a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the medical cannabis doctor that I
saw in Colorado Springs today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the process was painless and
streamline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visit was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location was cool to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the opportunity or the
need, I would recommend medical
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does cost a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you are a new patient, you may need
some medical records.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to bring some, uh,
some proof that you are sick or injured
[SPEAKER_00]: and, or have a qualifying condition that
will qualify you for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind those rules are quite
flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some paperwork will help you out
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do offer what is called an extended
plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in many counties in Colorado,
you are not allowed to even honor the
[SPEAKER_00]: extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's an extended plant count?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about that extended plant
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds just like what, what,
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, earlier I said I'm allowed to grow six
plants for my recreational rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just grow six just because we're in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also said I can grow six more because of
my medical rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me six more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My doctor could, if I of course pay them
more money, that's the whole thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give the doctor more money and it's
tiered, uh, if I want to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I'm given six, if I want to go like,
and I'm just hypothetical with the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to add another 10 to 12 plants,
it's like another a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to add 20 to 30 more plants,
it's like 250 more bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to go up more and more plants,
it just tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 350, 500, a thousand bucks,
depending on how many more plants you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which back in the day, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to, I used to rock the shit out of
those extended plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those used to be my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we built dispensaries and businesses
off of extended plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd basically say, uh, we'll give you a
fat discount at our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let us have your plant count
because you get a signed your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a big, it was just
paperwork that we used to jump around
[SPEAKER_00]: through and play with back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the extended plant counts used to be
awesome in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, um, in Pueblo County
where I do live, they don't care about an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Counties have been allowed to make their
own caps on plant limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they can cap plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cap grow size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make the county can decide they
can override.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can supersede any rules that your
state has made, uh, regarding your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pueblo here, uh, we're allowed to have
12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the counties in Pueblo are limited
to 12 total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're paying for that extended
plant count and you're growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: extended plant count, I would do a lot of
research on your location and see if your
[SPEAKER_00]: location does honor, or if it bars that
extended plant count, some places are
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are limited to 12, some give you 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in one of those properly zoned
areas, they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants you grow as long as you're
following your card limit, which could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 99 in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once you cross that a hundred plant
threshold, uh, then you're in that federal
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have so many plants,
I'm sure of it because you have to send in
[SPEAKER_00]: special paperwork and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a computer system that says
fucking Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has 12 plants grow her down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you think they're going to come
looking for when some shit goes wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's on the radar first?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow 12 mind my own fucking
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fly by the, the, the what's it called
fly under the radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the shit out of my nose is
starting to work itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've been talking a little bit,
the mic sounds better in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the weed card went super smooth
today, basically, um, what hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said my wallet and she said,
yep, it's going to hurt more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get a reply from a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode talking about growing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said that if you leave the seeds in
the plants too long, they can get too hard
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will not germinate properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a screenshot of my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The battery is almost dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if we could pull this up
super quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say seeds don't overripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of them getting too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, really quickly, nice and easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they get too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave them in the plant for too
long and you let them grow for too long,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that shell, that outer husk,
the whole, the fucking shell, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed, the bean becomes too hard and
they simply have a hard time germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can soak them in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, uh, scarify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rub them on a matchbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all kinds of shit to them and
they don't germinate very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes you got to put them in a
seed cracker, which I really don't like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you let the seeds go for too long,
they do have the opportunity just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: to get too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's there's not a lot of explaining to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get so hard, they don't germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's from letting them grow for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is most commonly done with outdoor
seeds because I'm learning to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outdoor seeds, excuse me for the
burp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk right over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor seeds seem to go from like
that's almost ready, almost ready,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost ready to fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have cut that, that down
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how I feel like the outdoor
seeds went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, some of them did get really hard,
really big, really fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them did not germinate on a couple
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those never went to anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tested those that I'm not happy with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds will just end up on the
back burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you never know what those will end up
doing, but, um, yeah, some of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: simply got too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best, uh, best description I
can give you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, those are the seeds that you got
to soak in water overnight, or you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in a matchbox and shake them up
to where they get the, the shell gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: little scratched, a little scarified on
the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I've seen people put them in a seed
cracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I mean by the seeds getting
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that can happen that we've
seen happen in outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave the seeds in those plants too
long or leave the plants out there growing
[SPEAKER_00]: too long, the humidity and the moisture
from the outside environment, or just that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture inside the buds can trigger those
seeds to germinate inside of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's really an interesting site to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also terrible because I know how many
seeds are being wasted, uh, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just sprouting right there inside of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a bud that looks like this
microphone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just little germination tails coming
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like worms climbing little
caterpillars or worms climbing out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that is what happens if you leave
them in there too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also a sign we're going to keep
rambling here because we're on a thought
[SPEAKER_00]: process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also a sign to me that the seeds
do not need to be wintered.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk about when the seeds
come out of plants, they need to be cold
[SPEAKER_00]: or they need to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a period of time before they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just normally fall into a cold
environment with some snow or non-ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd need to wait a little while to get
proper environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'd sprout up, but no,
they are ready to go when they're in that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen them sprout inside the buds and
ruin the entire fucking project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, the seeds can go too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you leave them in there way too
long, they will germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this school bus
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to talk about is
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to send a big shout out to my
friend who reminded me to talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with a bro today and he's
like, you know what this and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friend for
reminding me to say this on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be where I am without you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, something I should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make seeds on the back of my seed
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do list a recommended flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those times are generally nine to
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I breed generally takes nine to 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a general timeframe,
but most of my plants will be done within
[SPEAKER_00]: that timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say nine to 10 weeks, I don't mean
cut it down at the beginning of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say nine weeks, I recommend you
finish that ninth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shortchange yourself by cutting down
your plants way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recommending nine to 10 weeks and I
see people cutting their plants down at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ripping yourself off by potentially
14, maybe 21 days of potential growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have gotten from that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how much more weight you could
have gotten from 20 to 14 to 21 more days
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth out of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how much potency, imagine how much
flavor if that plant had that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: time to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypothetically, if you're cutting it
down at the start of week nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 50s, 59 days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 56, 57 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be cutting down at least day 63
is the end of week nine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 56 is eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63 is nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically you've only gone eight
weeks on day one of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to finish that week.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to say, what I'm trying to
get into your head is when I say nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, finish the ninth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say you've got to go to this class
for nine weeks, you don't go to the class
[SPEAKER_00]: for eight weeks and don't go to the ninth
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the same way with growing ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to finish the ninth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you've got to finish the 10th
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes even though I wrote nine to 10
weeks on your package, sometimes you may
[SPEAKER_00]: need to let that bad dog go 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those longer flowering plants
are the most potent, the most heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting, the most delicious, the most
impressive plants in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm saying nine to 10 weeks,
I definitely mean 63 days or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're running the first run with
that plant, definitely go 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend going longer on your
first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the inaugural run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see the potential of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times plants will do special
shit on the last 10 to 14 days of their
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll change terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just go totally different right at
the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into senescence and it expresses
the end of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we never see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know that maybe at the end it
just doubles in size, maybe at the end it
[SPEAKER_00]: doubles in potency, maybe at the end it
puts off this crazy gassy turp you never
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I highly recommend that you let
the plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say nine weeks, that means 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often when I say nine weeks, that means 70
days in breeder talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do talk in ranges and in terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, there are anomalies in these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be phenotypical differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow room is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lights, your environment,
your feed, your temperature, your
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, your VPD, your CO2, all of your
abuse, your love, your care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you cuss the plants out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you give them hugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is going to make a
difference in the flowering time of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend once again that you
let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say nine weeks, again, that is
finish week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say 10 weeks, finish week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get overzealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get eager and ruin everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've edged for how many days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 30, 45 days, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you flower for seven weeks when you
should have gone for nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell yourself short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut yourself off short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rip yourself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success and reach your
potential by letting these plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's happier when you let them
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more question we're going to
cover on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me if it would be possible
to reverse one branch of a plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate another branch of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said yes, that would absolutely be
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should mention is do not
smoke reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that needs to be said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that is something that
needed to be pointed out or talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do not smoke the plants that have been
treated with silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is technically a pollen donor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not buds on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not smokeable bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to smoke female buds anyway,
but many people have said that that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous to smoke weed that has been
sprayed with silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, don't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about it correctly,
you're not going to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never smoke weed that has been sprayed
with silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it possible to reverse that one
branch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one plant, you can grow it
and create two tops on it or two branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can isolate one branch and treat that
one branch with a silver solution at the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper timing, dilution, schedule,
all the right shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat that one branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let that pollen fly wherever you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's likely going to go in the whole room,
but you can hit specific branches if you
[SPEAKER_00]: try hard enough, and you can pollinate the
opposite branch on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done one plant where I topped it low,
let it grow two big, tall tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept the other side pure female,
and I just let those two dance around
[SPEAKER_00]: together, and I made femme seeds out of
one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all the time I've got for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some editing to be done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do some processing to make
this voice sound magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
comb heads, and dread heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for listening to another episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time recording this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt good getting on the microphone and
just talking for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this episode was
educational, informative, or entertaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you'd just like to throw me a few
bucks for
[SPEAKER_00]: taking some time out of my day to make it
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you need is on my website,
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to my buddy,
Root305.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
Bye-bye.
