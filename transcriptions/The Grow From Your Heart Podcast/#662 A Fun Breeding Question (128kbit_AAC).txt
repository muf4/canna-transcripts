[SPEAKER_00]: Join me on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of great stuff to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you on a rainy, cold
Colorado evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit excited to be cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to turn off the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my arms are a little cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of poking a hole in my shirt
over here and I am so excited to be cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a long, hot summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really excited for the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is now what I call powdery
mildew season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gone from super hot to super cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes it is a 60 something at
night and 90 something during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having some jumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're heading into the fall time of
year here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost a couple of weird, uh, temperature
swings in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get some rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get some hail storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have some 90 degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the perfect environment for
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you thought about what you're going
to do when you see the powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you scouting for powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mainly talking about outdoors,
but this will apply indoors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for powdery mildew
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to identify it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of the people working in your grow
know how to identify powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what to do if it is spotted in
your grow because outdoors it is now
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew season in the grow houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a strategy in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what products you are willing to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what willing products it is too late
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what products you can use together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a strategically in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is let time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to talk about that
dog, but again, talking about the dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the chem dog and chem dog and the sour
diesel resulted in several emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they will keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll keep coming as more people listen
to the episode, but I do have a great one
[SPEAKER_00]: here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about this one came from
Patreon, patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta, Jeff, thank you for
replying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, I guess it's hard to put
this into words, but I will try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, I've read this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, I guess the background is
that I learned to self-medicate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the crew, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, growing up, I was a smart kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called lazy by teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And family for years because I wasn't
trying or applying myself, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just bored with the freaking
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach me some shit I care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep teaching me about the same shit over
and over again in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already learned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says as a young adult experimenting,
I found that I could focus and be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful with the help of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what you mean, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I wake up, my thoughts are going
seven different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what needs to get done today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: For breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what shoes I'm going to wear
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a couple of dabs and everything
just goes, you want to have this for
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to wear these shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at nine o'clock you have to go to
this place and it all just falls right
[SPEAKER_00]: into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just smoke a little bit and the pieces of
the puzzle kind of come back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what you mean, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I am the head of, I don't know if
I should read this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read, leave some of this
out because it may reveal too much of who
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody from work reads this,
uh, anyway, our friend is the head of a
[SPEAKER_00]: global company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave out some details
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been smoking since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably close to my age and they
are successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, uh, states, first of all,
that people can smoke cannabis and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can self-medicate with it and they can
become very, very successful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we shouldn't judge anybody for the way
they choose to medicate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says now, um, chem dog was not only the
guy to find the seeds at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog was not the only guy to find
seeds at that time with the grateful dead
[SPEAKER_00]: and fish tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like my friend here may have
stumbled across some of those chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or those dog bud seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we found plenty and many Northern
Vermont and Northern New York people grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody found, if one person found 13
seeds in an ounce and the weed was going
[SPEAKER_00]: around grateful dead shows and fish shows,
there was more of that herb going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just that one ounce had seeds in it,
which is funny because the guys that were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it were hoping to find seeds and
they never did to the best of my
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, but it sounds like they were in
a couple of eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the custies got some of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people in Vermont and New York were
growing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big up to the New York and Vermont
fish family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I cannot wait to boogie down in a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all things go well, uh, now that I try
different chem dogs or chem 91 crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize how much a growers style,
personality and talent play a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I always say that if I give 10 people
a clone of the same exact plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get 10 different finished
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their room is differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their nutrients are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their technique will be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course the dry and cure process is
going to be drastically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get some similar
familiar aromas, flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz will be similar, but there will
be subtle differences amongst every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of the buds will be more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of the buds will be fluffier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe some, if the aromas lean certain
ways, like with the chem 91, we get some
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness and some foot and then some just
weird funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some guys are going to bring out
more foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys are going to bring out more
funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys are going to bring out the
sweetness that has a lot to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the drying and curing
process are going to play a huge role in
[SPEAKER_00]: the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot like a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, uh, if you get 10 bands that are all
professional bands and they play the same
[SPEAKER_00]: song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sound a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll play the same notes, but it's
going to have a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of two bands we could
compare that are going to be anywhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: fair that people may.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say if we took Metallica and
then we took a reggae band and we did the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, you know, take a load off any,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be screaming with Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to do the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the reggae, it's going to be
check, take a load.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be real slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the same song played
correctly, but done with different flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: and different styles because it is very
artist dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you followed along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just compared Metallica and reggae to
cannabis growing on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what we're going to do
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yes, it does play a big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this wonderful message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, since what I'm looking for is not
realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you would have a strain in
your repertoire that might be inspired by
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid nineties fish scene, but what
they've rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, you could probably find some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are from the Vermont, New York
area, somebody's probably got some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those dog bud seeds that you were looking
for, but you're looking for something from
[SPEAKER_00]: the rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff repertoire, the irie genetics catalog
that is chem 91, what they rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, I have a couple of things I
would recommend for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I'm going to suggest will be
the morning dew morning dew is a cross of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grateful dog to my arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of chem in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog is chem D two or it's
chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91 to SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a dead head OG, uh, kind of a
feminized back crossed inbreeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure what I was doing at the time
when I made that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know I was doing something
strange, but I did get some grateful dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, some dead head OG seeds, which is chem
91 and SF the San Fernando Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were across to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the dead head OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some feminizing and reversing of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed a phenotype, the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selfed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took the seed that came out of that
and pollinated that with the original mom
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of did some inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated one of the offspring with the
original mom to make a super fem plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is the grateful dog that has been
crossed to the, uh, the arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has the chem D and the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see the chem D pop up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: That morning dew is very, uh, it's got
the, that sour sweetness that chem 91 had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if you smoked it, there's a
sour sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the dominant flavor, but that's
what kind of gives it a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sour sweetness, but it's also got the
fuel and the cushy aromas that you expect
[SPEAKER_00]: from a good chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the morning dew is probably the
closest you're going to get for a chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: with my sort of a twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that I think you would
really enjoy is a new cross that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will need a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure that I want to reveal
the cross yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we do it here on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in the works of crossing the P 91 to
the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will have some amazing, uh,
gassy funky smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will smell a lot like that old school
stuff and it should have a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: good buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I haven't done it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the room together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time for the magic to happen,
but the P 91 to arise will be something
[SPEAKER_00]: that will make you very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I answered that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, connecting with somebody who was very,
has a very similar story to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, very passionately curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasn't interested in school because
they taught me all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everything I learned in
school, I learned probably in like third
[SPEAKER_00]: or fourth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fifth and sixth grade was just a
repeat of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ninth and 10th grades were
repeats of all this shit all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just repeated it and I didn't
write what they just kept teaching in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't go much further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I learned much more in life,
uh, and became successful as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer after school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we have a lot in common and we
both love that fish tour, grateful dead
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do hope to see you, uh, at a fish
show or a, uh, wherever we end up a dead
[SPEAKER_00]: and company show, maybe a dark star
orchestra show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke some, some good dog weed,
some morning dew or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am awful rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got good in stone at the start of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how long I've been
recording by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be long and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another episode here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that does reference the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when they start like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just listening to your podcast and
you referenced the chem dog and the 13
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a lot of responses because of
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, man, talk about some lineage that
shaped the East coast cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of my favorite strains come from
the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite stuff has chem 91 in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite crosses that I've made
have chem and other chem lines in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it really shaped the East coast
and I think it shaped all of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene to tell you the truth, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just on the East, but yeah,
it started there and trickled out this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, I went camping this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure if I should say exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went camping this year in Bethel for a
Spartan race and took a trip over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Woodstock museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky chatting with an old head who
offered me a quarter of his slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid or slightly seated, but stupid,
stony cookies and chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this herb was slightly seated and
stupid, stony cookies and chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got some girl scout cookies and
then you got some chem in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be chem D, it could be chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot of things, but cookies
and chem, um, that's also known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, GMO is also known as chem cookies or
garlic cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have something like that in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a great cross, but,
uh, he says, maybe it was just the scenery
[SPEAKER_00]: and the atmosphere or whatever,
but I'm telling you, it was some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best herb I have ever touched in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was the atmosphere, the
environment, the surprise of finding some
[SPEAKER_00]: new head at a really cool place,
smoking you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also it was like a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, I feel like if I smoke the same
herb all the time, herb that I grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, herb from the same grovers around
here, if I smoke the same concentrates all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, the same jar, I feel like the
buzz gets boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get as a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medicated, I don't feel the effect as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smoke, uh, one gram of the same
concentrate all day, by the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, I got to switch jars and smoke
something different and then I'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of it was you switching up,
uh, your intake, your medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you ate at a different restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just tasted better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's going to be like that all the
time, but I think that contributed it
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed contributed did to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, uh, that really contributed
to the, uh, the experiences where you were
[SPEAKER_00]: the new, uh, person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then of course, that new product was
totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body was like, well, these are
different terps and different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm not familiar with and different
ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were just out there loving life,
feeling iris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a definitely a good different
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get to the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found eight seeds, one of which doesn't
look viable, but I kept it just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them stashed away for safekeeping,
but man, I can't wait for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that itch to pop these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so if you found eight of them and one
looks unviable, you've got seven seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they say seven is a lucky number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got seven lucky seeds from your
friend, uh, from the Woodstock museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot believe those seeds are not
already germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had gotten those seeds from that head
in that situation, I would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you already be getting tests of what
they grew like from me?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how that would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that the chem dog reference
and the chem dog story brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm glad that that just happened
that, uh, some old head at the Woodstock
[SPEAKER_00]: museum of all places had some slightly
seeded, but, uh, what did the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the word here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupid stony cookies and chem,
whatever you paid for that bag of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, unless what'd you get?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a quarter, uh, you got eight seeds
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you paid around like 70, 80 bucks,
you definitely got a fucking good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you paid 50 bucks, you got a magical
deal because those eight seeds in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion are worth probably 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that would have been worth 50 bucks
or so to me anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, the weed was free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are what you definitely paid
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big come up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this came from our friend poop grows
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, excellent name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, poop does grow no shit, but,
uh, bro, grow those beans and send me
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of them or, or even better send
me some beans, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some chem and cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, who knows what pollinated that that
could be an S one that could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the next chem dog in your
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the next magical strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about where these strains
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we discovered on a previous
episode that even the sour D allegedly
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly was a mistake, a bag seat,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough about the chem stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are more emails in my
Patreon, more emails in the inbox that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have not discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the inboxes are full.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon is loading up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do check the Patreon first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I head to the inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me more messages, patreon.com forward
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is more to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have I been recording?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not press the timer on this device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to go until I run out
of voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this one came from our friend
Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can call me Brian and it says,
Hey Rasta jet.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me thank you so much for all of the
knowledge and experience you share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been given a gift and if
I didn't share my gift, I may
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously combust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I don't record a podcast,
if I don't play my drums, if I don't do a
[SPEAKER_00]: few key things in life, life doesn't go
the way it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thank you for noticing that I do
put some effort and share some knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I was put here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go on with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you maintain a high standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which makes an excellent model for us to
base ourselves off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you hold me to a high standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to fuck up, take a day
off, get lazy, slip up anymore because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the ivory army, the grow from
your heart team, the whole crew is out
[SPEAKER_00]: there cheering me on looking forward to me
coming out and encouraging you,
[SPEAKER_00]: educating you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys keep me on my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep me sharp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You expect a lot from me, which it makes
me expect a lot from me, which makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: expect it's just inspiring me every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motivation, uh, because without you
guys on the other end of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would, I would just be a complete
psychopath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a guy with too many cameras,
too many toys, and this would look fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it says, my question is when you breed
a male and female together, you get
[SPEAKER_00]: certain results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, would the results be
completely different if you switched the
[SPEAKER_00]: male female order and bred those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would there be similarities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what if we were using two females
rather than a male female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would there be different results?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they break down some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely understand the question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into answering this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make this question nice and clear,
what this person is asking, we want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some breeding and we have got plant A and
plant B to start the scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant A is the male and plant B is the
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to breed it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they want to flip the male female
around to where the opposite plant is the
[SPEAKER_00]: male and the opposite plant is the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't remember how I started,
but the second round is the opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I said the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be a difference in the outcome
in the progeny of that breeding project?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we flip them, will we see differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to hypothetically get,
I'm going to say, uh, OG Kush and golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use it to OG Kush male and a golden
goat female and bred them and then did an
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush female and a golden goat male and
bred them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we see differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your phenotypical selection
for your starting plants, most likely,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, you will see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the male, in my opinion, adds a lot to
the structure, the shape of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the potency of the plant, the mildew
resistance, the pathogen resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like come from the pollen donor
side of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see, and also it depends on how
dominant each plant is in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's just say they're even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say we've got even dominance on
everything we've selected that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to breed evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really just not common with
anything in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, if we breed them, so you're going
to see, uh, you may see more of the dad's
[SPEAKER_00]: tallness in each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get the, the height of the dad in
each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get the pest resistance from the
dad in each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, OG, so OG Kush, OG Kush
likes to get a little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat gets really thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever dad you used, I think you're
going to see that trait more dominant in
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the golden goat dad,
your offspring are going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the OG Kush dad, your offspring
will be less thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, either way you do that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you use this two same
plants, just flipping the dad,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll have an effect on the amount
of thirst in those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hypothetical because I know
that golden goat drinks and eats like
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the OG Kush plants,
uh, they don't drink very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost, uh, starve them and not
give them water for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, uh, you're more likely to kill
an OG Kush plant by overwatering than
[SPEAKER_00]: under watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm trying to get with
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good example is if we crossed the
grateful dog to the golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: this has been done, uh, one way it is
called the golden road.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way it is called the heart of
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, my brain's playing tricks on me
because I'm talking and trying to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about these two strains and don't have
notes on it in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But grateful dog and golden goat have been
crossed each way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where the grateful dog has been the
pollen donor and the grateful dog has been
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the golden goat is the pollen donor,
the progeny makes sweeter, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: pointier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sweeter in flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got more of that tropical flavor
and they are pointier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, they're jagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are more serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are, uh, maybe a little bit Fox
taily, but they just look meaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silhouette is just more sharp and
jagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of phenotypes,
I call it the mean girl phenotype of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I cross with golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cross that the grateful dog is the
pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those come out with more of a rounded pine
cone shaped bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't as jaggedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have as many, uh, maybe it's
almost Fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's fingery, but when I use the
grateful dog is the pollen donor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks more like a tight silver pine
cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets this silver hue to it,
a silver tent, maybe a velvety sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: texture, a little bit of purple to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's what happens when the
grateful dog is the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you will see differences,
uh, based on flipping the male and the
[SPEAKER_00]: female, you'll see differences and it just
depends on which male and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find some males that when you breed with
them, they're really dominant in the mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll find some males that just mix
really well with the female and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find some that you're just making
reproductions of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of about the dominance of the
male in your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really going to have a huge
effect on it, but you will see a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in which way you do the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying with the grateful dog
to golden goat, when the golden goat is
[SPEAKER_00]: the reversal, that flavor of the golden
goat comes through a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering time of the golden goat
comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I use the grateful dog is the
pollen donor, the flowering time of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog, the leaf shape and size of
the grateful dog seem to dominate that
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there absolutely is a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the last part also, what if you were
using two females rather than a male
[SPEAKER_00]: female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would there be different results?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I was going with just
now because I didn't even realize I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about two feminized crosses,
but yes, you will see the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work just like the boy girl,
uh, maybe easier to see because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the females in full flower as their
female, but expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can identify the traits which are
coming from each side very accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know what the females look
like when you're using the boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you just know what the female looks
like and you're guessing the other traits
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the boy side, not, uh,
traits from the history on the mom's side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they wrap it up with, I hope you
understand the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you understood my long and rambly
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that came from my friend.
