[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has become a tradition that
we start this podcast off by talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of honeysuckle live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of lemon essence and Han
Solo burger on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as honey,
sweet lemons and floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about this concentrate on
the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that sweet honey flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that touch of floral tropical
flavor at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like the most is the nice chilled
out buzz I get from the honeysuckle live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a little bit of tunnel vision
and puts on the blinders that helps with
[SPEAKER_00]: my focus makes me chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is perfect for podcast
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the honeysuckle live
batter.

[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before we get too far into the
show, I want to mention one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you and invite you to come
check out the updated I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is still under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people have been asking how
to get the golden goat, orange Gazm and
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey t shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to get them is to visit I
read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the website, there is a store
link at the top of the page, click on that
[SPEAKER_00]: store link, it will take you to the
official I read genetics store where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get your t shirts that will make it
nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse our mess on the website,
the website is under construction,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will evolve very heavily over the next
two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the next four weeks, that website
should look stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to everybody who's been working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website for me, who has been emailing me
and calling me asking me for guidance and
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I put this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we put here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a website is not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of work would drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the help and for the hard
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to see the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important part right now you guys is
that the t shirts are available on the I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics website, go to the I read
genetics.com website, click on that store
[SPEAKER_00]: tab, grab yourself some shirts,
show some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and big thank you to everybody
who's already grabbed a golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lemon Jeffrey or an orange Gazm t shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more t shirts and more designs
coming very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in works with a couple of printers to
get things coming quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One design is being held up by myself
because I cannot decide which color to
[SPEAKER_00]: print the design on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as I get my shit together,
make some final decisions, send a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: emails, there will be new designs coming
for the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned and excuse the mess,
but please do check in often on I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all of the business part
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the fun part of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the portion of the show where we
read messages from our Patreon viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first Patreon message today comes from
our friend Big Huff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, what's up rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two golden goat s ones,
an orange Gazm and a stir fry going sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like a great mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what stir fry is,
but the orange Gazm and the golden goats
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow beautifully together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have them in two per
which is a cocoa perlite mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically think it is heavy on the
perlite side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not completely sure what the mix is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good mix in two per I know it is a
good quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do approve of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two per I buy doesn't have perlite in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure the ratio you've got,
but it is a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on the bag of two per it says to
water one to six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where the question comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so if I watered it only once a
day, it basically stays on a five in a one
[SPEAKER_00]: to five water tech weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking maybe should I ignore
their one to six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's unpack something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that if you're not a podcast
listener, if you haven't been following
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, maybe you don't know what I
mean when I say one to five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it stays at a five when he waters
it and waters it multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through five water tech is a watering
technique that we have developed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow environment that allows me
to train people very easily on when and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to water our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants are in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this we're going to go with the
cocoa and perlite mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big huff is using here when we water
that plant completely saturate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get about 10 to 20% runoff when
we water that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're done watering that plant is at
a what I'm going to call a level five for
[SPEAKER_00]: watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is as saturated as that plant can get
it can't hold any more water on a scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: one to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a five as it begins to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's going to dry up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to a four number four
doesn't need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, you watered it a little bit
ago and it is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to check on that plant for
a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three is when you go, Oh,
we're going to need to water that plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be just about time to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can wait a little bit and there won't
be any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A level two and one to five water tech is
when the plants are going, Hey guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: water me, please give me some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is when you walk in the plants
are going, Hey, motherfucker, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: have watered me two hours ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basics of one to five water
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we know one to five water tech,
you pick up the pot, get a pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: saturate it, make it as wet and heavy as
it gets, pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that that's how heavy that plant
should be when it is fully fully water,
[SPEAKER_00]: get another pot and don't put any water in
it, fill it with your cocoa, fill it with
[SPEAKER_00]: your perlite, pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a level one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant gets to that one,
it's dry, it's fucking dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how light that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how light a number five is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as you water the plants, pay
attention to them, see how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: reacting and responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn where four is learn where three is
learn where number two is, you'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell by touching the plants by looking
at the pots by picking them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly by looking at the color of the
cocoa, you'll be able to look and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go that pot right there is a five,
that one's a four, that one's a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not water the fives at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fours are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about watering the threes and
definitely give the two some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basics of one through five
watering tech so that you know what our
[SPEAKER_00]: listener is referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on his package of cocoa, they
recommended that he waters his plants up
[SPEAKER_00]: to six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't think that that is good
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your pot size, you're
probably accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't water six times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky to get two waterings per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as much as I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's jump back into the email so I
can give you accurate advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I ignore their one to six times per
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice it says one to six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you to do it six times up
to six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says today I'm going to try to
skip a day and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems strange to keep them so
soaked all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't want them too soaked all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them about that level three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to saturate them to a five,
let them dry up to about a level three,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe touch level two, then resaturate to
a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long that's going to
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they say up to six times per
day is sometimes people are running large,
[SPEAKER_00]: large plants in very small containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're doing cocoa with perlite in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is essentially a hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat this the same as hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not living soil in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa doesn't hang on to any
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically hydroponics in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a lot like cocoa or it looks a
lot like a soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, this is a hydroponic grow
when we treat it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing in a little tiny pot
like a one gallon pot or a six inch net
[SPEAKER_00]: pot may be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's going to dry out rapidly if
you've got a big fat plant and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: air moving around in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pot may get six waterings a day,
but I'm in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants get watered in the morning at
9am.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sometimes before we leave,
sometimes it's five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we wait till six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bigger plants really need it,
they will get watered again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm mostly watering once or twice in
the summer with giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we may get a third watering
indoors, but that's uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get past that three by the time
we come in in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we water them again before we leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not necessary to water six times
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't follow the instructions on the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying follow the instructions that
the plants are giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitors are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Books are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advice is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My word can be wrong sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants say, fuck you, Rasta Jeff is
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather you water me 34 times a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you need to be watering
up to six times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sounds like you may need to be
watering every other day depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of your pot, how long it stays
saturated, how the plants are reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one through five watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get to a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep over watering, you can cause
root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little bit of green algae on
the top of the cocoa there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that will encourage fungus gnats to
come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overwater too heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep them soaked like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely correct that it does
feel strange to keep them soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them swampy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them drowning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what they prefer, especially
smaller plants, you'll drown the shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get bigger, you can water the fuck
out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they're small like that,
you do risk the run the risk of drowning
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to read your email while I'm
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me focus on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if I watered multiple times a day,
do you not water to run off each time I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep it as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I trying to keep it as wet as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't keep it as wet as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow that one through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it fluctuate from like a one to a 2.9
and then water that shit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always water to run off when using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do it six times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do water, water with runoff
because if you don't water with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of runoff coming out of there,
you will build up salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just pouring the Kool-Aid in and
the Kool-Aid powder stays somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle and it doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time you water, you're just
watering more Kool-Aid powder on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: more Kool-Aid powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse that shit all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse it all the way through saturate the
soil get the excess out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure to saturate that will make
sure that you don't get lockout problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll keep the pH and the EC inside the
rhizosphere nice and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my advice to you follow one
through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag doesn't know what kind of plants
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupper doesn't know how big your pots are
or your environment is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says up to six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is up to six zero is still up to
six times per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let the plants be the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that one through five water tech that
we've talked about and rely on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sound like a smart enough person
that I think you'll know when these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: need some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Big Huff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing an update on how
you adjusted your watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Papa
Wheely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear from Papa Wheely quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from me, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope things are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came in a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should have gotten to this
message quite a bit ago, but I just found
[SPEAKER_00]: this in the folder and it goes just like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been putting out lately and
seamless quality sound with adding mic
[SPEAKER_00]: into recent episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that people appreciate Mike
and that he still sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to keep Mike on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting better at it and he will be
back on the show very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who keep asking Mike,
people are asking for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get you on the show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, Rasta Jeff,
I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently had a whodunit in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was holding on to a UK mail,
a UK cheese mail in my clone and seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: area, which is a big modified rubber made
tote in one of my bedrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend had a mail in a makeshift
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I wasn't aware that
mails through pollen, even if they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: been switched to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like our buddy's plant spit out
some pollen a little bit early,
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little excited and let it go too
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and says, I originally thought
that there was some light leak issue in my
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room and there was a little light
leak getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also believe that the mail pollen could
have traveled under two doors in my
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom and made it to flower room to a
flower room about 30 feet away and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated five amnesia fems in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like our buddy had a male
plant and now he's got seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: females, which he did not expect because
they were far enough away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also he didn't plan on that male
skeeting that early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like he's got questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they were loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably got a hundred so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if they were loaded,
you'd have thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big your plants are,
but loaded your idea of loaded and my idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of loaded with seeds are probably
different, but still a bummer either way
[SPEAKER_00]: that your crop is all seeded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said crop, excuse me for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the word crop real big across the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All funny again too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say about 30 feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: My questions are as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it true that male plants can flower
without changing their light cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to pollinate a whole room?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my second question is if you pollinate
a self-feminized plant with male pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that give you a higher ratio of
female seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a couple of good questions in
here that I can answer for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it true that male plants can flower
without changing the light cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be caused by several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant may not be getting enough
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if they don't get enough light,
if they're getting shaded, if the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period is too short, if they're not
getting basically enough light,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the PPFD is not enough for that plant,
it may go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if it has got a too small of a pot,
if it is root bound, it may go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some plants just decide that they go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that male plant came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it's a UK cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was bred to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes plants just decide to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could have been a genetic trigger in
that plant that said, hey, you're old
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been an environmental
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been something such as too
small of a pot or too little of a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things definitely could have made
that plant flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, absolutely enough to pollinate an
entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not take much pollen at all to
pollinate the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant was in there pollinating all
night long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fans were blowing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably carried some pollen on your
clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that is very likely, very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it probably got root
bound or didn't have enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the most common factors to make
a male plant flower too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question is if you pollinate a
self-feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take an S1 plant, a feminized
plant, if you pollinate a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized female plant with male pollen,
does that give you a higher ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: female seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my understanding, in my belief,
the pollen, the sex of the plant comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that male plant is throwing off
pollen, there is a chance that that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: is male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where your decision is going to
come from in your offspring was that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What supports that theory to me is that I
could make female seeds by manipulating
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part I'm manipulating is the male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part I'm manipulating is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that by manipulating that
plant that I can create all female pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: and not have any male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm kind of, Mr. Soul gave me the
idea that we are filtering out the male
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen when we make a feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that you will make more
female plants that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think since you're using a male plant,
that is the one going to throw out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50, 50 male, 50, 50 female
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that that will not make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to get still 50,
50 offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, my supporting evidence is
because we can make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen donor decides the sex,
in my opinion, from what I've been reading
[SPEAKER_00]: lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that's going to work the
way that you're thinking it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see if there's any more
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I wrapped up everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope my male to female comparison makes
sense there why you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is decided by the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it lands in the plant and makes the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have that outcome, that offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decision is made there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've covered this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root bound or not getting enough light is
why they flowered and pollinated your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to be a high number
of females.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do wish you the best of luck in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa Wheely, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you grown any of those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to do is grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you give a solid disclaimer that
those were accidental beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another message here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from let's see,
do they want their names said?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want their names that I don't
think it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, man, I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I only discovered you about six
months ago, but I've listened to a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: now and I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says your lengthy grow lesson
compilation on episodes 401 through 405
[SPEAKER_00]: were incredibly informative and got me
hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't heard grow lessons,
episodes 401 through 405.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are intense, very in depth grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took several lessons that I had done
previously and compiled them in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific order to make it basically a
starting to grow and finishing a grow 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to those lessons,
you can pick how to grow where to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: when to grow, why to grow, how to plant
your seeds, how to cut your clones all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to cutting them down and smoking
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes 401 through 405 will get you
through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've just found the show,
I encourage you to travel all the way back
[SPEAKER_00]: to 401 and give a listen there and share
it with your new grower friends because
[SPEAKER_00]: they really need to hear a lot of that
info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our new friend became hooked after 401
through 405.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you are hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you have listened to a lot of
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sticking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those old episodes are
embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you made it through those with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on it says anyway, thank you for
all of the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a hobbyist small time
personal grower, and I have only ever used
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sorted through the dude and half
dudes and had a good time doing it but so
[SPEAKER_00]: he means he's pulled out male plants and
intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says but recently I found my way to an
amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they've decided to grow them
hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the questions come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've gathered up my supplies
including a full assortment of advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, nutrients, and supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys say advanced nutrients,
nutrients and supplements without thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: you said something funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes total sense but say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, it goes on it says, but I've
never dealt with any of them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always run the simple Fox Farms trio
and my soil and that's what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he gives some info.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I finally my question is,
I have four girls which have just hit week
[SPEAKER_00]: four of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just now flush them for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud growth is promising and all of the
leaves are left healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I've just flushed, can I switch
from the Fox Farms, Tiger Bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Bloom to the advanced nutrients,
Cincy Bloom and all of the supplements and
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary elements mixed in the middle of
this flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used any nutrients other than
the FF3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your help is greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's some more details included
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part I skipped before talking
about the grow, which we can look right
[SPEAKER_00]: over that part right now there's other
stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, why are you flushing weekly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary to flush once a
week unless you've made a mistake unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you've overfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing once a week is more stressful,
more detrimental than good in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: to your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a hydroponic grower, not a deep
water culture guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've noticed is when you feed the
plants is when they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you feed the plants is when they get
bigger, beefier, badder, stronger,
[SPEAKER_00]: more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you going to skip feeding times?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a day a whole time that those
plants could have been eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not flush them until the very
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find flushing unless you have
fucked up made a mistake overfed,
[SPEAKER_00]: something is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't flush until the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my feedback, my advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extra work to do it in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to empty the reservoir,
refill it, re pH it, let it run for
[SPEAKER_00]: however long you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know if you dump it and then
refill it or if you just add nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: that and top it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a hydro guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, but it's more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just dump the res on Monday,
refill it on Monday, and then have that
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh set for the week and not do the
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are hydroponic experts out
there, tell me why you flush once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy said he did the first flush a
week for I don't understand why that's
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he says plants look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud growth is promising leaves are
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you flushing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main question is, can I switch
from Fox Farms to Advanced Nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would switch during that flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flushed them out, switch right
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just switch any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the middle of the week,
you can dump out that reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can refill it and you can put in that
new nutrient system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the main part of the question is,
can I switch nutrients here at week four
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of this cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main answer is yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason not to switch to a
better product, a more advanced product,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that advanced does offer a lot of
different bottles, you can really dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mix really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see something is off, you can add
more of one thing instead of having four
[SPEAKER_00]: different nutrients or elements in one
bottle, you can't add some of that one
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all four in there,
you're going to add more of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced Nutrients breaks it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use advanced, it wasn't my
favorite, I have moved on from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can switch in the middle of your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, it looks like you deep
water culture guys probably dump out a
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir one day of the week,
you clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're flushing at that
point, then refilling it, then adding
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when I would do the switch,
I would dump it out, refill it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to do the flush,
if you insist on doing the flush,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, this would be the best time for
it, then add those new nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay really close attention to how those
plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem won't be that you switched
brands, the problem will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: unfamiliarity of the new brand,
you're gonna have to pay attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn to watch for a nitrogen toxicity or
a Cal Mag deficiency, or just know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at the plants and be
prepared to adjust on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Advanced Nutrients is a completely
different game than playing with those
[SPEAKER_00]: three Fox farm bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make the switch, do it during
one of those reservoir changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you insist on flushing, do it right
after one of those flushes, that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the times that I do recommend a
flush, the times that I do find a flush to
[SPEAKER_00]: be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I wouldn't even do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this may be a good time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your flush if you choose,
fill your res back up, put your nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in there at the recommended rate,
maybe go a little bit lighter than the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended rate, depending on how much
stuff you're going to use, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how good you are at watching the plants
reactions, maybe go half strength,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe go three quarters, you can always
add more, but you can't undo nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see them starting to get a little
bit yellow, if they're reacting like they
[SPEAKER_00]: need stuff, we can give them more,
but we cannot take nutrients out once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already in there, you can dilute your mix,
but by now you've already seen a burn or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can switch, just pay good
close attention for the first couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days after that, pay close attention to
how those plants respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need stuff, give them stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've had too much, dilute your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to put more water in your
reservoir, make the nutrient solution a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit less rich, dilute it,
bring down your PPMs just a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: then adjust the pH again after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I would do, I am not
going to completely dis advance nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is not the type of show this
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say that I tried
advanced nutrients several years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've tried several products since
then, and I have never looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not happy with my results from
advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get the things they advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They advertise 30% bigger crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I used all of this stuff,
and I did it correctly, and I pushed my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, and I was in there every day doing
what needed to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got those big fat 30% heavier crops,
but what I did not get was a room with
[SPEAKER_00]: very expressive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not dissing the brand,
I'm just saying this was my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I used different nutrients,
if I plant five different plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: clone that from five different plants from
clone that I know have distinct traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see those distinct distinct traits
if I use different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was using advanced nutrients,
all five of those plants looked,
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled and tasted very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tasted like advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag is what they all tasted like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to diss the brand or
your grow or your decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do encourage you to pay attention to
the quality of your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that 30% more weight what you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is unique flavors and aromas what
you're going after?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about what you want to do with
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my grow, I wasn't excited with the
advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize to advanced if it feels like I
just kicked you right in the dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great people, great products, not the
product for my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to thank our friend who
did not include their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name given
out on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the info that they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got any input or feedback on
that flushing part in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic grow, I'd love to hear why
you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what it's doing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory is if nothing's wrong,
don't flush, no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're on a good diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly, you just starve me for
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to piss me off more than it's
going to do anything to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my feedback, my opinion,
and my input there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
